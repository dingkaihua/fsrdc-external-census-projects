The first will enhance the export and import information on Economic Censuses and Surveys. We will develop and test linkages between transaction level Foreign Trade data and Economic Census and Survey data and compare the links developed by CES to those developed by the Census Bureau’s Foreign Trade Division (FTD). If improvements in linkages methods are identified, we will provide advice to FTD. The second phase will analyze transaction level detail to examine changes in foreign trade transactions, focusing initially on related party transactions, potential underreporting, and impact of FTD outreach efforts. This component of the project will focus on identifying reasons for such changes. The third phase of the project will develop empirical and analytical framework to investigate the impact of trade on the U.S. economy - focusing on how firms allocate economic activity between domestic and foreign production and the impact of this on the domestic economy (including workers and regional economies). This component makes use of the data developed in the previous phases to develop new estimates of the impact of foreign trade on U.S. industries.

8,Completed,Do Plants Move? - Evidence of Relocation in U.S. Manufacturing Plants,CMU,2001,2001.0,Yoonsoo Lee,"A firm can grow over a sustained period of time by renewing itself through recurrent responses to various internal and external challenges. In the short run, a firm expands and contracts its activities and the number of workers it employs. Some radical changes in the environment, however, may lead a firm to shut down a plant and start over in a new location. Because of this, competition among state and local governments to lure businesses has attracted considerable interest from economists, as well as legislators and decision-makers, regarding issues influencing relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities. While this process of relocation can cause dramatic shifts in activity and employment at the regional levels, as well as at the firm levels, very little is known about the actual patterns of relocation in the U.S. economy. Only a few previous studies have looked at how manufacturing firms geographically locate their production, and most of these have focused on either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This project expands on this previous work by summarizing the patterns of plant relocation and the post-move performance of relocated plants using the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period 1963-1999 using non-publicly available plant and firm level data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Focusing on an individual firm’s decision to relocate, this project analyzes information on the relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities in the following three subprojects. First, this project assesses the relative importance of relocation across industries and regions by constructing industry level measures of entry, relocation, and exit. The study then examines whether relocation produces different patterns in plant openings and closings compared to de novo entry and permanent exit. Second, this project studies the characteristics of relocated plants along with their decision to relocate. Econometric model estimation will characterize how individual firms’ geographic shifts of production processes are influenced by taxes, unionization, factor prices, ownership, and other geographic and plant specific characteristics. Third, this project investigates the impact of geographic shifts on a firm’s post move production by comparing the growth rates of output and productivity for newly relocated plants to those of existing plants in the original location. The inverse growth-age relation suggested by Jovanovic’s (1982) firm- learning model is tested for relocating plants to examine whether the inverse growth-age relation observed among young firms also holds for relocating plants that start over in a new space. This project provides a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. These benefits include producing new statistics on the geographic movement of manufacturing activities at the firm level thereby suggesting a new way to expand the utility of the LRD in describing the geographic patterns of economic activities in the United States. Results of this research may also demonstrate the need for new measures of relocation to be incorporated in future surveys. Additionally by establishing links to the original plant of relocated plant, this research examines the consistency of geographic identifiers by potentially identifying previously undocumented coding problems and improves the understanding of regional linkages in the LRD. A better understanding of the dynamic geographic distribution of firm activity will help characterize the patterns of firm ownership that could be valuable for designing inquires on the Company organization survey that is an important Title 13 component of the Standard Statistical Establishment List.",1,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first goal is the completion of the construction of a unique, very large, representative data set on workers, employers, and employer characteristics, where the employer characteristics are obtained in part from information on the multiple workers working for each employer.  For each individual worker in the data, this data set will also include detailed information on both residential location and geographic location of the place of work.  This matched employee-employer data set will represent a significant improvement upon existing matched data sets for the U.S., and result in gains to the Census Bureau in terms of new data products and improvements in current data programs.

11,Completed,Productivity Dynamics and Capital Adjustment Patterns in U.S. Food and Kindred Product Industry: Plant and Firm Level Analysis,CMU,2000,2001.0,Pinar Celikkol Geylani,"Productivity advancement has been a major contributing factor to economic growth in the postwar U.S. economy and more accurate measurement of productivity and growth will assist future industry and government decision-making activities. The proposed research address some fundamental issues related to productivity and growth in the food-manufacturing sector by focusing on the stimuli to productivity growth. By focusing on the investment patterns of Food and Kindred Products Industry, this project will
• Examine the behavior of capital adjustment patterns of plants and firms
• Examine the dynamic factor demand decisions and resource allocations of the constituent units of the firm
• Examine long-argued capital measurement problems surrounding the time series data
• Investigate implications of the empirical evidence for the shape of the adjustment cost function
• Analyze productivity changes of plants and firms under these capital adjustment cost and investment patterns
• Identify and distinguish the gains from investment spikes as indicative of the lifting the plateau to a new one that can lead to longer periods of productivity growth from the productivity gains within an investment period. Thus this proposal intends to take the literature one step further by investigating how capital and its adjustments influence productivity.
Generally, plant-level studies analyzing productivity dynamics concentrate on the overall manufacturing plants in U.S., while studies analyzing productivity issues in the Food and Kindred Products industry primarily concentrate on the aggregate level. There are currently no studies that analyze the productivity dynamics at the most disaggregated plant level, considering all product subgroups of the food-manufacturing sector. With this study, we will be able to focus on investment patterns and lumpy capital adjustment costs separately analyzing all sub-industries of the food sector, which allows us to capture extensive heterogeneity within and across industries. The Food and Kindred Products industry is an excellent candidate for investigating lumpy investment patterns as the industry has become increasingly capital-intensive, and high-tech over the past few decades in the processing, packaging, and marketing of food products (Morrison, 1997). Therefore, the data required for this research is the U.S. Census’ Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for the years 1963-1999 containing the annual establishment level production data for the manufacturing plants and firms specifically in Food and Kindred Products Industry. This non-publicly available Census data is crucial for understanding the productivity dynamics, the forces of productivity transition and the performance of the industry micro-and macro-level. The LRD has detailed information on products produced, employment and capital investment, labor, and material and energy at both the plant-level and firm level, as well as information on whether firms are single-plant or multi-plant firms. Additionally variables on the size of the establishments by employment and the age of the plants can be defined. For an accurate measurement of productivity growth, we need to consider economies of scale, productivity enhancing changes arising from factors such as experience, learning-by-doing, increased knowledge, new innovations, better techniques for producing output, measuring relative capital intensity of production technology, existence of quasi-fixity of inputs, and the adjustment cost of these factors. As capital input is a significant component of total cost, analyzing the behavior of quasi-fixed factors in the measurement of productivity is crucial, especially if the firms require massive amounts of capital in the form of plant and equipment. Therefore, confidential Census data is essential to investigate the effect of capital adjustment on productivity and to develop a method, which can control for plant and firm fixed effects in measuring the productivity at plant and firm level. This research will provide benefit to the Census Bureau by developing a new improved measure of economic growth associated with investment spikes. This methodology removes procyclical biases associated with the business cycle. Thus it has the potential to propose changes in the questionnaire design and collection methodology to improve the economic content of the information gathered by the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) in the area of capital input series and total factor productivity at both the plant and firm level. By computing productivity at both levels, the researcher will be able to separately estimate both plant level productivity and firm level productivity in relation to aggregate level productivity. Previous studies have shown that aggregate growth measures may be significantly reduced when using the plant level data. Therefore the disaggregated measure of total factor productivity generated by this research will assist the Census Bureau in determining and evaluating whether the aggregation problem found in the literature is due to underlying economic forces or if it is possibly due to the questionnaire design or collection methodology.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project examines those plants that experience large movement in their relative productivity, or in their relative wages, over the LRD time period. In particular, we wish to estimate the likelihood of sizeable (and consistent) movement in relative productivity or wages as a function of industry, plant size, firm size, sales growth, and geography (urban/rural, region).

It will regress the individual-level wage and employment outcomes against the local job flow measures, controlling for time- and area-specific fixed effects and observed personal characteristics such as age and race.

26,Completed,Firms and Layoffs: The Impact of Unionization on Involuntary Job Loss,Triangle,2001,2001.0,Vanessa V Tinsley,"The National Employer Survey (NES) was administered by the Census Bureau on behalf of the Educational Quality of the Workforce Program to conduct a survey on employers’ hiring and human resource practices. The proposed project extends the use of the NES beyond the issues of training and education and informs broader labor market issues by focusing on variable data that has been collected but has not been extensively used. In doing so, this project will yield clear benefits to the Census Bureau’s data program. The 1997 National Employer Survey – Phase II is one of very few employer surveys that contains data on involuntary job loss and collective bargaining coverage at the establishment level. An important human resource issue is how employers manage changes in employment levels. Employers in the United States have been facing increasing pressure to eliminate jobs; thus, employees are experiencing a decline in job security. Unions, as the only institutionalized means of worker representation, can be expected to have an impact on whether or not management considers workers’ interests when making decisions regarding changes in employment levels. This project merges the NES establishment-level data with industry-level and local labor market characteristics to identify factors affecting involuntary job loss, with a particular focus on unionization. Access to non-public data provide the Census Bureau data program with the following benefits: (1) an enhanced database created by merging NES-II data with contextual data such as the Herfindahl Index, industry unionization rates, local unemployment rates, industrial production indexes, and industry imports, allowing comparisons with the AMA and MCTES data; (2) an increased understanding of the quality of the data for use in econometric analyses and an evaluation of the quality of the data by comparing coefficient estimates to estimates obtained from the AMA and MCTES data; and (3) documentation for new data collection needs to understand employer behavior.",1,Non-Employer Business Register,NBR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

44,Completed,"""Marrying Out"" and Fitting In: Interracial Households, Residential Segregation and the Identity of Multiracial Children",UCLA,2001,2004.0,John Mark Ellis,"We propose a three-year study of the residential choices of interracial partners to expand our understanding, empirically and theoretically, of multiraciality and interracial partnerships in American metropolitan areas. The basic questions we intend to address are as follows: Do interracial families live in segregated neighborhoods? Do they live in neighborhoods dominated by a particular race/ethnic group? Does this depend on the race of the male partner or the female partner? Do the social class positions of the partners affect the couple’s residential choices? These initial steps in the investigation of the residential geography of interracial households set the stage for us to address a set of derivative questions associated with the permanence of ethnic and racial boundaries. In particular, what are the implications of the geography of residential choice for the childbearing decisions and the racial/ethnic identity of children of interracial couples? To answer these questions we will make use of two data sets. The first contains detailed individual level information from a special version of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. These data provide a one in six sample of individuals that permits us to study the residential location of interracial couples at the scale of the census tract. Simply stated, these data allow us analyze the residential location of interracial couples with previously unavailable geographical detail. The second data set is mortgage application information from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. These data record the race of single and joint applicants for home mortgages and the tract location of the property for which the loan is sought. We intend to merge these data for a number of years in the 1990s to analyze the residential preferences of interracial couples. The analysis will benefit the bureau in four ways: improvements in ethnic and racial imputation procedures; checking the validity of decennial data on interracial couples against an alternative federal data source; identifying tracts which should have high rates of multiracial reporting on Census 2000; and improving ethnic and racial population projections through better understanding of ethnic and racial identity formation of children of interracial couples.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,John Mark Ellis,Steven R Holloway,Margaret Hudson,Richard A Wright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

53,Completed,"Covering Kids: Evaluating Efforts to the Reduce the Number of Uninsured Children, Evidence from CHIP",UCLA,2001,2001.0,Anna Aizer,"Concern over the nearly ten million American children who lack health insurance prompted Congress to create the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Amendment.  CHIP greatly expands the number of low-income children eligible for publicly subsidized health insurance.  However, as prior experience with Medicaid (the public health insurance for poor mothers and children) has shown, eligibility does not necessarily ensure enrollment: an estimated 4.7 million children potentially eligible for Medicaid failed to enroll in 1997 (Selden, Banthin and Cohen, 1998).  In response, federal officials have mandated as part of CHIP that states develop specific strategies to overcome enrollment barriers faced by low-income populations in order to increase the proportion of children with health insurance.   Because each state has developed its own strategy for encouraging low income families to insure their children as part of the program, CHIP provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of different outreach strategies and program characteristics on enrollment in the program. 
I propose to evaluate state outreach efforts and program structure on the decision of low-income families to insure their children through private or public insurance programs, using the March Current Population Survey (CPS) annual demographic surveys for 1997-2000 and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 1996 cohort.  However, it is necessary to consider additional environmental factors (i.e. the price of medical care, physician supply and cost of providing health insurance in a particular area, as well as other labor market characteristics) that will affect family access to and choice of health insurance. These factors vary widely across and within states and therefore must be measured at the local or county level.  These factors cannot be controlled for using publicly-available CPS and SIPP data that excludes county identifiers for more than half the sample.",1,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Anna Aizer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,Completed,Efficiency of Internal Capital Markets,Boston,2002,2002.0,Antoinette Schoar,"The aim of the proposed research project is to study the workings of internal capital markets. These are of primary importance in the capital allocation process in most developed economies, where a large fraction of investment decisions are made within big corporations. On average 60-80% of any new investment in the U.S. was financed through internal capital markets. Evidently, huge amounts of funds are not allocated via market prices in external capital markets, but through allocation mechanisms within the corporate hierarchy play a major role. However, we have only very limited understanding about what determines capital allocations within companies. One area where this problem manifests itself most prominently is corporate diversification. The two most prominent ideas are that internal capital markets either lead to 'winner-picking' of segments with good investment opportunities or inefficient cross-subsidization of under-performing segments. Using plant level data on investment, we plan to analyze the workings of internal capital markets in diversified firms. The structure of the LRD data provides a unique possibility to identify investment opportunities at the individual plant level. It allows us to form several different measures of investment opportunities to study how plant and segment level capital expenditures respond to changes in these measures. Because of the unique structure of the LRD, we will be able to differentiate between investments that are made at the individual plant level and investments that involve the decision to acquire or divest a whole plant or segment. The latter are normally decided at higher levels in the firm's hierarchy. The possibility to break down investment projects this way will allow us back out whether there exists a difference in the efficiency of projects that are decided at different levels in the organizational structure. Since the LRD itself does not provide information about which plants belong to a segment, we want to match COMPUSTAT Segment data to the LRD using a crosswalk developed by a researcher. Using plant level information from the LRD will be crucial to the proposed tests in this project. First, information form the LRD will allow us to analyze more precisely the extent and direction of capital flows across segments or plants. Since publicly available information from COMPUSTAT segment information files are prone to distortions due to managerial discretion and accounting requirements, the LRD gives a much more accurate picture of the different industries and lines of business a firm operates in. This will enable us to construct much more adequate measures of the investment opportunity set at the industry level than it is possible with publicly available data. Second, a main advantage lies with the fact that the LRD allows us to distinguish investments that are made at the individual plant level from those that are decisions to buy new plants or segments. This differentiation is possible due to the unique structure of the LRD, which surveys firms at the plant level.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Sendhil Mullainathan,Antoinette Schoar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,Completed,Evaluating the Costs to Firms of the Toxics Release Inventory,Boston,2001,2004.0,Linda T Bui,"The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is part of the Community Right to Know legislation that was passed by Congress in 1986.  The TRI requires manufacturing plants to publicly report their toxic releases to the community.   Since the TRI started, reported releases have declined by more than 40%.  One difficulty in evaluating the effectiveness of TRI regulation is determining what, if anything, firms have done in response to this ""informal"" regulation.  This difficulty is compounded by the fact that (1) there are no records of toxic releases that pre-date the TRI which can be used to provide information on firm behavior prior to the regulation and (2) TRI data are self-reported by firms. We propose to focus on plant level behavior to determine how plants have responded to the TRI regulation.  In particular, we will determine whether the reductions in TRI releases are related to reductions induced by the formal regulation of other pollutants, such as the criteria air pollutants, by looking at the relationship between TRI reductions and PACE expenditures.  I also plan to investigate whether changes in plant behavior induced by TRI regulation had productivity consequences.   If TRI reductions are related to more formal regulation of other pollutants then PACE expenditures over-estimate the true costs of those regulations because they do not take into account the positive externality associated with reductions in toxic releases.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that this maybe the case.  This would also suggest that TRI regulation is being given too much credit for reductions in toxic emissions.  Furthermore, if TRI regulations caused firms to change their production processes or inputs in a fashion that changed their productivity, the costs of this regulation may differ significantly from their ""gross"" costs.  Previous research on petroleum refineries and the cost of compliance in the South Coast Air Basin suggest that there may be important productivity gains associated with environmental regulation.  Both the true costs of the TRI and the ability to use PACE data to estimate those costs cannot be determined until these questions are answered.",4,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures,PAC,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Linda T Bui,Martino Destefano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,Completed,"Explaining Home Bias in Consumption: Production Location, Magnification, and Hysteresis",Washington,2001,2001.0,Russell Hillberry,"Empirical studies of interregional trade in North America have found that trade within national borders exceeds trade across national borders by a factor of twenty.  This study proposes and tests explanations for why trade appears to be so dramatically reduced by national borders.  The chief hypothesis is that firms' location decisions endogenously create ""home bias"" in trade flows.  Additional implications of the model include magnification (measured border costs dramatically overstate true costs), hysteresis (measured border effects persist after actual costs drop to zero) and internal border effects (shipping patterns within a country exhibit discontinuities that mimic costs).  The paper suggests theoretical improvements on the standard ""gravity"" model of trade, and proposes empirical tests that can be used to assess the model, relative to the gravity model. We will use the Commodity Flow data to analyze two broad implications of this model.  One, are composition effects, ignored in the previous literature, critical for understanding measured border effects? Two, are the co-location decisions of intermediate and final goods producers the source of the composition effects?",3,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Russell Hillberry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,Completed,Evaluating and Enhancing the MEPS-IC as a Source of Policy Relevant Estimates,Washington,2001,2002.0,Jessica P Vistnes,"The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) - Insurance Component (IC) conducted by the United States Census Bureau is a key economic survey that provides important information on employer sponsored health insurance for the nation. Published results from this survey are used by the Bureau of Economic Analyses as a key input to health care costs in Gross Domestic Product. Results are also used by numerous other government agencies, including, the General Accounting Office and Treasury to support Congressional requests and assess the status and costs of employer health insurance. States also use the data as key input into their economic analyses. As a key user and sponsor of this survey, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) wishes to increase the quality and utility of this Census data. Because of the principal investigators’ unique knowledge of employer-sponsored health insurance and their econometric and statistical expertise, they have already contributed extensively to the technical aspects of the survey and to improvements in the quality of the IC data and its uses. This project should contribute to this effort to improve the survey. Among the goals of this research are the following:
• Produce estimates related to the supply and demand of employer-sponsored health insurance.
• Develop new and improved methodologies for producing such population estimates.
• Develop an understanding of the quality of data collected, through analysis of response rates, item response rates and data collection results, in order to produce changes in questionnaire structure and collection methodology that will improve collected data.

70,Completed,Using Matched Employer-Employee Data to Examine Labor Market Dynamics and the Quality of SIPP/CPS Data,UCLA,2003,2007.0,Andrew K Hildreth,"This proposal describes a project that will examine the accuracy of measurement of dynamic labor market behavior in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The key feature of the project is the use of longitudinal records from the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system and the MEDS (Medicaid Eligibility Database System) of the State of California to provide accurate information on welfare, employment, unemployment, and earnings outcomes of individuals in the Census surveys. The project will link individual records from California residents in the SIPP with UI base wage records and records from the state’s MEDS file, and use the combined data set to address a series of questions related to the welfare-to-work transition of former welfare recipients. The combined data set will also be used to examine the divergence in measures of employment and earnings derived from household surveys compared to the known events contained in administrative files. Recent initiatives at the federal level, and subsequent state welfare legislation, have focused renewed attention on the ability of existing Census survey data to track trends in program participation and measure changes in welfare-to-work. Further, at a time when the State of California has grown faster, but started at a later date than other states, there are questions over the stability of jobs that individuals leaving welfare might receive. The proposed research seeks to address a number of issues in examining economic problems relating to welfare-to-work and the construction of matched employer employee data. As well as providing evidence on important questions, there will be substantial scientific contributions from the work (that enhance and identify shortcomings in Census Chapter13, Title 5 data programs). The scientific questions to be addressed concern the representative quality of the matched data once it has been formed and a means to address issues in the Census data such as measurement error and attrition bias. This work builds the research in earlier work conducted at the CCRDC. The main purpose of this work is to use data that has already been linked by the Linked Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) project to combine this SIPP-UI linked data with another administrative data source to examine how various models perform using matched data. As part of our method, we are performing quality checks on Census data that are outside the LEHD task list and complement their data program, and the mission of the Census as a whole.",2,Medicaid Eligibility Database System - California,MED,Unemployment Insurance-Base Wage File -- California,UIW-CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Matthew E Cox,Andrew K Hildreth,Naomi Hsu,Jonathan E Schwartz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

79,Completed,What is the effect of the cultural environment on the local economy?,Triangle,2001,2002.0,Shauna M Saunders,"The aim of this research is to examine some of the key questions surrounding the effects of cultural policy.  Over the past decade, government funding for cultural institutions has undergone dramatic changes, most notably in the reductions of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding and in the shift away from federal funding to state and local funding. The consequences of these changes on cultural provision remain largely unknown. Turning to the demand side, cultural policy makers often argue that cultural projects have effects that extend beyond the audiences of the projects, and that significant spillovers to the local economy, in the form of lower crime rates, increased civic engagement, and a better citizenry generally, result. Again, most of these claims, though testable, have remained unexamined. In addition, this research on cultural policy ties into two distinct lines of ongoing research in economics, although the explicit consideration of cultural policy is novel. First, the project addresses the effects of different funding sources on the provision of public goods. Second, the project fits into the growing body of research on social interactions.",1,Census of Services,CSR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,Completed,Comparison of the Distributions of Production and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing.,Washington,2001,2001.0,Gale A Boyd,"Industrial energy demand typically involves base load consumption. As a result the industrial component of energy demand has important implications in evaluating energy infrastructure, i.e. oil, gas, electric power. There is growing concern that the energy infrastructure could be subject to both natural (e.g. storms or equipment failure) and manmade (e.g. terrorist) disruptions. To address the economic and human implications of such a disruption, planning agencies are taking a closer look at the energy infrastructure and its customers to assess its robustness and ability to continue vital functions as well as identify potential weaknesses. This project uses the LRD and MECS databases to estimate a distribution-company-level model of industrial energy demand for natural gas and electricity via a plant-level energy demand equation. An element unique to this study is the use of “establishment location” in a geographic information system (GIS) to create new, supplemental data on the relationship between the plant and the energy distribution system. These supplemental data are then used to improve the forecasting abilities of the econometric model. The benefits to the Census Bureau include 1) the creation of the GIS layers that can be used to access various data sources such as the LRD, MECS, and SSEL, in an intuitive visual mode which highlights spatial relationships, 2) the link across the LRD and MECS to create plant-level energy prices, and 3) the forecasting equations that can be used to impute non-response to energy questions in the ASM and MECS.",3,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey,MECS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While such data sources contribute to our understanding of violence, the victim contacts that are detected by these systems understate and possibly misrepresent total prevalence and incidence rates. The proposed research pursues two main objectives. First, we will use National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data to estimate the probabilities that a victim will contact the police, seek medical care, or both, conditional on individual and situational factors. Second, we will explore whether distinctive contextual features of local areas contribute to further variation in the likelihood that victims seek services. To achieve the first objective, the proposed research will rely on public-use NCVS data of assault incidents to explore the influence of various incident features on the probability of agency contacts with police, healthcare providers, or both systems. To achieve the second objective, we will estimate contextual effects by linking area-identified NCVS data with criminal justice policy and healthcare data for 48 of the largest 50 US cities. The analysis will seek to identify system features that are associated with an increased likelihood of victim/agency contacts.",1,National Crime Victimization Survey,NCVS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,Completed,A General Equilibrium Analysis of Urban Labor and Housing Markets,Boston,2002,2006.0,Stephen L Ross,"In this project, we propose to estimate an empirical model that describes the equilibrium location and employment decisions made by households and firms within a single metropolitan area. In our model, each household makes its residential location decision based on a wide variety of factors including characteristics of housing and schools, neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics, housing prices, other neighborhood amenities, and employment access. The employment of each household member is in turn influenced by his/her access to suitable jobs, neighborhood characteristics, and individual/household characteristics. Firms make decisions based on access to different types of workers, other firms, and customers, and in our most general specification a firm’s location directly influences the characteristics of its workforce. These decisions combine to create a complex spatial equilibrium, which determines land use, prices, and wages throughout the metropolitan area. We use the estimates of this model to explore complex interactions in urban labor and housing markets, focusing on two well-known questions in which the simultaneity of the household residential location and employment decisions as well as the simultaneity of household and firm location decisions have been quite evident. These questions relate to whether access to employment influences labor market outcomes, and whether the quality of a neighborhood affects labor market outcomes. We begin this proposal by describing these important research questions and the difficulties researchers have had controlling for the endogeneity problems introduced by the simultaneity of these decisions. We then describe our methodology and explain how the estimates of our model can be used to shed new light on these questions.",2,American Housing Survey,AHS,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Patrick J Bayer,Shihe N Fu,Anupam Nanda,Stephen L Ross,Victor A Shlychkov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,Completed,The Effects of Cigarette Price and Tax Increases on Decisions to Quit Smoking,Cornell,2006,2007.0,Dean R Lillard,"We propose to study determinants of decisions to quit smoking by analyzing retrospective smoking history data from the NLS Younger Women cohort.  Those data have been underutilized in research on smoking behavior.  They are interesting from a substantive point of view because the prime-child bearing ages of the women in that sample spanned important policy changes related to smoking. In particular, in 1985 the US Surgeon General required warning labels to be attached to every third cigarette package that specifically warned pregnant women about the dangers of smoking to fetuses.  We would like to include, as a major focus of our study, the cigarette taxes in each state (and potentially county) of residence.  The county identifiers will allow us to identify individuals living in high tax states but close to the border of a state with lower taxes.  Their effective cigarette price is likely to be lower if it is possible for them to shop across the state line (as is the case for residents of New York who live close to Pennsylvania). Although the project proposes to study only the behavior of the NLS Younger Women, we may extend the analysis to include the NLS Older Men and NLS Older Women. The retrospective smoking information in the NLS Original Cohorts is of particular interest because  we can match young women with mothers and fathers and control the smoking behavior of parents and because the sample periods span a very long time over which taxes changed dramatically.  Thus, we would like to attach the state (and county) identifiers to respondents in the NLS Older Men and NLS Mature Women cohorts as well.  Another advantage of the NLS surveys is that we have access to the geocode files of the NLS Youth 1979 and the NLS Youth 1997 samples.  The addition of the NLS Original Cohort geocodes will therefore allow us to analyze four decades of smoking behavior using the similarly designed NLS surveys.",1,BLS - National Longitudinal Survey (Original Cohorts Geocode),NLS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

92,Completed,California Immigrant Families and Welfare Reform,Berkeley,2002,2005.0,Henry E Brady,"This proposal is part of a larger study of the impact of welfare reform on California’s immigrant families. We propose to use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Current Population Survey (CPS) linked to two major statewide administrative data sets in California, the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS) of the California Department of Health Services and Unemployment Insurance/Disability Insurance (hereafter referred to as EDD data) of the California Employment Development Department. The linkage of these data sets will produce longitudinal files for the California sub-sample of the CPS and SIPP with detailed information on immigration status and household characteristics combined with administrative data on public assistance program participation and earnings over time. The proposed research will benefit the Census Bureau in a number of distinct ways. First, it will provide the Census Bureau with a basis to evaluate the accuracy of important self-reported measures in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), including Medicaid coverage, receipt of cash aid, Food Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This validation will be valuable for the future use of these surveys because SIPP and CPS tend to differ significantly in their estimates of participation in these important programs. Second, comparing the SIPP and CPS data on program participation with the MEDS records will allow us to investigate differences between self-reports and administrative records for the two same individuals due to characteristics of the surveys, such as reference time periods and question wording, which are linked to the inaccuracies of survey respondents’ self reports. Third, the match of EDD records with CPS and SIPP records will provide us with estimates of the direction and size of errors in reported earnings in the surveys. Fourth, this match will enable us to examine more closely the differences in poverty measures and rates using the CPS and SIPP by comparing the two surveys to administrative wage records and public assistance use. Fifth, using the administrative data we will evaluate the Survey of Population Dynamics (SPD) for its ability to track the use of welfare programs.

The two related models, sponsored by the Office of Aging, Disability and Long Term Care Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), Department of Health and Human Services and maintained by The Lewin Group, are entitled the Pension and Retirement Income Simulation Model (PRISM) and the Long-Term Care Financing Model (LTCFM). This data set would replace the existing input dataset which is based on the last available public-use CPS and SSA earnings histories match of the March 1978 CPS. We propose to run the first stage of the model described below at Census facilities. We propose to be allowed to remove the output of the PRISM from the Census facilities because it will contain no original information that was not available from the public use files. Specifically, the earnings histories that will be used to project future social security income would not be retained in the output database. This output data could then be tabulated and also would be used as input data to the LTCFM.
The PRISM and LTCFM are used by ASPE to examine retirement and health care policy issues under consideration by the Congress and the White House. PRISM is a dynamic microsimulation model designed to simulate the retirement income of the elderly (age 65 and older) population. It ages the input database annually from 1979 through 2040, aligning aggregate outcomes to the projections of the Social Security Trustees report. Users of PRISM can simulate changes in laws and regulations related to pensions and social security, as well as modify economic and demographic assumptions. The Long-Term Care Financing Model (LTCFM) simulates nursing home and home care use and expenditures for individuals ages 65 and older to the year 2030. It permits analyses of alternative assumptions about the nature of the elderly population in the future (e.g., declining disability rates) and policy scenarios (e.g., tax incentives for long-term care insurance or changes to Medicaid eligibility).",1,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,Completed,BR98-10  The Causes and Consequences of Job Destruction,Boston,1998,1998.0,Robert K Triest,"Our proposed project is an extension of ongoing research on job creation and destruction in U.S. manufacturing summarized in Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996).  A central finding of this research is the prominent role of job destruction in business cycle fluctuations.  Specifically, job destruction increases sharply and regularly in recessions, but job creation typically declines much less and by varying amounts across recessions.  Together, these features imply that job reallocation rises significantly during recessions. 
	Although the Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (DHS) results provide a fascinating look at what happens to job destruction -- i.e., how large it is, how much it varies, how long it lasts, in which kind of plants it occurs, etc. -- very little is known yet about why job destruction happens.  Thus, the goal of this research proposal is to discover what causes job destruction and, in doing so, delineate the causes from the consequences of  job destruction.  Initially, this research will follow the tradition of DHS, which is a largely descriptive empirical analysis of the data.

When firms compete over time, they have more potential profit-maximizing strategies at their disposal.  For example, in markets where sunk entry costs are high, firms may overinvest in initial capacity to deter subsequent entry.  If additional firms fail to enter the market as a result, the incumbent can maintain its market power over time.  Similarly, where there is uncertainty about the profitability of entry opportunities, potential entrants may learn about markets by looking at the prices existing firms charge.  An incumbent might charge a lower than optimal price in early periods to signal to potential entrants that profits in this market would be low.  Such strategies involve firms bearing costs initially (through high set-up costs or sub-optimal profits), but enjoying excess profits through market power in several subsequent years.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in information technology have the potential to affect firms   location in many ways: with new technologies, a firm might find that it no longer needs to be in cities, or it might no longer need to be near rural clients; a firm might decide to disperse its operations over several distant sites, or it might decide to consolidate in one location. The goal of this research is to determine what kind of places   the central cities of large metropolitan areas, suburbs of large metropolitan areas, smaller metropolitan areas, small towns, or rural areas, for instance   are benefiting from firms   adoption of information technology. 
By linking county-level data on changes in firm location with industry-level data on information technology usage, this research will distinguish which of the popular notions about technology and cities is accurate. The methodology for this study consists of local industry growth regressions. The dependent variable is the employment change over time in local industry (that is, an industry-county cell). The independent variable of interest is the interaction between information technology usage and location characteristics, like metropolitan area size and county density. The coefficients on these interaction terms will identify whether information technology favors employment shifts to big cities, smaller cities, suburbs, or rural areas. 
The success of this research depends on the quality of the firm location data. The most appropriate firm location data for this study is the Longitudinal Enterprise and Establishment Microdata (LEEM) file. The LEEM file has the advantages of tracking individual establishments over time; of identifying the firm that an establishment belongs to; of providing exact employment counts instead of estimates; and of covering all sectors including services, which is the sector most likely to be affected by advances in information technology.

139,Completed,WO99-09  Specialization of Cities,Washington,1999,2000.0,Thomas J Holmes,"Recently, there has been great interest in theories that place the geographic distribution of demand front and center in accounting for the geographic distribution of economic activity.   One implication of this theory that has received attention in the empirical literature is the home-market effect; i.e., that an increase in demand should be followed by an increase in production that exceeds the increase in demand (a slope greater than one).   However, the existing literature has not taken into account problems that arise when product differentiation is important and data is aggregated across differentiated products.  In this case, the relationship between production and local demand should be convex and the slope will be greater than one only when evaluated at high levels of demand.
The proposed project will use data from the Census of  Wholesale trade  to examine the relationship between wholesale activity and local demand as proxied by population.   The project will examine the extent to which the relationship is convex and whether the slope is relatively steep when evaluated at high levels of demand, as predicted by the theory.  The paper will also examine whether the convexity in the relationship for aggregate-level industries emerges from the aggregation of narrowly-defined industries, as predicted by the theory.",1,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,Completed,The Impact of Violence on Neighborhood Business Activity,CMU,2002,2002.0,Robert T Greenbaum,"The proposed research will investigate the impact of violence on non-victims. We will combine geo-coded homicide data from six cities over ten years with a longitudinal data set containing all business establishments in these cities to determine whether localized surges in homicide activity have an impact on neighborhood business districts. If, after controlling for prior trends in business activity, homicide surges are followed by closings of retail and personal services business establishments, this will provide empirical evidence that non-victims, such as customers and employees, are changing their behavior and thereby incurring a cost from increases in violence. The proposed research will provide a number of significant benefits to the Census Bureau. Because the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) is a new data set, the project will provide the Bureau with an early assessment of the quality of the data. The study utilizes temporal and spatial aspects of the data, thus allowing for tests of the stability of the data across both dimensions. For the six cities, the research will hopes to provide important improvements to the geocoding of the existing LBD data by creating a stable set of ZIP groups, which will be created by accounting for the changes the U.S. Postal Service makes in ZIP codes over time. A bridge file linking old ZIP boundaries to new ones in order to create a stable list of ZIPs will be given to CES to aid to future researchers. Finally, the proposed research will provide new insights into the relationship between neighborhood job growth and violence that will assist federal, state and local decision makers in designing practices and allocating resources to improve the quality of life in urban areas. By helping to provide additional information about the interactions between residents and the characteristics of the local business community, we will help provide richer measures of the census variables.",1,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

150,Completed,"The Effects of Spatial Accessibility On Employment and Wages by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex",UCLA,2001,2002.0,Virginia L Parks,"This research addresses the crucial question of how spatial unevenness in the distribution of jobs and workers contributes to labor market inequality. Specifically, this research measures the effect of spatial accessibility on the probability of employment and on wages for different racial and ethnic groups, as well as by sex.  Proponents of the spatial mismatch hypothesis invoke spatial accessibility as a root cause of the racial gap in employment between blacks and whites.  Spatial accessibility—or inaccessibility—also has been used as an explanation for the gender-gap in wages by the spatial entrapment hypothesis. Considerable debate surrounds these two hypotheses, primarily as a result of widely different methodological approaches given limited data on job location. This research empirically tests the implications of spatial accessibility for different race and gender groups using individual-level data that includes tract of work information. Such data allows a robust test of spatial accessibility while controlling for important individual characteristics, such as human capital. The analysis consists of two parts. First, this study considers the effects of residential location relative to jobs on employment. Specifying a logit model that includes a measure of spatial accessibility to jobs matched to an individual’s skills as an independent variable provides a measure of the effect of residential location relative to jobs on the probability of employment. Second, this research examines the effect of residential location relative to jobs on wages. Regressing wages on a set of variables that includes a measure of spatial accessibility tests the wage effect of spatial job accessibility. The proposed research contributes to debates about the role residential and job location play in labor market inequality by measuring the effect of spatial accessibility on employment and wages using the one-in-six sample of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. Examination of this data allows analysis of the spatial pattern of allocation/imputation of tract of work data based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, industry, and occupation, as well as the potential documentation of new allocation methods.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,Completed,Welfare Reform and Migration:  Moving to Benefits/Moving from Restrictions?,Washington,2007,2011.0,Deborah R Graefe," 
Has devolution of welfare policy based on the 1996 welfare reform act created “welfare magnet” states where state policies provide more generous benefits and lenient participation requirements? Have welfare disincentive states with more restrictive policies resulted in increased intrastate adjustment moves and outmigration of welfare poor families? Does welfare-driven migration result in increased after-move wellbeing compared with before the move for welfare poor families versus nonmigrant families? This study uses merged data from four sources—the 1996 and 2001 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Urban Institute’s Welfare Rules Database, and a local labor market characteristics file created from decennial census and Current Population Survey data—in a longitudinal, two-stage specification of welfare-benefit “push” and “pull” impacts on poor families’ migration behavior. Based upon a state welfare policy inequality framework, we use factor analysis to develop measures from textual policy manual materials to operationalize 10 welfare benefit and eligibility rule dimensions for the post-1996 welfare reform implementation period and use these measures to test hypothesized state program effects on migration. We use discrete-time event history analysis to predict migration events (interstate or intrastate migration) in the SIPP data. Our hierarchical modeling strategy considers an integrated, and previously untested, micro-macro analysis of three determinant-of-migration hypotheses for welfare poor families. These tests evaluate effects of 1) time-varying state welfare policy characteristics; 2) individual and family characteristics, including detailed migration, work, and welfare participation histories and network ties, from the information-rich SIPP files; and 3) local labor market-level economic opportunity structure indicators. Following Frey et al. (1996), we separately analyze push and pull migration effects of our hypothesized covariates through, first, a “destination model” for identifying pull effects and then, a “departure model,” which identifies push effects for potential migrants’ origin locations. The combination of destination and departure model vectors for state welfare policy, local labor market, and individual and household indicators will provide a strong test, giving new evidence on the “salience of benefit variation to subjects” thesis (Shram and Voss 1999) regarding the welfare policy impact on migration. Finally, we model post-move family income, welfare benefits, and participation requirements as well-being outcomes of welfare poor migrants versus nonmigrants using time-ordered additive and interactive OLS regression models. The proposed work is expected 1) to provide estimates of migration among the welfare poor; 2) to improve understanding the quality of data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau through efforts to understand migration-related reasons for loss to sample; 3) to result in enhancement of the data collected by the Census Bureau by addition of state-level policy data and local labor market indicators for the 1996 through 2002 period, providing for the development of links across both time and entities for these data; and 4) to demonstrate to the demographic community the value of the SIPP for studying migration and other migration-related phenomena, since the Census Bureau has undertaken efforts with the most recent data collections to improve its quality for this purpose.",1,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project involves two components: 1) regression analysis of the employment impacts of international trade on rural counties and 2) regression analysis of the impacts of international trade on wages and income inequality within and across rural counties. The project will utilize 4-digit industrial shipment and foreign export shipment data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). The LRD data will be aggregated to the county-level and will be linked with 4-digit international import and export data and exchange rate data to create a unique, county-level, international export and import exchange rate dataset. This new dataset will be used to estimate via regression modeling the county-level employment, income and wage effects of changing patterns of international trade between 1972 and 1997. The employment and wage models will also utilize LRD data on average, production, and nonproduction worker manufacturing employment wages. Other data for the project will come from publicly available sources including the Regional Economic Information Systems (REIS) data series and the Census of Population. Improved understanding of the quality of census data will be accomplished through analysis of the 1997 export estimates. These estimates, which have not yet been evaluated in comparison to prior census years, will be compared to export measures in the 1987 and 1992 Economic Censuses.

158,Completed,Oil and Gas Involved Areas Along the U.S. Gulf Coast,Washington,2002,2004.0,John J Beggs,"The research we propose in this project centers on the definition of oil and gas involved areas along the coast of Gulf of Mexico. Previous research has necessarily relied on publicly available data sources such as household census PUMS (public-use microdata samples) files, (STF files) summary tape files, economic censuses, and County Business Patterns data. For public data of this sort, geographic specificity is a serious concern.  In the case of Gulf of Mexico oil and gas involvement, delineations have been based on counties (parishes).  Coastal counties and parishes can be quite large in land area.  As such, county-based involvement schema can be less than precise.  The internal files available to us at the Census Bureau are the microdata (household-level and establishment-level) which underlie the public-use data that are widely published.  The internal microdata code residential geography to the block level (population censuses) and the tract level (economic censuses). Place of work geography is coded to the tract level as well.  As such, we are in position to specify with geographic precision those land areas along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico that exhibit significant involvement in the oil and gas industries.

163,Completed,Longitudinal Analysis of the Earnings and Food Stamp Participation of the Working Poor,Washington,2005,2006.0,Mary E Farrell,"We will address the following research questions on the relationship between the long-term earnings patterns of the working poor who are eligible for the food stamp program (FSP) and their participation in the program: 
• How do the historical earnings patterns of the 1996 cohort of participants and eligible nonparticipants among the working poor differ, and what are the explanations for any differences? 
• To what extent are historical and future earnings patterns predictive of participation in the FSP for the 1996 cohort, given individual characteristics and state welfare policies? 
• To what extent do historical earnings of the 1996 cohort predict future earnings, and how is that related to FSP participation? 
• How do the earnings patterns of the 1996 cohort compare to an earlier cohort from 1992? 
A major concern among policy makers is that a significant number of eligible households, especially the working poor, do not participate in the program. One study found that only 46 percent of working FSP eligible households participated in the program in 1994, compared to an aggregate rate of 69 percent for all FSP eligible households. Some argue that these low participation rates might be an indication that the FSP is not fulfilling its primary purpose of providing food assistance to all who need it. Another explanation is that these households are eligible for a short period of time and anticipate an increase in their earnings. 
We would like to use restricted research files of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to the Social Security Administration’s Summary Earnings Records (SER) to identify long-term earnings patterns of the working poor. To date, there is very limited information on the historical earnings patterns of these groups, primarily because of data limitations. The matched SIPP/SER data address this limitation by providing complete earnings histories for nationally representative samples, including large samples of the working poor. Hence, our analysis will provide the first comprehensive analysis of long-term earnings patterns of the working poor. In addition, this study will provide the USDA with important information regarding the reliability of the participation estimates it obtains from the SIPP. The accuracy of the number of eligible persons is based, in part, on the accuracy of the earnings estimates. This is an important concern, as the share of food stamp recipients who are working has been growing in recent years. It might be, for instance, that many working poor households that appear eligible for the FSP based on SIPP data, but say they do not participate, are really ineligible because their earnings are higher than what they report. Our study will examine the accuracy of the earnings data in the SIPP core files, as well as the validity and usefulness of the employment information in the SIPP’s employment history topical module. 
We are interested in the entire history of earnings because for policy reasons it is important to understand how longer-term earnings patterns for adults in working poor families are related to participation in the FSP. The SIPP can support limited analysis of this issue through use of self-reported income over the panel period and some very limited information that is captured in an employment history module. We would like to use the matched data to assess whether better information about past or expected future earnings would improve our understanding of food stamp participation. In summary, this study will provide a better understanding of (1) who under-reports or overreports earnings and employment on the SIPP; (2) how the underreporting or overreporting affects findings on the working poor population and the take-up rates of the FSP; and (3) whether individuals reporting employment on the employment history topical module are able to recall past jobs.",2,Survey of Income and Program Participation - Longitudinal,SIP-LON,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Samuel M Elkin,Matthew Langley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,Completed,The Impact of Workplace and Technological Innovations on the Demand for Less-Skilled Labor: A Study of Three Industries,Berkeley,2003,2005.0,Ann P Bartel,"There is evidence that firms require more skilled labor on the production line, production workers’ education levels are rising, and income inequality is growing, with higher returns to education even within production worker categories. An increase in skill demand may well arise from the greater computerization or technological improvements that are taking place within manufacturing. Greater skill demand may also arise from the adoption of more innovative human resource practices that put greater decision-making power in the hands of production workers. More specifically, as information technologies put more information in the hands of production workers, they are more likely to require greater reading, math, and problem-solving skills to make use of that information. In this project, we propose to test the hypothesis that greater levels of information technology, increased technological improvements, and innovative HR practices have elevated the skill requirements for production workers. This hypothesis will be tested using data from three industries—steel, fabricated metals, and medical instruments. We propose to undertake our own surveys of plants in these industries to gather data on the types of computerization or information technologies, the use of specific production technologies, human resource practices and skill requirements. The questions on these surveys will be specific to each industry. These data will be matched with data on wages, employment and value added from the LRD in order to build a panel data set of plant level practices and outcomes.
We propose to do regression analysis of the effects of new technologies on a number of different dependent variables: the average wage level; the wage ratio for production versus nonproduction employees; the number of production versus non-production employees; and measures of the types of skills demanded (from our own surveys). The results should provide insights into the types of skills and training that are required in manufacturing today, and the impact on wages, all arising from technological changes. The analysis of new industry-specific technologies and innovative HRM practices will contribute to the literature in several important ways. First, while many studies suggest that new computer-based technologies have contributed to the demand for more skilled workers, the measures of technology used in existing studies are not persuasive because they are not specific to individual industries and plants. Here, we propose to measure actual technological advances in three industries and examine how the skill requirements of plants that adopt these technologies differ from the skill requirements of plants without these technologies. Second, despite claims that new HRM practices that promote more employee participation require a different kind of worker, no existing study examines the impact of work practice innovations that have emerged in American industry in the last twenty years on workers’ skill requirements. Using the resulting matched data set, we will find out whether network use within plants, as measured by the ASM supplement, is correlated with other technological improvements on the production line. These matched surveys would enhance the Census Bureau’s knowledge of these manufacturing industries and evaluate the quality of the new data collected by the Computer Network supplement. Additionally, the methodology developed by this project for linking supplemental datasets in a panel format will provide an illustration of how these data series can be linked and then used to conduct similar research in other manufacturing areas, thereby extending the usefulness of the LRD. This project will determine whether there are industry differences in the way plants interpret and answer the network use questions included on the ASM Computer Network Use supplement, and thus suggest whether future adjustments to these questions are necessary. This research will allow us to assess whether our technology questions might be considered valuable in a future ASM surveys— surveys such as the industry-specific supplements or the Computer Network Use supplement.

183,Completed,Specialization and Organization in Legal Services,Chicago,2002,2004.0,Thomas Hubbard,"Since Adam Smith’s famous ‘pin factory’ fable, economists have been preoccupied with the role that specialization and the division of labor play in economic growth. Surprisingly, however, this recognition of the fundamental impact that specialization plays in economic growth has not led to much systematic empirical work on the organization of specialization. In fact, no systematic empirical work has illuminated such questions as: When do individuals specialize and how does this relate to the complexity of activities? When do specialists work within the same firm, and when do they work in different firms? When is specialization limited by the extent of the market, and when and why is it limited by other factors such as coordination costs? What role do hierarchies play in facilitating specialization? What accounts for differences in hierarchical forms; for example, when do hierarchies tend to be steep versus flat? Empirical evidence on these and other related questions is important for understanding a wide range of issues in industrial organization and labor economics. We propose to use microdata from the legal services portion of the Census of Services to investigate these and other related questions. These data contain firm-level information about the specialties of lawyers and the number of individuals who are partners, associate lawyers, paralegals, and non-legal staff. These data provide a unique opportunity to investigate specialization and hierarchies within professional service firms, and would allow us to study questions such as those described above in an ideal context. Our project would provide a wide array of benefits to the Census Bureau. First, it would aid in understanding and improving the quality of Census of Services data. To our knowledge, no one at CES has worked with the Legal Services microdata. As we put the data into shape and conduct analysis, we will learn better the strengths and weaknesses of the data, which will allow Census staff to revise and improve the existing survey and indicate what other survey questions would generate good data about the organization and growth of this and other professional service industries. Second, it would potentially lead to a new or improved methodology to collect, measure, and tabulate data in professional service industries. Current definitions of the firm used by Census are based on the common ownership and control of physical assets; it is difficult to apply these definitions in contexts such as professional services, where physical assets are not necessarily important. By testing new theories of firms' boundaries that do not revolve around physical assets, we will examine whether new criteria for professional service firms' boundaries should be introduced. This is particularly important in light of the general movement away from manufacturing and toward services in the U.S. economy. Third, it would identify shortcomings of current data collection programs and document new data collection needs by providing evidence regarding the extent and incidence of temporary worker use in different segments of the legal services industry. This would help Census staff develop ways of accounting for such workers in this and other sectors by guiding it to the segments where they are most prevalent. Fourth, in the longer term, our project would be the first step toward enhancing Census' existing legal services data. It may be possible to create a matched worker-establishment database for this industry by merging the data from the Census of Services with that from the Martindale-Hubbell law directories.",4,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Services,CSR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
188,Completed,"Family Resources, Race, and Small Business Outcomes",Washington,2002,2003.0,Robert W Fairlie,"The high failure rates, low profits, and small employment sizes of black- and Hispanic-owned businesses, relative to their white and Asian counterparts, are of concern to many policy makers.  To date, we do not fully understand why black- and Hispanic-owned firms lag behind white and Asian-owned firms.  In the proposed research project, I will use data from the Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) to explore the role that intergenerational links in self-employment play in contributing to racial differences in small business outcomes, such as failures, sales, profits, and employment size.  A careful examination of how family business experience differs by race and ethnicity may uncover some answers.  The inability of blacks and Hispanics to acquire business experience may be at the root of their limited success in business ownership.  Furthermore, family-owned businesses have historically provided a route out of poverty and into long-term, sometimes intergenerational, self-sufficiency for many families.  A better understanding of this process may shed light on why some families are not successful in their small businesses.",1,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
189,Completed,"Location, growth, and productivity in the manufacturing and service sectors",Boston,2002,2005.0,Vernon Henderson,"This proposal has four interrelated parts, which use Census Bureau establishment level data for the manufacturing, headquarters, and business, professional, and financial service sectors. The first part that applies throughout examines the utility of these Census data by evaluating both their quality and their ability to characterize potentially important developments in these sectors. The other three parts deal with the specifics of the economic investigations using these data. What are these investigations? Certain service and headquarters activities locate disproportionately in the largest metro areas, while manufacturing is found disproportionately in smaller towns and cities. Broadly defined business services have twice the share of employment in the largest metro areas as they do in the smallest cities, while for manufacturing it is the other way around. The question is why; and, hence, what is the role of large metro areas versus small and medium size cities in a country. To start to understand the forces at work, we need to examine at a micro level the local growth patterns, productivity, and outsourcing decisions in these industries. Urban agglomeration is determined primarily by two related forces. First are local scale externalities from information spillovers and labor market operations, whether internal to an industry or deriving from the overall scale of the local urban environment. Second are the benefits to local firms from local linkages in input and output markets. To what extent are headquarters in metro areas to take advantage of the diversity of local intermediate service inputs, as opposed to gather information about innovations, export markets, financing, and the like through local information spillovers from, say, other headquarters? Similarly, why are services located in the largest and most expensive metro areas? To what extent is it local scale externalities within the service sector, versus upstream and downstream linkages within the service sector, versus linkages to sectors using services (e.g., headquarters) where those sectors may experience high own-sector scale externalities? The first two sections of the proposal examine these issues through a detailed analysis of city growth of headquarters and service industries, out-sourcing decisions, and productivity of headquarters and service sector firms. A variety of questions are explored econometrically. The third section of the proposal looks at the determinants of industry mobility across cities. The fourth section of the proposal illustrates issues concerning the utility of the data that this work will examine in the course of data preparation and analysis. The proposal involves the use of the Longitudinal Research Data [LRD] for manufacturing, the Company Auxiliary Organization [CAO] and the Large Company Survey [ES-9100] for headquarters and firms, the Standard Statistical Establishment List [SSEL] and the time linked version of that [LBD] for service sector establishments, and the Assets and Expenditures Survey [AES] for service establishment material, service, and capital inputs (including computers). The CAO and ES-9100 have been rarely used in the past; the LBD has just been constructed to link establishments over time; and the AES has never been used by academic researchers. The project will benefit Census Bureau programs in understanding the quality of data produced through Census surveys, as well as identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs. The part of the project which employs location information (in the LRD, CAO, and AES) to examine plant location and mobility across geographic areas will help identify strengths and weaknesses of current geo-coding operations. It will reveal trends in industrial location that the Census Bureau should be aware of in its future collection activities. The service-outsourcing component of the project is the first systematic look at the importance of collecting (or not collecting) this kind of cost data. Expenditure questions for business services such as legal and accounting were only first asked in the 1992 ASM. The project will help understand if these costs are a significant proportion of total production costs for plants, headquarters and firms in the AES, CAO, ES-9100, and Annual Survey of Manufactures [ASM] and how such costs vary across service and manufacturing sectors of the economy. The analysis will reveal which categories of purchased services are most important items for data collection in different surveys. It will also reveal whether questions about out-sourcing in categories such as repair services are properly constructed or whether more questions about intrafirm relations and exchange of services would be helpful in either the CAO, ES-9100, or plant surveys. The project will investigate headquarters and service industry survey responses that in general have been little explored by researchers and analysts beyond the basic Title 13 reporting activity conducted by Census. This work parallels the extensive expansion of the service sector surveys currently underway within the Census Economic Survey programs. Given how dynamic these sectors of the economy are, the analysis of this project will help provide important input to the evaluation and anticipation of the changes occurring in these sectors and their impact on survey execution. Opportunities can be uncovered for question clarification to improve the accuracy of the information reported by survey respondents. For example, does the AES include all the key pieces of information on the economic behavior of large service firms, are certain questions ill-designed to induce the desired correct response, or are some questions irrelevant? How useful for economic analyses are the individual industry Census of Services questionnaires and well do they integrate into the AES for analysis? The scope of the project includes many data sets. By linking the data sets together by firm, it is possible to identify the extent to which the establishments and firms match up over the surveys. Because each are the result of different survey processes, the linking will help clarify coverage of multiestablishment firms’ activity and information gathered. Is there organizational complexity that is not currently being correctly captured by the surveys? Can we infer new information by combining the surveys? For example, is there additional detail on the functions of auxiliary establishments that can be uncovered using the industry classifications of other operating units in the same firm? Do outsourcing expenditures for, say, legal services for establishments across the surveys add up to the totals reported for the firm? If not, can the differences be identified and understood? Are differences expected or problematic, and if so what can be done to improve coverage?",9,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Services,CSR,Enterprise Summary Report - ES9100 (large company),ESR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Mohammad Arzaghi,James C Davis,Vernon Henderson,Yukako Ono,Hyoung gun Wang,Masaki Yamada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

194,Completed,Community Variation in Victim Crime Reporting: A Multilevel Analysis Using Data from the Area-Identified NCVS,Chicago,2001,2003.0,Eric P Baumer,"Although it has been well documented that a substantial portion of all crime experienced by citizens in the U.S. is not reported to the police, very few studies have systematically examined whether residents of certain types of communities are more, or less, likely to report crime victimizations to the police. This issue has not been addressed extensively largely because the data needed to do so—data on victims of crime and on the communities in which they reside—traditionally have not been available to researchers. If approved by the Census Bureau, the proposed research will use data from the 1995-2001 Area-Identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), linked with data from the Sample Survey of Law Enforcement Agencies (SSLEA), the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, and census data on tracts and places to investigate the effects of several characteristics of communities on the likelihood of police notification by crime victims. The community characteristics considered will include neighborhood features such as socioeconomic disadvantage, minority concentration, immigrant concentration, and residential instability, and place-level indicators such as the degree of local police involvement in community policing activities and the racial composition of the local police agency. The proposed research contributes significantly to the literature on victim crime reporting, and the analyses have important implications for macro-level research and theory tests which often assume little or no systematic variation in crime reporting across communities. In addition, the research will benefit the Census Bureau by adding contextual data to the NCVS, evaluating and improving the usefulness of the NCVS, using methodologies (e.g., survey regression techniques, multilevel modeling) that will enhance understanding of these data, and highlighting the value of the NCVS for cutting-edge theoretical and relevant research.",1,National Crime Victimization Survey,NCVS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
195,Completed,The Impact of Welfare Reform on Female Headship Decisions: A Supplementary Data Request,Boston,2002,2004.0,John M Fitzgerald,"In the 1990s many states adopted reforms to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the largest cash welfare program in the U.S. While much of the focus of these reforms has been on moving recipients from welfare to work, many reforms were also directed at affecting demographic decisions. Welfare reform hopes to reduce the incidence of non-marital fertility and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Our ongoing project examines whether the reform provisions initiated as state waivers—and in some cases incorporated into the national legislation—deterred women from becoming and remaining unmarried mothers. Our specific aims in the project are to model female headship decisions (unmarried motherhood) and assess the impact of welfare reform provisions on those decisions while controlling for local economic conditions. So far, we have used data from the 1990,92,93 SIPP linked by respondent’s residence to state policy variables and county labor market variables to estimate models of female headship and transitions into and out of female headship. We use confidential geography for county of residence to help separate labor market effects from state policy effects. Results to date indicate that waivers appear to have effects, but further work is needed to understand the mechanism at work.

I will use two main approaches. First, I will follow Bound (1989) using a more current dataset, with more complete information on rejected SSDI applicants. This technique will produce a more precise upper bound on the elasticity of SSDI participation. Second, in addition to providing an upper bound, I will adopt a quasi-experimental approach to provide a point estimate of the impact for an important sub-sample of applicants: those whose eligibility is based in part on vocational factors. More specifically, with data on rejected as well as accepted SSDI applicants, I will be able to exploit the idiosyncrasies of the Social Security Administration’s Disability Determination Process. I will be able to show that the SSDI participation rule fits within a quasi-experimental design framework that has recently gained significant attention in the economics literature: the Regression Discontinuity Design. The data that will be used are the 1990-1996 panels of SIPP exact matched to the Social Security Disability Determination 831 file. Creation of this new dataset will enhance the reach of the SIPP data in three ways. First, by matching the SIPP to Social Security data, I will obtain a more accurate measure of SSDI participation than available in the SIPP. Second, I will be to study the accuracy of and relationships between self-reported SSDI benefit receipt, health measures and disability status in the SIPP.

222,Completed,"Firm Organization, Internal Capital Markets and Merger and Acquisition Activity",Washington,2003,2006.0,Gordon M Phillips,"Our planned research centers on the question on how producers with different organizational structures react to long-term shifts in industry demand. Several recent papers have analyzed the failure rates of firms in industries, and have related the clustering of firm exits to stages in an industry’s evolution ((Gort and Klepper (1982), Jovanovic (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990), Klepper (1996). Not much is known about how a producer’s organizational form affects its reaction to industry shocks and how it predicts the redeployment of productive assets in the next stage of the industry’s evolution. In particular, it may be that the advantage of belonging to a larger organization and having access to internal capital markets is particularly significant at times when industry-level cost or demand shifts. We therefore focus on examining the relation between the organizational forms of firms and the long-run characteristics of the industries in which they operate, and on how these factors affect acquisition and survival probabilities of firms. The project will examine relationships among the firm identifiers, industry classification, and accounting information in the Census Bureau’s Census of Manufacturers (CM), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), and COMPUSTAT. Using recently developed links between COMPUSTAT and the CES data, we will be able to assess the relative importance of public and private firms in the Census Bureau’s various surveys. Public firms can raise capital by issuing securities publicly to a broad class of investors and may be a larger source of growth for the economy and thus more should be known about these firms. Specific substitutive insights about the quality of the Census Bureau’s economic surveys we can provide in this area include the amount of sales at the firm level are distributed between manufacturing and non-manufacturing, and how much investment takes place at the divisional level outside of manufacturing. We will be enhancing the Census of Manufactures data with the financial data from COMPUSTAT. We will provide information from our study that will help the Census Bureau improve the sampling frame for the ASM by comparing the sample of establishments that is in the CM and ASM and the set of publicly traded firms from COMPUSTAT and by assessing the relative sampling weights of private vs. public firms on COMPUSTAT. We estimate how firm financial resources (data from COMPUSTAT) affect firm’s real business decisions (data obtained from the CM and ASM), such as investment, acquisitions, and mergers. Using the links provided between COMPUSTAT & the LRD data we can thus study the interactions between financial structure and financing patterns and firms real decisions (technology adoption, investment, mergers) and thus increase information that the Census Bureau can provide without the budget cost of a new or expanded survey or census, and without increasing respondent burden. We can aid the Census Bureau by examining whether ASM establishments are being sampled at the appropriate weights given criteria of sampling both representative public and private firms. We can see what fraction of COMPUSTAT small firms are currently being sampled in the ASM and compare it to the fraction of non-COMPUSTAT firms that are being sampled.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate data extraction and to make time-series analysis easier, we plan to harmonize the data.  We also hope to develop an interface that will allow special tabulations and data extraction to be automated.

237,Completed,Do Spin-offs and Carve-outs Discipline Firm Management? Empirical Evidence.,Boston,2002,2003.0,Debarshi K Nandy,"We propose to study the impact of different forms of corporate restructuring on the labor market decisions, R&D activities, capital structure, and productivity of the firm and its establishments. We specifically consider spin-offs and equity carve-outs. Recently, the theoretical literature has argued that spin-offs and carve-outs have a disciplining effect on firm management. This literature has shown that restructuring increases the probability of a takeover of firms undergoing spin-offs and carve-outs by rival firms with better management ability, thus disciplining management and lowering managerial discretion. If managerial discretion decreases in this manner, we expect that the labor market decisions and R&D activities of the firm would be adversely affected following such restructuring. Establishments undergoing such restructuring will have poor productivity prior to the restructuring, with productivity improving after restructuring. This study proposes to test these hypotheses by comparing wages, employment, productivity, R&D activities, and capital structure of these establishments both before and after the restructuring to a control group of establishments that have not undergone such restructuring. Moreover we attempt to distinguish between the effects of such corporate restructuring on production and non-production workers. Our proposed study directly benefits the Census Bureau’s data by precisely identifying two types of corporate restructuring events, namely spin-offs and equity carveouts. We propose to identify all establishments of manufacturing firms, which had a spin-off or a carveout, by linking up the LRD and OCD with other databases, such as CRSP, Compustat, and SDC, which provide information on such restructuring events. This will help in correctly identifying the type of ownership change and thus enhance the quality of the LRD data. Our study will also help in better identifying establishments over time in a way that correctly treats the transfer of ownership and control. By linking up the SDC to the LRD, our study will help to remove possible inconsistencies related to ownership changes of establishments in the LRD data. The aim of our analysis is to provide a complete picture of the effects of corporate restructuring on the productivity of a firm, and on the employment and wages of the entire hierarchy of the firm: from executives, and central office employees, to both white and blue-collar plant level employees.",7,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Enterprise Summary Report - ES9100 (large company),ESR,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Shan N He,Debarshi K Nandy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
244,Completed,Variation in Export Activity Across U.S. Manufacturing Establishments,Washington,2003,2004.0,Charles I Mead,"This project examines whether the coverage of exports in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) systematically changes over the period of 1993-98. It does so by performing three tasks. First, it creates annual estimates of the total value of exports from the data collected in the ASM and compares these estimates over time to related statistics in the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT990) series. Second, it performs the same type of comparisons for industries in which it is believed that the quality of related FT990 estimates has declined over the period of the study. Third, it uses the ASM data to examine whether there are systematic differences in export-growth rates across different types of manufacturing establishments. Particular attention is paid to an assessment of whether the quality of the ASM data is such that it can reasonably be used to shed light on the quality of the estimates provided in the FT990 series.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
246,Completed,Diversification discount or premium? New evidence from BITS establishment-level data,Boston,2002,2003.0,Belen Villalonga,"This project will accomplish two research objectives. First, it will revise a paper produced as part of the earlier project “Corporate Diversification and Quasi-Diversification: Causes and Consequences” (LA 99-05). The paper examines whether the finding of a diversification discount in U.S. stock markets is only an artifact of the use of Compustat segment data. Using a common methodological approach on a sample of firms which exhibit a diversification discount according to segment data, it finds that, when BITS data are used, diversified firms actually trade at a significant average premium. The second research objective of this project is to revise and conclude the author’s earlier efforts to match establishment-level data from the Census Bureau’s Business Information Tracking Series (BITS) to firm-level data from Standard and Poor’s Compustat. The resulting database provides information on the financial characteristics of public U.S. firms and a more objective and detailed breakdown of their activities by industry than that offered by segment-level data. The merged database is therefore an extremely rich source of information that can be used to investigate a variety of topics. The author will be making available to the Center for Economic Studies the matching file that will enable future researchers at the Center to recreate the merged dataset, together with a document that will describe in detail the process followed to create that matching file.",1,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Belen Villalonga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
247,Completed,Regulating Pollution Through Information Disclosure:  Facility Response to the Toxics Release Inventory,Triangle,2004,2007.0,Lori S Bennear,"There is increasing interest in the United States and other countries in the use of information disclosure programs as potential substitutes for, or complements to, conventional command-and control or market-based environmental policy instruments. Much of this interest can be attributed to the apparent success of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program, which requires large manufacturing facilities to report publicly their annual releases of certain chemicals. Since the inception of the TRI program in 1986, reported releases of over 300 regulated chemicals have fallen by more than 45 percent. However, since release data is only available for facilities that are required to report to TRI, one cannot determine what reductions in releases would have occurred in the absence of TRI and, therefore, one cannot infer how much of this 45 percent reduction is the direct result of the TRI reporting requirements. The primary purpose of the proposed research is to better isolate the causal effect of TRI on facility-level outcomes. To accomplish this, it is necessary to recognize that the production of toxic releases at a facility is directly linked to production of output at the facility. While we cannot observe releases for facilities that are not required to report to TRI, we can observe output levels for both facilities that are required to report and facilities that are not required to report. This framework can be used to develop a natural experiment for testing the effects of TRI on production technologies and productivity. We will estimate production functions separately for facilities that are required to report to TRI and facilities that are not required to report to TRI and empirically test for differences in the production technologies employed and the productivity of the two groups of facilities. This will help determine whether public disclosure of environmental performance information changes the way facilities do business. In addition, this project will provide a better understanding of the ways in which public disclosure affects facility decision-making. There are several pathways through which reporting of environmental information might lead to pollution reduction, including: green consumerism, green investing, community pressure, the threat of future regulation, and organizational limitations of the firm. We will construct indictors for each of the pathways, estimate the effect of these pathways on changes in the production functions used by reporting and non-reporting facilities, and compare these effects with predictions from a theoretical model of facility-level response to information disclosure requirements. A critical element in the analysis is the construction of a facility-level dataset that contains information on environmental variables, economic variables, and variables that proxy for the four different pathways. We will create this dataset by linking publicly available data from the Toxics Release Inventory, trade organizations, environmental organizations, and other sources with confidential facility-level economic data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) and the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) Survey for the years 1982 to 1999. In addition to providing a clearer understanding of the causal relationship between TRI and facility-level economic outcomes, the creation of this unique dataset will provide opportunities to evaluate and enhance Census data. The Census collects detailed data on the products produced, and the materials used in production, at the 7-digit SIC level (8-digit NAICS level beginning in 1997). However, many facilities do not report data at this level of detail. Instead they report data on products and materials at a higher level of aggregation. Because several of the chemicals that are reported under the TRI are also 7-digit SIC categories (or 8-digit NAICS categories) on the materials and product trailers, we can evaluate whether facilities are better able to report detailed data to Census on their usage of these specific chemicals if they are required to track that data to comply with the TRI. We will also evaluate potential improvements in data reporting that could be obtained if the connections between TRI reported chemicals and Census product and materials categories are enhanced.",5,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures,PAC,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Lori S Bennear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hypotheses can be tested using a direct measure for neighborhood specific risk from Hilber (2001) and using census-track specific mortgage lending decision data (HMDA-data) and data from the AHS that discloses the census-track of a housing unit.

255,Completed,Reaching the Uninsured Through the Individual Market for Health Insurance,Washington,2003,2004.0,Susan Marquis,"Our study will investigate the role the individual health insurance market in California plays in covering the population. It will examine the objective factors, motivations, and attitudes that influence consumers’ decisions to participate in the individual market; how changes in price, benefits design, and public policies would affect that role and the number of uninsured; how purchasers of coverage decide among the plans available to them; and patterns of entry and exit from the individual market for health insurance. We propose to use pooled cross-section and time-series data from two Census surveys—the March Current Population Survey (years 1996 through 2001) and the 1996 SIPP panel—to study decisions to purchase insurance by the potential market in California.
The specific questions we will answer using the CPS and SIPP include:
• What share of the potential market purchases individual coverage in California? How does this vary among important population subgroups?
• What factors influence the decision to purchase individual insurance? Specifically, what is the role of variables that might be affected by factors such as price, nature and number of products available?
• Does the availability of safety net providers affect decisions, especially of the near poor? Is there health selection in participation?
• Does greater diversity in the nature of products available increase market segmentation and alter the health risks participating in the market?
• What affects intra-family decisions about coverage for individual family members?
The study would benefit the Census Bureau in several ways. First, we will increase the utility of the Census data by using it to address important health care issues that we expect will help inform the decision making progress. In addition, to providing estimates of important behavioral relationships in the population, the analysis will yield important descriptive information about those who purchase in the individual insurance market. Second, we will be estimating models using multiple household surveys. Similarities or differences in modeling results will yield information about the reliability and validity of measures from the various surveys. In addition, we have administrative data from insurers in California that we can use to help assess the validity of survey measures. (For example, we can compare average duration of coverage measured in the SIPP panel with duration from administrative records. Any restricted administrative data from participating insurers will be analyzed outside of the Census data center.) Finally, our project statistician is developing ways of combining nonlinear regressions analyses from multiple household surveys that could be used by other researchers.",1,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Kanika Kapur,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
258,Completed,A Study of the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey Data,Berkeley,2003,2003.0,Daniel J Wilson,"The 1998 Annual Capital Expenditure Survey (ACES) is the first micro-level data set to contain information of investment spending broken down into the actual types of capital goods in which firms invest. Part of this project, therefore, will simply be to document the investment behavior of firms in terms of their allocation of capital expenditures across types. In particular, how similar are firms’ investment distributions in total, within-industry, and between-industry. Such an analysis will help researchers determine how representative industry-level capital flows data are of firm-level behavior. I also propose to compare industry-level estimates of the investment distribution from the BEA to those implied by the ACES survey data. Both the documentation of investment patterns and the comparison of the implied industry-level investment distributions to those estimated by the BEA will help determine the value of collecting this detailed investment by type data in ACES and therefore will benefit the Census Bureau. The main purpose of this project, however, will be to measure the individual productivity contributions of various types of capital goods. A large body of empirical research has recently emerged that has found that IT investment, in particular, has a positive contribution to TFP above and beyond the contribution of total capital. The natural question, then, is: are there other capital types that also have “excess” productivity contributions? Matching ACES data to public financial data from Compustat, we can measure output, labor, materials, and total capital and thus construct a conventional measure of total factor productivity (TFP). We can then test for significant relationships between investment shares (i.e. investment in a particular capital types as a share of total investment) and TFP via regression analysis. The coefficients on the investment shares will identify the sign and the magnitude of the excess contributions of each capital type to productivity. This will be of great interest to researchers and decision-makers and therefore will help demonstrate the value of the ACES program.",2,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administered trade is extended through various segments of the federal government to industries under duress from unfair trade practices. The actual impacts of such trade policy actions are unclear, both practically and academically. This project intends to prepare estimates of productivity for certain industries, thereby adding to available estimates that describe the characteristics of the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Possible shortcomings and the documentation of new data collection needs will derive from our comparisons of estimated industry productivity for actual Annual Survey of Manufactures respondents and estimates based of LRD imputations for non-respondents. Differences may be significant between the two, due to the disparities in the possible conditions of plants used for imputation relative to the state of plants for which data was imputed. Lastly, this project intends to help understand LRD based estimates of productivity in relation to alternative productivity measures.",3,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Christopher J Kurz,Jim A Levinsohn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265,Completed,Measurement and Analysis of Diversification,Washington,2003,2005.0,Namsuk Kim,"During business cycles, firms adjust various margins. Research using plant-level data unmasks the plant-level investment path. However, many decisions are made at the firm level. This project explores one of the margins that a firm can adjust during the business cycle; to wit, product diversification. I set up a suggestive model, showing diversification, investment and debt policy. My project will analyze why, when and how the firm diversifies, which is not done in the existing literature. Diversification decisions would be one of the possible reasons why the firm's investment is lumpy and traditional investment and inventory models cannot explain investment. My project is consistent with other research that is beginning to analyze various adjustment margins of the firm. Along with the simulation results from my model, I will find new stylized facts of the annual pattern of firm's diversification at firm and plant level. I have three approaches to do so, dealing with certainty company cases, single units, and multi units. The first two approaches require the ASM and CM. The last one needs LBD data as well.

269,Completed,Measuring the Productivity Impact of Wireless Technology,Berkeley,2004,2006.0,Timothy S Simcoe,"The growing literature on the productivity impact of information technology has revealed that while IT produces large benefits on average, there is usually a significant amount of variation in its firm-level effects. Researchers have turned to organizational differences between firms to help explain this variation, arguing that in many cases there are complementarities between the use of IT and the organization of the enterprise. The empirical challenge is to deal with the problems of endogenous technology adoption and unobserved firm-level heterogeneity that are present in most productivity studies.

The adoption of computerized dispatching technology by taxicab fleets provides a unique opportunity to examine the issue of complementarities between economic organization and technology adoption. The taxicab industry contains a large number of firms delivering a relatively homogeneous good and computerized dispatch technology has had a major impact on the productivity of taxi fleets. Moreover, the contracting between taxi drivers and fleet operators (i.e. whether drivers are employees or contractors) is a significant organization decision that should influence the IT adoption decision. Finally, differences in local regulatory and market conditions provide a source of exogenous variation in the costs and benefits of IT use and different modes of driver contracting.

This project proposes to utilize establishment level data on taxi and livery fleets to test for complementarities between driver contracting and the use of computerized dispatch technology. The econometric tests will include traditional approaches, such as production function estimation, as well as a novel structural method that jointly estimates a production function and the choice of contracting mode.

270,Completed,Import Competition for Domestic Producers:  Denim Cloth and Apparel,Triangle,2003,2005.0,Patrick J Conway,"The US manufacturing sector as a whole has faced increasing international competition in the last generation, but competition was especially intense in textiles and apparel production. It is crucial, both for our understanding of economic forces as well as for decision-making, that the determinants of this evolution be disentangled. I propose to investigate the causes of this decline through empirical examination of production and trade in subsectors of the US textile and apparel industries. In the textile sector the production of broadwoven cotton cloth has stagnated over the last 20 years while the production sub-categories of broadwoven cotton has expanded. I will document the differences in historical performance, and then use plant-level data from the US Census of Manufactures to identify the relevant determinants of this divergence. The methodology used will be regression-based, with semi-parametric techniques used when appropriate. The result will be a decomposition of the observed evolution in employment, wages, productivity and investment in these industries into that attributable to import competition and that attributable to specific other causes. Access to the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), will provide consistent links between the plant-level data of the LRD and the data on international trade and finance found in public databases that will be useful in welfare analyses of trade and globalization. Specifically, links to data on binding quotas in these industries will be created. The project also will provide documentation of potentially useful additions to the Census questionnaire to address the question of unemployment due to trade-related dislocation, as specified in the Trade Adjustment Act and other legislation of the US Congress.

272,Completed,The Impacts of Efforts to Reduce Pollution Emissions on Economic Activity and Environmental Quality:  Evidence from Plant-Level Data,Boston,2004,2007.0,Michael Greenstone,"Over the last three decades, the federal government has attempted to balance the dual and often conflicting goals of promoting economic activity and environmental quality. The tension between these goals arises because regulations that reduce environmental degradation are likely to hamper economic progress. This project will examine one of the most important examples of such a tension – the federal government’s regulation of air pollution through the Clean Air Act. It will be the first comprehensive attempt to empirically estimate the direct costs and benefits of this regulatory program at the plant level. The proposed project will exploit pollution categories established by the EPA. As directed by the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments, the EPA established separate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) – a minimum level of air quality that all counties are required to meet – for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. As part of this legislation every county annually receives separate nonattainment or attainment designations for each of the six pollutants. The nonattainment designation is reserved for counties whose air contains concentrations of the relevant pollutant that exceed the federal standard. Emitters of the regulated pollutant in nonattainment counties are subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. Non-polluters are free from regulation in both categories of counties. This division of counties sets up an interesting quasi-experiment for measuring some of the direct effects of regulation. In principle, it is possible to identify these effects by comparing changes in outcomes in nonattainment and attainment counties. An essential element of this project is the creation of a unique data file that contains plant-level information on pollution emissions and economic activity, as well as detailed measures of regulation. I have already created this file by linking the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (and the Census of Manufactures) for the years 1987 through 1997. The former contains plant-specific releases of more than 600 toxics into the environment, including whether the release was into the air, water, or ground. The latter provides information on plant-level employment, investment, shipments, and other characteristics (e.g., industry, age, and location). This plant-level file will be merged with one containing the annual, pollutant-specific, attainment/nonattainment designations. The application of this quasi-experiment to the above data file will provide estimates for a class of questions that cannot  e posed with traditional public use files. I will estimate the effect of attainment/nonattainment status on pollution emissions, total employment, capital stock, and output. These results will be useful for many purposes. For instance, it will be possible to calculate the regulation-induced trade-off between environmental quality and employment; this trade-off has not been estimated previously but is central to any debate about environmental regulations. Additionally, I will fit plant-level production functions where pollution emissions are treated as an input. The nonattainment variables will serve as instruments for pollution emissions in these equations. The estimation of these equations will produce measures of the increased costs associated with mandated reductions in pollution. It will also be possible to gain insight into how firms adjust their production processes to comply with regulation. In summary, this project’s results will provide an improved understanding of the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations and of how plants alter their production patterns to optimally comply with them. The predominant purpose of this project is to benefit the Census Bureau’s program and it will do so in at least three ways. First, in addition to linking the TRI to the LRD, this project will produce a cross-walk between the LRD PPNs and EPA establishment IDs. This will link the LRD to all plant-level EPA data sets. Thus, the project should be of great use for researchers interested in examining other aspects of pollution releases by manufacturing plants. Second, the project will produce estimates of the economic costs of environmental regulations and these estimates will serve as an important complement to cost estimates from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE). Third, this project’s results may be helpful in identifying methods to refine the PACE’s questionnaire in order to elicit more valuable information.",3,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Elizabeth L Greenwood,Rema N Hanna,Richard Hornbeck,Joshua Linn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
273,Completed,The Changing Structure of The Human Services Industry,Michigan,2003,2004.0,David J Tucker,"Historically responsibility for the provision of human services in the United States has been shared between public and private nonprofit forms of organization. This has changed substantially in the last thirty years with the increasing commercialization of the human services industry as evidenced by the increasing presence of for-profit organizations. While this change in the mix of organizational forms in this industry has resulted in a great deal of literature debating its nature, desirability and future implications, there has been little emphasis on testing arguments about how it occurred or empirically examining its effects. One important reason for this has been an absence of good quality longitudinal data. A second reason has been a tendency among researchers and analysts to emphasize description, prescription or evaluation in their studies, as opposed to explanation and the development of validated theoretical knowledge. Hence, using advanced forms of analysis to deepen theoretical understanding of factors contributing to this change and it effects has not been a central concern. This research proposes to address these constraints first by working to obtain good longitudinal data by modifying the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and second, by using macro-level theories of organization to develop hypotheses about how this change occurred as well as about the nature of the processes underlying certain of its effects. First, on modifying the LBD, we propose to do this by linking with the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and subsequently coding a variable from 1974 to the present for all 5 four digit industries in the 8300 SIC code classification (Social Services) that accurately differentiates establishments in these industries by legal form, i.e., whether or not they are tax-exempt. This not only will result in data appropriate for our research but also will produce significant benefits for the Census Bureau in the form of improved data quality and population estimates and, to a lesser degree, improved methodology. Subsequent to improving the LBD, we propose to focus initially on two questions about changes in the 5 four digit industries in the 8300 (Social Services) SIC code. The first question concerns transformations in legal form, from tax-exempt (nonprofit) to taxable (for-profit) status, and inquires into the survival value to an establishment of changing its legal form from nonprofit to for-profit, or vice versa, i.e., does the risk of dying increase or decrease as a result of such transformations. The second question concerns how variation over time in local environmental conditions affects the mix of legal forms of establishments in that environment by how it influences their rates of births and deaths. We anticipate that the answers to these questions will be of substantial interest to other researchers as well as to analysts, decision-makers and administrators.",4,Census of Services,CSR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,David Sommerfeld,David J Tucker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
276,Completed,Productivity Heterogeneity and Market Segmentation,Chicago,2003,2005.0,Chad W Syverson,"The proposed project is a follow-on to an earlier CES project and consists of two extensions. The first regards the link between market segmentation and price dispersion. This research seeks to utilize the establishment-level Products and Materials Files from the Census of Manufactures (CM) to see if the connection between output substitutability and between-plant productivity differences documented in the earlier project also manifests itself in pricing decisions. The project will characterize if and by how much prices systematically vary across markets within an industry, which could have important sampling frame implications. Furthermore, because of its extensive use of the CM Products and Materials Files, the research is intended to improve the quality and usefulness of this highly detailed but underemployed data. These data suffer from the large amount of imputations within them, which are not always separately identified as such. The project will, for the industries it studies, facilitate comparisons between establishments with and without imputed data to check if and how those plants are systematically different, offering guidance regarding the reliability of the numbers. The second proposed extension applies to the estimation of establishment-level productivity levels. An important product of the earlier project was a data set of local demand-shifting instruments that could be used for, among other things, productivity estimation. Many interesting issues remain with respect to identification of technology parameters with microdata, such as differing rates of return to inputs and input mix selection based upon these differences, plant technology choice and local input markets, and the link between productivity and input choice. The proposed project will explore such issues in a theoretical framework of selection and treatment that has been well developed in the labor literature, but largely unused in productivity research. I plan to obtain measures of the distribution of establishment technologies within industries. These will be linked to other industry-level observables in order to find patterns between technology choice and input and output market structures. (These industry-level technology distribution measures could possibly be made available to other researchers.) It is also expected that this work will identify data that is not presently collected but would be useful for correctly measuring productivity and understanding its dynamics.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Chad W Syverson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
277,Completed,Vertical Integration,Chicago,2003,2005.0,Chad W Syverson,"The proposed project seeks to exploit firm identifiers in establishment lists (the Standard Statistical Establishment Lists [SSELs] and the Census of Manufactures [CM], and possibly the Longitudinal Business Database [LBD]) to obtain measures of vertical integration within the manufacturing sector, and then apply these measures to empirical testing. We wish to measure the extent to which vertically integrated firms comprise industries and, in some cases, markets within industries. We will identify manufacturing establishments in vertically integrated firms by identifying plants whose owning firm also owns establishments in vertically linked industries. A comprehensive vertical integration measure would account for establishments in non-manufacturing sectors (e.g., when a manufacturer owns its retail outlets). If data limitations preclude this, it is still possible to obtain (more limited) “within-manufacturing” measures of vertical integration using only Longitudinal Research Database / CM data. We will conduct both industry-level and plant-level empirical analyses with these vertical integration measures. The proposed project will expectedly produce a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. We will construct and document an industry-level panel data set of vertical integration measures that can be used for a number of purposes. These include, but are not limited to, economic research into the interactions between integration and/or vertical mergers on input and output markets, comparison to more simply derived industry vertical integration measures (such as the ratio of value added to total output) to gauge the more simple measures’ accuracy, and analysis of legal policies that affect or are affected by the extent of vertical integration. These indices are novel and would be computed at an aggregate (industry) level; as such, they may be able to be made available to other researchers. Additionally, by investigating specifically the quality of the firm identifiers in the SSELs (which are of course of crucial interest to the success of this project), we will augment the considerable establishment-linking efforts that have been made to create the Longitudinal Business Database. Given the availability of establishment lists outside of the manufacturing sector, we will also be able to characterize the extent to which intersectoral ownership has changed over time. This may be of particular interest to the Census Bureau as its economic programs shift focus to non-manufacturing sectors. Finally, we will be able to provide estimates of a number of elasticities in the population. These include the responsiveness of vertical integration to technology and market structure (at both the industry and establishment levels), and the correlations between changes in vertical integration status and productivity. These estimates can be made exploiting both between-establishment differences and intertemporal variations within establishments.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Enterprise Summary Report - ES9100 (large company),ESR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Ali Hortacsu,Chad W Syverson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
282,Completed,Analysis of Census Nonemployer Data and Integration of These  Data into Other Census Longitudinal Data Series,Washington,2002,2003.0,Rick Boden,"There has been a relative groundswell of empirical studies of business survival/turnover over the past decade.  However, most of these studies have one notable limitation--i.e., they are typically restricted to employer businesses.  The Center for Economic Studies (CES) has acquired microdata on tens of millions of nonemployer ""firms.""  I propose longitudinally linking as many of these records as possible over the years for which the nonemployer microdata are available.  I also plan to match these records to the Census Bureau's business register, as well as one of the Bureau's longitudinal business microdata files.  Upon completion of these matches, I intend to revisit empirical modeling of business dissolution (using hazard functions), to analyze the inter-temporal transition of business entities into and out of employer status, and to analyze patterns in receipts change (for surviving entities) over time.  Some of the other questions that I intend to address in this project include the following.  How many new employer firms were previously nonemployer firms?  What are the general patterns of transition of business entities between employer and nonemployer status?  How many firms with receipts below Census' cutoff (to be included in published nonemployer statistics) actually continue and grow to exceed that receipts threshold in subsequent years?  How do macro- and local economic conditions influence business formation and dissolution?

283,Completed,Rural Civic Community and Population Stability: Linking Civic Structure and Individual Migration Behavior,Chicago,2003,2006.0,Michael D Irwin,"Many rural communities are losing economically and socially viable populations, tax bases, essential services, and retail establishments. But, there are also cases of rural communities that are thriving and, in doing so, are retaining their populations and stemming the tide of rural out-migration. Our proposed research will evaluate the factors that aid rural communities in retaining their population. Specifically this research will analyze the effect of the civic institution in rural communities (such as churches, local businesses and local associations) upon individuals – probabilities of staying in their communities. Individual migration/nonmigration behavior will be modeled using the full internal decennial microdata for 1990 and 2000 (as it becomes available). County contextual effects on these individual behaviors will be modeled using internal Economic Census microdata from 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997 as well as from publicly available county level data (such as the Census of Agriculture). The individual models will summarize the effects of individual economic, demographic and social characteristics that affect migration/nonmigration behavior. County contextual effects will quantify the influence of community economic conditions and social conditions that alter these individual behavioral models. Assessment of these contextual estimates will summarize the degree to which community structure alters individual behavior. Thus our research objectives are first to specify the relationship between rural community context and individual migration behavior, and second to test the relative importance of individual characteristics, community economic characteristics and community social characteristics in retaining rural populations. Our approach will also provide a number of benefits to the US Census Bureau. These benefits include linking decennial and economic data over time at the county level and linking the decennial time series and economic census time series on counties together. Further we will provide an important alternative measurement for migration in these data, by evaluating two measures of migration – cross county migration and cross labor market migration. This latter definition may provide a clear demarcation between purely residential movements within a community and economically determined movements between communities. Comparison of predictive estimates for the two types of migration will quantify these differences. We believe our project will also provide an important quality assessment of the 2000 decennial data. By linking 1990 to 2000 data, then modeling individual migration behaviors (and relevant characteristics) we will provide a unique quality assessment of the 2000 data. Our research approach models individual behaviors at the county level and assesses contextual differences among counties in these predicted behaviors. As we evaluate the stability of individual migration behavior within each county in 1990 and 2000 we will identify counties where sharp changes in our predictive models occur, and assess whether such differences are due to changes in contextual conditions or are artifacts of Census coverage in the two time periods.",8,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Decennial Census,CEN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
284,Completed,Capital  Adjustment and Productivity Patterns of Plants and Firms in the U.S. Food and Kindred Products Industry,Michigan,2003,2005.0,Pinar Celikkol Geylani,"Productivity advancement has been a major contributing factor to economic growth in the postwar U.S. economy and more accurate measurement of productivity and growth will assist future industry and government decision-making activities. The proposed research address some fundamental issues related to productivity and growth in the food-manufacturing sector by focusing on the stimuli to productivity growth. By focusing on the investment patterns of Food and Kindred Products Industry, this project will
• Examine the behavior of capital adjustment patterns of plants and firms
• Examine the dynamic factor demand decisions and resource allocations of the constituent units of the firm
• Examine long-argued capital measurement problems surrounding the time series data
• Investigate implications of the empirical evidence for the shape of the adjustment cost function
• Analyze productivity changes of plants and firms under these capital adjustment cost and investment patterns
• Identify and distinguish the gains from investment spikes as indicative of the lifting the plateau to a new one that can lead to longer periods of productivity growth from the productivity gains within an investment period.
Thus this proposal intends to take the literature one step further by investigating how capital and its adjustments influence productivity. Generally, plant-level studies analyzing productivity dynamics concentrate on the overall manufacturing plants in U.S., while studies analyzing productivity issues in the Food and Kindred Products industry primarily concentrate on the aggregate level. There are currently no studies that analyze the productivity dynamics at the most disaggregated plant level, considering all product subgroups of the food-manufacturing sector. With this study, we will be able to focus on investment patterns and lumpy capital adjustment costs separately analyzing all sub-industries of the food sector, which allows us to capture extensive heterogeneity within and across industries. The Food and Kindred Products industry is an excellent candidate for investigating lumpy investment patterns as the industry has become increasingly capital-intensive, and high-tech over the past few decades in the processing, packaging, and marketing of food products (Morrison, 1997). Therefore, the data required for this research is the U.S. Census’ Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for the years 1963-1999 containing the annual establishment level production data for the manufacturing plants and firms specifically in Food and Kindred Products Industry. 
For an accurate measurement of productivity growth, we need to consider economies of scale, productivity enhancing changes arising from factors such as experience, learning-by-doing, increased knowledge, new innovations, better techniques for producing output, measuring relative capital intensity of production technology, existence of quasi-fixity of inputs, and the adjustment cost of these factors. As capital input is a significant component of total cost, analyzing the behavior of quasi-fixed factors in the measurement of productivity is crucial, especially if the firms require massive amounts of capital in the form of plant and equipment. Therefore, confidential Census data is essential to investigate the effect of capital adjustment on productivity and to develop a method, which can control for plant and firm fixed effects in measuring the productivity at plant and firm level. This research will provide benefit to the Census Bureau by developing a new improved measure of economic growth associated with investment spikes. This methodology removes procyclical biases associated with the business cycle. Thus it has the potential to propose changes in the questionnaire design and collection methodology to improve the economic content of the information gathered by the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) in the area of capital input series and total factor productivity at both the plant and firm level. By computing productivity at both levels, the researcher will be able to separately estimate both plant level productivity and firm level productivity in relation to aggregate level productivity. Previous studies have shown that aggregate growth measures may be significantly reduced when using the plant level data. Therefore the disaggregated measure of total factor productivity generated by this research will assist the Census Bureau in determining and evaluating whether the aggregation problem found in the literature is due to underlying economic forces or if it is possibly due to the questionnaire design or collection methodology.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Pinar Celikkol Geylani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
286,Completed,Using the Survey of Plant Capacity to Measure Capital Utilization,Michigan,2005,2009.0,Matthew H Shapiro,"Most capital in the United States is idle much of the time. By some measures, the average work week of capital in U.S. manufacturing is as low as 55 hours per 168-hour week. The level and variability of capital utilization has important implications for understanding both the level of production and its cyclical fluctuations. This proposal will investigate a number of issues relating to the Survey of Plant Capacity measures. It will aim to better understand the behavior of these measures in the panel of plants and in the aggregate. It will use this analysis to make recommendations on expanding and improving the published statistics deriving from the Survey of Plant Capacity. These statistics could increase the value of this survey at low incremental cost. This improved information about the utilization margin would be a substantial benefit for economists and decision makers. Capital utilization is an important margin for understanding fluctuations in output and productivity at the plant and aggregate level and in firms’ decisions about adding or subtracting from their stocks of factors of production. This research will examine how Survey of Plant Capacity measurements can contribute to studying these issues.",3,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Daniel H Cooper,Yuriy Gorodnichenko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
287,Completed,Health and Migration in the Continental United States,Michigan,2003,2012.0,Arline T Geronimus,"Mounting evidence that similar individuals residing in different places have varying life chances has given rise to the possibility that racially-segregated urban environments have a particularly insidious impact on the health of African American residents of high poverty urban areas. However, observed geographic patterning of health outcomes might also reflect systematic health-related migration across local residential areas -- for example, the in- or out- migration of the most or least healthy residents into high poverty urban areas. Research on this issue is scant because few data sets link health and migration. 
Our primary goal is to test the hypothesis that selective health-related migration affects geographic variations in local population health. To do so, we will need to analyze confidential data from responses to the Census question that asks respondents to the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses where they resided 5 years earlier. Thus, for our work at the Research Data Center, we propose to use the Sample Edited Detail File (SEDF) of the 1990 Decennial Census, and the similar data from the 2000 census when it becomes available. The SEDF represents roughly 16% of the population and includes all the long-form records including the critical question on prior residence that is not available on the public use files released by the Census Bureau. Of benefit to the Bureau, this project will improve understanding of the quality of Census data and improve Census-based estimates of local population health. Should we find that health related migration biases estimates of population health, this will identify shortcomings of current data collection and document new data collection needs. By estimating disability rates for select high poverty and minority populations, taking selective health-related migration into account, we will provide more accurate estimates of the health status of these local populations than currently exist. In addition, our study will shed light on the feasibility of using the Census to study short distance moves and will enable us to determine the extent and nature of missing data on relevant items. If our results support the value of using detailed geography when studying migration patterns, it would suggest that, subject to other considerations, the Census might consider including more detailed geographic information, such as census tract of prior residence, in the data released for use at Research Data Centers, so that investigators do not have to rely on “county” or census “place” of prior residence.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,John Bound,Elizabeth E Bruch,Arline T Geronimus,Erin L Linnenbringer,Annie E Ro,Tara Shochet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
289,Completed,The Importance of Relocations in U.S. Manufacturing,Michigan,2006,2008.0,Yoonsoo Lee,"A firm can grow over a sustained period of time by renewing itself through recurrent responses to various internal and external challenges. In the short run, a firm expands and contracts its activities and the number of workers it employs. Some radical changes in the environment, however, may lead a firm to shut down a plant and start over in a new location. Because of this, competition among state and local governments to lure businesses has attracted considerable interest from economists, as well as legislators and decision-makers, regarding issues influencing relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities. While this process of relocation can cause dramatic shifts in activity and employment at the regional levels, as well as at the firm levels, very little is known about the actual patterns of relocation in the U.S. economy. Only a few previous studies have looked at how manufacturing firms geographically locate their production, and most of these have focused on either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This project expands on this previous work by summarizing the patterns of plant relocation and the post-move performance of relocated plants using the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period 1963-1999 using non-publicly available plant and firm level data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Focusing on an individual firm’s decision to relocate, this project analyzes information on the relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities in the following three subprojects. First, this project assesses the relative importance of relocation across industries and regions by constructing industry level measures of entry, relocation, and exit. The study then examines whether relocation produces different patterns in plant openings and closings compared to de novo entry and permanent exit. Second, this project studies the characteristics of relocated plants along with their decision to relocate. Econometric model estimation will characterize how individual firms’ geographic shifts of production processes are influenced by taxes, unionization, factor prices, ownership, and other geographic and plant specific characteristics. Third, this project investigates the impact of geographic shifts on a firm’s post move production by comparing the growth rates of output and productivity for newly relocated plants to those of existing plants in the original location. The inverse growth-age relation suggested by Jovanovic’s (1982) firm- learning model is tested for relocating plants to examine whether the inverse growth-age relation observed among young firms also holds for relocating plants that start over in a new space. This project provides a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. These benefits include producing new statistics on the geographic movement of manufacturing activities at the firm level thereby suggesting a new way to expand the utility of the LRD in describing the geographic patterns of economic activities in the United States. Results of this research may also demonstrate the need for new measures of relocation to be incorporated in future surveys. Additionally by establishing links to the original plant of relocated plant, this research examines the consistency of geographic identifiers by potentially identifying previously undocumented coding problems and improves the understanding of regional linkages in the LRD. A better understanding of the dynamic geographic distribution of firm activity will help characterize the patterns of firm ownership that could be valuable for designing inquires on the Company organization survey that is an important Title 13 component of the Standard Statistical Establishment List.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Yoonsoo Lee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
293,Completed,Comparison of the Distributions of Production and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing: Phase II.,Chicago,2003,2007.0,Gale A Boyd,"Industrial energy demand typically involves base load consumption. As a result the industrial component of energy demand has important implications in evaluating energy infrastructure, i.e. oil, gas, electric power. There is growing concern that the energy infrastructure could be subject to both natural (e.g. storms or equipment failure) and manmade (e.g. terrorist) disruptions. To address the economic and human implications of such a disruption, planning agencies are taking a closer look at the energy infrastructure and its customers to assess its robustness and ability to continue vital functions as well as identify potential weaknesses. This project uses the LRD and MECS databases to estimate a distribution-company-level model of industrial energy demand for natural gas and electricity via a plant-level energy demand equation. An element unique to this study is the use of “establishment location” in a geographic information system (GIS) to create new, supplemental data on the relationship between the plant and the energy distribution system. These supplemental data are then used to improve the forecasting abilities of the econometric model. The benefits to the Census Bureau include 1) the creation of the GIS layers that can be used to access various data sources such as the LRD, MECS, and SSEL, in an intuitive visual mode which highlights spatial relationships, 2) the link across the LRD and MECS to create plant-level energy prices, and 3) the forecasting equations that can be used to impute non-response to energy questions in the ASM and MECS.",5,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey,MECS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Karl D Boulware,Ryan M Gallagher,Nancy A Hammond,Erika V Martinez,Bela B Szemely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The welfare effect of minimum quality standards is theoretically controversial and empirically poorly documented due to data limitations. The panel nature of this data set will make this study able to control state fixed effects and time fixed effects, in order to better answer: Will more stringent minimum quality standards reduce supply in the child care market? Will more stringent standards force more firms to exit the market? Will more stringent standards motivate firms to pursue higher quality via accreditation? This study will be the first in the field in the sense that it uses panel data to study the supply side of a market subject to minimum quality standards. This proposal will benefit the Census Bureau by incorporating external sources of data into the Census data, corroborating the Census data, providing estimates of the child care industry, and understanding industry dynamics.",2,Census of Services,CSR,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Juan Pantano,Mo Xiao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
297,Completed,A Proposal to Study Sorting of Households by Race and Income in Locational Equilibrium Using 1990 Decennial Census Long Form Data,CMU,2002,2005.0,Dennis Epple,"There is substantial theoretical and empirical research investigating the role of neighborhood effects in influencing socio-economic outcomes for minorities.  This research output points to both the importance of differentiating among ethnic groups and incorporating neighborhood effects into locational equilibrium models.  Urban economists have also investigated sorting by race when households have preferences about the racial composition of the area in which they live. Less work has been devoted to analyzing the interaction of preferences for neighborhood demographic composition and local public goods in determining the sorting of population by race across communities. We would like to know whether observed differences in racial sorting are due to differences in tastes for housing, tastes for public goods and endowments, or whether they can be attributed to tastes for racial homogeneity.  We propose to develop and estimate a locational equilibrium model to analyze sorting of households by demographic characteristics and income within a system of communities, paying special attention to neighborhood and local spillover effects. Thus understanding the formation of communities and neighborhoods, the sorting of households that differ by income, the demographic characteristics and tastes among a set of communities, and the interaction of households within communities are the objective of our proposed research.  Although issues of individual sorting into communities and the provision of local public services have been studied for the last 50 years, previous empirical studies have been hampered by important data limitations.  In particular, representative publicly available micro data are available only at a relatively high degree of aggregation thus limiting research attempts to understand the underlying household choice process involved.  This research proposes the use of the Decennial Census Long Form (CENSAS) data, which provides a detailed picture of each household's characteristics including place of residence and place(s) of work. The precise geographic information allows us to accurately match the important economic variables associated with each possible choice that a household could make. The level of geographic and demographic detail of the confidential data is essential to allowing us to properly analyze community characteristics that directly effect how households from different backgrounds sort across communities.  Our primary interest is in using the CENSAS Data for 1990 for a number of US metropolitan areas such as Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh (as the decennial data is representative of the U.S. population, the wider applicability of our results is assured). We are also interested in comparing measures of the stratification and segregation of households by income and race across communities and between public and private schools in the 2000 data to those in the 1990 data.  Consequently, we would like to analyze the 2000 CENSAS Data as well when it becomes available.  We should emphasize, however, that our research project is feasible using only the 1990 data.

298,Completed,Minority Suburban Migration:  A New Analytic Paradigm,Michigan,2006,2009.0,William H Frey,"The proposed research introduces a new paradigm for the study of minority migration within metropolitan areas that goes beyond the “black-white, city-suburb” typology, which characterizes most of the detailed census migration analyses to date. This study takes cognizance of two developments. First, immigration and the recent foreign-born population have increased significantly over the past two decades, creating a broader mix of race and ethnic minorities. Their movement, both into and within the metropolitan area, requires a new understanding of race-based migration dynamics of the central city and within the suburbs.  This study develops such a paradigm, which explicitly recognizes new immigrant minorities and their migration components; as well as the heterogeneity of community types that have developed within the suburbs. Using a comparative metropolitan framework based on the 25 largest metropolitan areas, this research will show how race and ethnic immigrant/native migration processes vary across zones of suburban communities and central cities and how they are shaped by these areas’ and their metropolitan areas’ sociodemographic and structural features. This study will develop a new multicategory typology and operationalize it within the 25 largest core based metropolitan statistical areas to be identified in 2003 by the Office of Management and Budget. It will also employ this typology in an analysis of intrametropolitan migration processes for these metropolitan areas, toward assessing the analytic utility of the typology.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
299,Completed,Intergenerational Inequality in the US,Chicago,2007,2011.0,Bhashkar Mazumder,"This research project proposes three major areas of study in order to better understand the intergenerational transmission of inequality. First, building on Mazumder’s previous work, the 1984 and 1990 Surveys of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to the Social Security Administration’s Summary Earnings Records (SER) and Detailed Earnings Records (DER) will be used to measure the intergenerational elasticity in earnings between fathers and their children. Second, a highly structured model of earnings dynamics will be estimated using pooled data from the 1984, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1996 SIPPs matched to both the SER and DER. Among other things, this will provide a definitive view of the degree to which the rise in inequality during the 1980s and 1990s reflected changes in the distribution of permanent income. Third, a rich array of measures of family background and neighborhood characteristics will be used to better understand the underlying process by which income is transmitted from parents to children. This analysis will make use of the internal SIPP and Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) files that contain the detailed geographic identifiers. There are four benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau that will be derived from this study: an analysis of the reliability of using short-term averages of SIPP earnings as a proxy for permanent earnings, a study of the quality of earnings data for an attrited sample such as the SPD, an analysis of the quality of self-employment income data in the SIPP, and an analysis of the biases from using a sample derived from a match based on social security numbers.",3,Survey of Income and Program Participation - Longitudinal,SIP-LON,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,SIPP Public-Use Crosswalk,SXW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,David A Benson,Jonathan M Davis,Weiting Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), we plan to revise our working paper NBER #6270 and CES-WP-98-3 we produced under a prior BRDC project. Second, we intend to investigate the impact of the change in industrial classification systems from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) from a spatial perspective. The NAICS represents a move forward in industrial classification from the SIC, but it is still difficult to appraise the geographic implications of this change in classification, both from the perspective of the longitudinal transition across years of Census of Manufacturers before and after 1997, as well as for what we know about the geographic distribution of economic activity. Does the geographic concentration of NAICS classified industries differ from that of comparable SIC classified industries, or are they very similar? By comparing locational measures for different industry classifications, we can begin to tell whether different classifications create different biases that Census planners and researchers need to be aware of. Finally, by looking at changes in industry classification for plants over time, we can check whether the NAICS system has led to more or less consistency in classification over time.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,William R Kerr,Joshua Linn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
306,Completed,Political Environments and Manufacturing Employment and Investment,Boston,2005,2007.0,William R Kerr,"This study will characterize how changes in political environments from 1963–2000 influenced the employment and investment decisions, including technology adoption, of manufacturing establishments. Special attention will be given to the impact of elections themselves, including expectations of the candidates’ ideologies. In the face of uncertain elections, are plants more reserved in their hiring or investing behavior? Do the victories of candidates with very strong ideologies lead to discrete adjustments in anticipation of future conditions? Three econometric specifications will be considered: standard cross-sectional regressions; a state border discontinuity analysis; and a longitudinal analysis using a balanced 1973–1988 panel of Annual Survey of Manufacturing plants. Use of detailed plant data housed at the Center for Economic Studies is essential for isolating the impact of local politics on establishment behavior, employing a border effects analysis that requires county identification, and characterizing the different reactions of local, single-plant firms versus establishments part of large, regionally-diverse enterprises. 
This project is a response to the July 2001 Research Opportunities at the Census Bureau publication that requests proposals studying how higher-order moments (i.e., skewness, kurtosis) of the cross-section distribution of investment and employment variables should be made publicly available. To identify the influences of regional political environments and elections, I will need to calculate these higher-order moments for individual states and perhaps smaller county/MSA divisions. In a technical memo, I will be able to characterize the best candidate metrics for release from the perspectives of the Census Bureau and potential researchers, the limits to disaggregating geographically these moments (either due to confidentiality concerns or data quality issues), and if and how these higher-order moments should be calculated in non-Census of Manufacturers years.

This proposal will use that work in an extension to identify potential sources and explanations for the cases where data do not coincide. These discrepancies will be systematically categorized. Second, we will investigate the relationship between corporate governance and plant performance. Twenty years ago the term “corporate governance"" did not exist in the English language. In the last two decades, however, corporate governance issues have gained a prominent role in the academic literature. In spite of the importance of the topic and the magnitude of the interests at stake, there is very little empirical evidence on what the effects of corporate governance are and what constitutes “good” and “bad” governance. For this purpose we will build on the LRD-COMPUSTAT match and use ownership concentration and governance variables from CD-Spectrum to investigate the relationship between firm performance and governance.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Antoinette Schoar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
312,Completed,Misreporting of Program Participation in the Current Population Survey:,UCLA,2002,2004.0,Jacob A Klerman,"The proposed study will analyze Medicaid administrative files (including information on welfare receipt) for California linked with survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to explore the misreporting of program participation (Medicaid and welfare) in the CPS. The resulting estimates will provide both methodological and substantive insights.  On a methodological level, by comparing individual level survey and administrative data, we can better understand the nature of the biases in survey responses and the success of the standard Census imputations.  Furthermore, from these results, we will construct simple models of survey errors that can be used by others (without access to matched administrative data) to adjust survey data.  On a substantive level, the resulting estimates will be used to generate improved estimates of the levels of program participation in California and the nation as a whole and the levels and determinants of Medi-Cal and TANF take-up among eligibles.  These issues are particularly important because while welfare policy continues to be actively debated and the Census surveys provide the data underlying that debate, comparisons of aggregate counts from administrative data with Census surveys show under-reporting of program participation of twenty-five percent or more even after data processing and imputation.

317,Completed,Efficiency Implications of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from Micro Data,Triangle,2003,2005.0,Ekaterina E Emm,"In this project, we contribute to the ongoing research on the rationales for corporate diversification. Using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) as our main source of data, we examine whether combining several lines of business under one corporate umbrella leads to increased productive performance. Studying the direct effect of diversification on productive efficiency allows us to discern between two major theories of corporate diversification: the agency cost hypothesis and the synergy hypothesis. Further, the project contributes to the literature by investigating whether efficiency differences between diversified and focused firms lead to the “diversification discount”. To measure productive efficiency, we employ a non-parametric approach, the Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM), using establishment-level and firm-level data. This method has several advantages over other conventional measures of productive efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this project is the first application of the WAPM to a sample of non-financial institutions. This project will provide benefits to the Census Bureau’s data programs through understanding and improving the quality of the data. The project will merge the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM/LRD), Census of Manufactures (CM/LRD), Company Auxiliary Offices (CAO), National Employer Survey (NES), Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), and the time-linked version of the SSEL called the Longitudinal Business Database with the public-use databases COMPUSTAT, Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and Security Data Corporation (SDC). Once the databases are merged, comparisons of the data items collected by the Census Bureau to the data contained in the public-use databases will be performed.

331,Completed,"Race, Ethnicity, and Residential Choice in Multilevel Perspective",UCLA,2003,2006.0,Melissa C Chiu,"This research seeks to use the Long form sample of the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses to investigate residential choice patterns at two levels of geography, the labor market area and the neighborhood. In this study, I define labor market areas as groups of counties that have substantial commuting ties (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996). Neighborhood will be measured by Census Tract or BNA. I investigate how individuals’ decisions to stay or to move, and to where, are affected by racial, ethnic, and immigrant composition. The study will assess whether residential choice patterns are consistent with any of the following theoretical frameworks: (1) avoidance of racial outgroups, (2) preference for one's racial ingroup, (3) economic avoidance of poor areas, (4) race and ethnicity based social capital, and (5) classic spatial assimilation, in which immigrant groups reside in more higher status areas as they gain socioeconomic status. I examine variations in choice patterns by racial group, ethnicity, and nativity status, as well as recent trends from 1985 to 2000, paying particular attention to intragenerational changes for immigrant cohorts. The study is especially interested in differences for labor market area versus neighborhood choice. Statistical analysis will utilize a nested discrete choice model in which the top level consists of labor market areas and the bottom level consists of all neighborhoods within the chosen labor market area. The main geographic characteristics of interest are racial, ethnic, and immigrant composition, but the models will also control for economic conditions, such as unemployment and poverty rates, and area type, e.g. metropolitan or nonmetropolitan, and urban, suburban, or rural status. Individual level variables will include race, ethnicity, and nativity, human capital information, such as education and occupation, and demographic traits such as age and marital status. Spouse’s demographic information will also be included if available. This proposed project provides several benefits for the Census Bureau. First, I will document all coding errors and inconsistencies in the data within census year. Second, I will examine racial classification changes between 1990 and 2000 for spatial concentration and migration. Third, I will provide statistics for examining the change in migration question from five- to one- year migration. Fourth, I will assess tract population change and homogeneity over the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Fifth, I will produce estimates of the population characteristics in the areas of spatial concentration and migration rates, by racial category.

333,Completed,Technology Use and Worker Outcomes: Evidence from Linked Employer-Employee Data,Washington,2004,2005.0,Javier - Miranda,"There is widespread evidence that in the last few decades there has been a widening gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers. Numerous empirical studies suggest there is a link between this growing skill wage differential and the use of new technologies. However, most of these studies have one notable limitation – i.e., they are typically restricted to cross-sectional data, and thus, unable to control for unobservable worker and firm characteristics. This makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of selection bias from the true productivity effects of using these technologies. Distinguishing these two components ideally requires longitudinal information from both workers and firms. With this project we intend to investigate the impact technology use has on workers’ wages in U.S. manufacturing plants by constructing and exploiting a unique Linked Employee-Employer data set containing longitudinal worker and plant information. Among other things, the construction of this dataset will develop links across time and entities using census data and administrative data, will also explore the value of administrative data to provide economic information to enhance census surveys, and furthermore, will identify some shortcomings of census collection programs. We will examine the effect of technology use on wage determination and ask the following questions: Does the skill wage differential increase after the implementation of new technologies in the workplace as suggested by the skill biased technological change hypothesis? Or do high tech firms employ a selection of high ability workers? And if demand for low skilled workers indeed falls after the introduction of new technologies, do we observe the adjustment of prices or quantities? Does the hazard of exiting the firm increase for low skilled workers after the introduction of new technologies? Is skill upgrading a consequence of technology adoption? This project will address these questions using the Long Form of the 1990 Decennial Census, the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies (1988 and 1993), the Business Register (SSEL 1985-1997), and Unemployment Insurance data for the state of Maryland.",3,Decennial Census,CEN,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Adela Luque,Javier - Miranda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
335,Completed,"An Economic Analysis of Availability, Choice and Valuation of School Quality Using the 1990 Decennial Census Long Form Data",Berkeley,2003,2006.0,Fernando V Ferreira,"The proposed project uses the 1990 Decennial Census Long Form Data for California to investigate the consequences of barriers to sorting, such as availability of houses and transaction costs, in the housing market equilibrium and its effects on the valuation of school quality. It builds on research by Bayer, McMillan, and Rueben. The methodology is based on the estimation of random coefficients multinomial logits, where I examine how different choice sets affect household sorting, after accounting for transaction costs, and modeling household mobility explicitly (mobility as a probability of moving to a different house unit). The inclusion of this extra modeling will permit the estimation of unbiased probabilities of households choosing a certain house/neighborhood. Also, the new models make it possible to identify the characteristics of individuals most affected by barriers to sorting. Only with such information can one understand how individual preferences determine location decisions and how important school quality is in determining housing choices within a heterogeneous population. Hypothesis testing will be performed on the average marginal willingness to pay for school quality estimates, as well as on the heterogeneity in individual preferences estimates. The research is feasible given the richness of the Decennial Census Long Form Data. These data provide the geographic location of each household’s place of residence at the Census block level, allowing the choice sets to be defined precisely in terms of house attributes/neighborhood characteristics. Also, with the Decennial Census Long Form Data, I can accurately assign a public school to each house unit, providing a school quality measure that will be extensively used in the estimations. This research yields benefits to the Census Bureau that fall into four areas: (1) compiling a series of external datasets to be linked to the 2000 Decennial Census Long Form Data; (2) analyzing measurement errors in the self-reported ‘travel time to work’ variable; (3) providing comparisons between allocation methods for the ‘travel time to work’ variable; (4) providing an algorithm for linking Census data with data from other sources, with an application to public school data. I will also attempt to create weights for school attendance areas and estimates relating school-age children and households with children in school.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
338,Completed,The Impact of Native American Casinos on Local Communities,Washington,2003,2006.0,William N Evans,"In the late 1980s, a series of legal rulings favorable to tribes and the subsequent passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 legalized gaming operations on reservations in many states. Today, there are over 310 gaming operations run by more than 200 of the nations’ 556 federally recognized tribes. Of these operations, about 220 are “Las Vegas” style casinos with slot machines and/or table games. By 1999, about half of tribal members in the lower 48 states are in tribes that run a casino-style gaming operation. By 2000, Indian-owned gaming operations generated about $10 billion in revenues, about one-sixth of all revenues generated by legal gaming in this country. Given the large number of tribes that have embraced casino gaming as an economic development program, it is worth considering whether Indians on reservations have benefitted from these operations. As the legal and legislative controversies surrounding tribal-owned gaming persist, the interest in this question continues to grow. The authors of this proposal are currently involved in the first nationwide evaluation of the social and economic impact of Native American-owned gaming operations on tribes and their surrounding communities. Evans and Topoleski find that four years after tribes open casinos, employment increases by 26 percent, and tribal population increases by about 12 percent, resulting in an increase in employment to population ratios of five percentage points or about 12 percent. These benefits are not without costs. Their results indicate that although casinos improve aggregate employment in the counties where they are located, employment falls in surrounding counties. They also show that bankruptcy and crime rates increase in counties after a tribal-owned casino opens. The investigators of this proposal outline a research program that uses restricted-use data from the 1990 and 2000 Census long-form samples to examine the impact of gambling on people who live on or near reservations. The long-form samples are sent to one in six households and contain a wealth of social, demographic, and economic information about households and their members. Public use versions of this data do not contain enough geographic detail to place households in particular tribes or on reservations, but detailed geographic data are available on restricted-use versions of the data set. Most of the tribal-owned gaming operations opened during the 1990s so the dates of the Census are fortuitous. One can examine the impact of a new casino by looking at changing economic outcomes for people that lived on or near reservations before and after the casino opened and compare these to changes for Census respondents whose tribes did not adopt gaming.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has implications for the shipping sector, transportation patterns, energy use, and pollution. This project examines the detailed data from the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) linked to the LRD to estimate a model of mode choice. The National Energy Modeling system (NEMS) uses freight mode choice to forecast energy use in this sector, but is based on fixed shares from the 1977 CFS. The aggregate data show large shift in mode with higher value products are more likely to use premium shipment modes, like air freight. However, the aggregate data is insufficient to estimate the combined effects of shipper and shipment specific effects that the linked CFS and LRD can provide. This project estimates the industry and product specific determinants of this underlying economic choice that can be used in NEMS to improve its forecasting capability.

347,Completed,"Improving Data on Emissions and Voluntary Program Participation and Estimating Relationships among Participation, Emissions, and Other Plant Characteristics",Washington,2005,2008.0,Jhih-shyang Shih," 
Collected under Title 13, Chapter 5, of the U.S. Code, the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Manufacturing Energy Consumption survey all contain important information about plant-level activity in the United States and associated material and energy use. Over the past decade, voluntary environmental programs have played an increasingly important role in environmental and energy management. Yet existing programs have been subject to only limited empirical study. An important question is whether participation in these programs is important enough to warrant inclusion in future surveys, analogous to current questions about energy management. 
This project will increase the knowledge base of the U.S. Census Bureau and other researchers and analysts by merging existing data with additional information on emissions and voluntary program participation. First, this project will allow us to examine the impact of voluntary program participation and whether it warrants inclusion in future surveys. Second, the project improves our understanding of plant characteristics and activities while checking the quality of existing data. Third, the merged datasets will allow us to calculate population estimates of emissions and other measures of plant activity with and without the voluntary programs. 
All three results promise important benefits for the Census Bureau in its effort to improve the quality and usefulness of both existing Title 13, Chapter 5 data, as well as future survey instruments. Understanding how program participation interacts with other inputs and outputs can indicate whether participation indicators would be useful in future data collection. Comparisons with newly merged datasets allow for verification of some data elements. Even where direct comparisons are not possible, we can observe anomalies in indirect comparisons (for example, energy use and emissions) that signal a quality issue. As we compute population estimates of plant emissions and activity with and without voluntary programs, we will make use of state-of-the-art sample selection techniques. Such techniques, which are analogous to missing data techniques, could prove useful in other areas of work with Census Bureau data where population estimates are necessary despite significant problems with missing data. Finally, we expect this work to generate suggestions for improved survey design in the future. 
The last result will provide some of the first quantified estimates of voluntary program consequences involving careful attention to sample selection issues. Drawing on experience with EPA’s 33/50 and Climate Wise programs, and DOE’s 1605(b) program, the proposed research will identify program consequences based on competing sample selection approaches that jointly model voluntary program participation and emission outcome. The assumptions inherent in these competing models can alter or reverse estimated population effects. Comparing estimates across models and programs, we expect to draw conclusions that will be more robust and therefore more valuable for future decision-making.

348,Completed,The Health Care Safety Net and Employer Health Insurance Provision,Chicago,2004,2006.0,Anthony T Lo sasso,"Little is known about the role of the local health care safety net in affecting employers’ decisions to offer health insurance to their workers and the characteristics of the health insurance offered. The availability of safety net health care services may induce some firms not to offer health insurance to workers. Examples of firms that might be most likely to consider public sources of health care a potential substitute for privately-offered insurance include small firms with potentially high health insurance costs, firms hiring predominantly low-wage, low-skill workers, or firms in economically depressed areas. We propose to use Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) data for the years 1996-2000 combined with detailed measures of local health care facilities to examine the link between local safety net characteristics and employer-provided health insurance. By surveying approximately 25,000 firms annually regarding the characteristics of their health insurance, the MEPS-IC provides an ideal means of examining how local health care safety net characteristics affect the willingness of firms to offer health insurance. The detailed measures, the consistency of measurement over time, and the sample size will allow us to explore not only how the health care safety net affects whether employers offer health insurance but also the effects on the attributes of offered health insurance. We have identified three primary benefits to Census Bureau from our research. First, related to understanding the quality of the data, our research will involve different means of measuring the extent and characteristics of health insurance provision by employers for different subgroups of employers. Second, related to potential improvements in the quality of the data, our project involves a new approach to measuring the substitution of privately provided health care for publicly provided health care. Third, our project will enhance the MEPS-IC data by adding information from other data sources on local safety-net measures.",1,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Anthony T Lo sasso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will investigate the extent to which greater detail in energy price aggregates and indices could be published, both in terms of confidentiality risks and whether there is sufficient variation to make this valuable. I will also perform an investigation of data quality and the measurement of technological change to deter-mine whether observed changes in energy efficiency are caused by a response to energy prices, as opposed to misreporting. This study will improve the Census Bureau’s knowledge base regarding manufacturers’ energy input values and the response of manufacturing production and technology to energy prices and use.  Estimates of cost functions for each industry will be used to calculate changes in energy productivity over time. This approach allows measurement of the effect of price-induced technical change on energy productivity by comparing the changes according to the industry’s initial energy intensity.

359,Completed,Financial Protection Provided by Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance,Washington,2004,2005.0,Roland D Mcdevitt,"Although large and small firms generally pay similar premiums for health insurance, it is widely believed that these premiums purchase less generous plans for small firms. This lower “actuarial value,” along with the lower wages paid by many small firms, may help to explain why many of them do not offer coverage and why many workers in these firms decline it when offered. The actuarial value of a plan is the percentage of medical expense that it will pay for a covered population. It allows us to compare the adequacy of coverage across plans and make value-adjusted comparisons of premiums. While an extensive literature monitors the prevalence of employer-sponsored health insurance across states and firm sizes, surprisingly little has been published about the actuarial value of this insurance and how it varies across states, firm sizes and plan types. This project will examine variations in the actuarial value and value-adjusted price of employer-sponsored health care benefits. It will also examine the financial protection that group insurance affords persons with differing levels of health care use. Finally, it will improve our understanding of why some employees decline to take-up coverage and why some employers don’t offer coverage, by adding the actuarial value of the health care benefit to the list of explanatory factors. The major study database is the Census Bureau’s 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Survey (MEPS-IC). AHRQ’s MEPS Household Survey will also be used together with Watson Wyatt software to simulate the payment of medical claims for a standard employer-sponsored population. Based on these simulations, an actuarial value will be calculated for each of the MEPS-IC health plans. Watson Wyatt, a leading actuarial and benefits consulting firm, will collaborate with the Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET) on this study. The study will produce statistical models and at least one journal article that explore these dynamics of job-based health insurance. This project will greatly enhance the MEPS-IC data by adding the actuarial value for each health plan. This proposal has been approved for a $180,000 grant from the Commonwealth Fund. In addition to evaluating and documenting inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPSIC health plan data, we will recommend recodes or imputations to address them. These recodes and imputations can be added to the MEPS-IC data for use by future researchers at the RDC. Watson Wyatt will estimate the actuarial value of each health plan in the MEPS-IC database. The result will be a “benefit rate” that represents the percentage of charges each plan would pay if that plan were offered to a standard population. We will also estimate the plan medical expense and beneficiary out-of-pocket expense for the top ten percent of users, the top 25 percent of users, the top 50 percent of users and the bottom 50 percent of users. These new variables will be required for the proposed project and they will be added to the MEPS-IC file for use by future researchers at the RDC. In the process of calculating the actuarial value for each plan, we will also evaluate and document any internal inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPS-IC plan data. Simulating the actuarial value of a plan is an excellent way to evaluate these data quality issues, because it requires comprehensive examination of plan provisions and the manner in which they interact. The addition of actuarial value to the MEPS-IC file will allow the calculation the mean actuarial value for the population of health plans offered by private sector firms. It will also allow us to profile the distribution of actuarial value of health plans at various points in the distribution. We will calculate these at the 90th percentile, the 75th percentile, the 50th percentile, the 25th percentile and the 10th percentile of actuarial value. We are also prepared to estimate other health plan population characteristics, including premiums, employer contributions, and health plan cost-sharing provisions.",1,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

362,Completed,The Industry Life-Cycle of the Size Distribution of Firms,Berkeley,2004,2005.0,Emin M Dinlersoz,"This project aims to provide the Census Bureau with a new set of stylized facts and statistics pertaining to the life-cycle behavior of the size distribution of firms in U.S. manufacturing industries. This goal will be achieved by analyzing the evolution of the size distribution of firms in an industry as the industry goes through its life cycle, i.e. different stages of growth. The size distribution of firms is intimately related to important industry aggregates, including inter-firm distribution of productivity, as well as to differences among firms in terms of production technology and product mix. Despite the importance of a comprehensive understanding of changes in the size distribution of firms in an industry over time, little has been done so far to uncover the nature of such changes. When all manufacturing firms are considered together, it is well known that the size distribution of firms, measured either by employment or value of output, is quite stable over time (see, e.g., Ijiri and Simon (1977), Sutton (1997), Axtell (2001)). However, theories of industry dynamics and finer industry level data (e.g., Gort and Klepper (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990)) suggest that this aggregate stability masks significant underlying inter-industry heterogeneity. As industries experience growth, shakeout, stability and decline phases, the size distribution of firms is predicted to exhibit significant changes. Models of industry life-cycle (e.g., Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994)) and empirical findings regarding firm and plant dynamics (e.g. Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1988, 1990)) collectively suggest that the size distribution is likely to be right skewed during the early phases of an industry, because initially most firms are small. As the industry grows and more entry occurs, the size distribution is expected to shift to the left and become even more right skewed, since most entering firms are small. Correspondingly, when an industry experiences its shakeout phase, small firms are more likely to exit the industry and the importance of larger firms in the size distribution increases. Thus, we expect to observe a decline in the skewness of firm size and rightward shift in firm size distribution. These general predictions, not to mention other, more detailed, hypotheses based on specifics of particular models of industry evolution, have not been tested before. The prevalence of these patterns across different industries, and even whether any generalizations are possible, is ultimately an empirical question. Our goals are to provide a comprehensive documentation of the evolution of the size distribution, and to establish a link between the patterns observed and theories of industry dynamics and evolution. The empirical analysis in this project requires observations on alternative measures of firm size for all firms over several time periods and across narrowly defined industries. Unfortunately, no public dataset meets these criteria simultaneously: measures of firm size at the individual firm level are not publicly available for a comprehensive set of industries and time periods. Publicly available datasets only provide information about plant size, as opposed to firm size. Furthermore, plant size information is in the form of discrete size ranges, as opposed to individual observations. Finally, the only measure of plant size in public data is employment, which is not the ideal measure from a theoretical point of view. We therefore propose to use the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) and the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) for the analysis of firm size distribution. Since the nature of the analysis is dynamic, the data for all available years (1963, 1967, and for each year between 1972 and 2002) will be utilized, subject to availability. The size distribution of firms will be constructed for each 4-digit industry. The LRD and the ASM provide several measures of firm size, such as employment, output and sales, which will be obtained by aggregating the corresponding size measures provided for all the plants of a firm. This firm level information will be aggregated to a size distribution, and to statistics that describe the distribution of firm size, e.g., skewness, variance, and kurtosis. The evolution of these statistics will be investigated using a variety of statistical and econometric procedures. The life-cycle analysis benefits the Census Bureau programs by providing a new set of statistics and stylized facts on the evolution of the size distribution. Several new population estimates will be obtained for firms and industries in the LRD database as a result of the statistical analysis we plan to carry out. The project will help understand and evaluate the quality and relevance of the different measures of firm size, a subject on which theory, thus far, has not been informative. This will in turn assist the Census Bureau in development of more useful questions pertaining to size of an establishment in future surveys. Simultaneously utilizing the confidential data in the LRD and the publicly available NBER/CES Manufacturing Productivity Database and the County Business Patterns (CBP) Database will provide an independent way of validating the quality of data in the NBER Productivity Database and CBP Database at the industry level.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Emin M Dinlersoz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
364,Completed,The Effect of Local Demand Shocks on Labor Market Outcomes: A Natural Experiment in the Aircraft Manufacturing Industry,Washington,2005,2006.0,Keenan M Dworak-Fisher,"In this study, we prepare estimates of population measuring the effects of local labor demand shocks on the labor market outcomes and geographic migration of U.S. workers. To do so, we generate a valuable new set of geographic delineations that are consistently defined across the 1990–2000 decade in five states. Within these delineations, we create estimates of how labor market and demographic characteristics of the resident populations changed over the decade. To generate our estimates of labor market behavior, we exploit a natural experiment in the aircraft manufacturing industry during the 1990s: a variety of plausibly exogenous factors that combined to severely diminish aircraft manufacturing in several localities, creating local labor demand shocks. Due to the end of the Cold War, a recession, and a glut in the commercial aircraft market, employment in this industry fell by 25 percent between 1989 and 1999, with the decline concentrated early in the decade. In a related development, the industry also restructured during this decade; consolidations borne out of a need to maintain minimum economies of scale caused some localities to be especially hard-hit by the decline. At the same time, increased competition in the industry led to the increased adoption of lean production technologies that diminished employment in traditional aircraft manufacturing further. Because the aircraft manufacturing industry is so large, it comprises a significant proportion of employment in several areas where it experienced these severe declines. We generate our estimates of the labor market behavior populations by examining the changes of various population characteristics in these localities. We use our estimates of population characteristics within our newly defined geographic units to perform this analysis. 
We will use data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses of Population, including geographic detail, to construct indexes measuring how wages, employment rates, and population changed over the 1990s within narrowly defined geographic areas, while controlling for demographic compositions of the areas. We match these indexes up with measures of changes in overall job availability in the areas based on publicly available data from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS). We use this linked database to estimate reduced form equations measuring the elasticities of wage, employment rate, and population of various demographic groups and sectors to the labor demand shock caused by aircraft manufacturing’s decline. This research will create a valuable intermediate product: a database of Census Bureau data that is linked across time through consistently defined geographic designations and linked with establishment-based measures of employment. This database will provide a useful tool for the improvement of data quality via improved sensitivity checks for data review, additional inputs to imputation for nonresponse, and establishment-based checks on employment information by place-of work that could be used in a benchmarking procedure. In addition, our research into creating geographic links and examining their use in the study of local labor markets will provide a valuable tool for evaluating the labor market designations created by the Census Bureau. The database will also provide an alternative starting point for future research involving geographic detail.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Keenan M Dworak-Fisher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
365,Completed,Competition and Industry Structure in Food Services,Chicago,2004,2007.0,Clarissa A Yeap,"This project will study the linkages among price competition, non-price competition and industry structure in the food services industry. Using information on revenues, prices and non-price product attributes, it will provide direct empirical evidence of how firms’ prices and product choice are related to each other and to industry structure. This will shed light on how firms compete in industries with many firms and heterogeneous products, typical characteristics of the growing services sector. It will add to the knowledge of how markets work by revealing some of the feedback mechanisms between structure and conduct in such markets. The primary dataset will be firm-level microdata for food services establishments from the Economic Census in 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997. I will use the information on revenues, prices and product attributes from this dataset to analyze how firms compete in prices and non-price characteristics and to relate market structure to the competitiveness of industry. The analysis will consist mostly of statistical tests and estimation techniques to study the relationships between these variables. Therefore, the output will largely be regression estimates and aggregate statistics. I will work closely with Census staff to avoid inappropriate disclosure. Other datasets to be used in this study are the Business Expenditures Survey (BES), Assets and Expenditures Survey (AES), County Business Patterns (CPB), Country and City Data Books (CCDB), the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) in 1971-1997, where each is available. I will use firm-level operating expenses data from the BES, AES and CPB to control for variation in costs across firms and market-level data to control for variation in costs across markets. The CCDB will provide demographic information to account for variation in tastes across markets. The SSEL contains firm identifiers, name and address files that I will use to track affiliation among establishments. The LBD contains firm identifiers that will help to link the data across years for longitudinal analysis.
This project’s main benefit to the Census will be to provide an evaluation of the quality of the microdata for the food services industry. This will enhance the Census’ understanding of the dataset and provide guidance for improvements to its surveys. Specifically, this project will assess the quality of the data with regard to non-responses, characterize the extent of imputed data, and document higher moments and other statistical characteristics of the distribution of key variables. Furthermore, it will verify the internal consistency of the data and provide the Census with a cleaned and documented dataset that may be useful to other researchers. The proposed project will also enhance the Census microdata by developing links to market-level costs data in the BES and CPB, and to market-level population and household demographics in the CCDB. In addition, for a subset of establishments, it will link the Census microdata to firm-level operating expenses information in the BES. The resulting dataset will contain rich information on costs, prices, product choice and revenues for individual firms. Finally, the project may also provide links over time for these data for longitudinal analysis. Another benefit that will come from this project is the preparation of estimates of several characteristics of the food services establishment population. Estimates of the correlation among prices, product attributes, ownership structure, demand characteristics and costs will enhance the Census’ understanding of how these variables are related in this industry. These estimates will be provided at the market and establishment levels.",5,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Ali Hortacsu,Thomas Hubbard,Chad W Syverson,Clarissa A Yeap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
369,Completed,Capital Reallocation,Chicago,2003,2008.0,Andrea L Eisfeldt,"This project will study capital reallocation and the liquidity of real assets. Using COMPUSTAT data, we have shown that the amount of capital reallocation is procyclical. In contrast the benefits to capital reallocation appear countercyclical. We find that a counter cyclical process for capital illiquidity can reconcile these series and discuss possible sources of this illiquidity. Our project will build on and extend our previous work. We propose to study the cyclical properties of capital reallocation and capital illiquidity, understand the nature of capital illiquidity, understand the role of used capital markets in firm dynamics, and construct stylized facts describing firm heterogeneity including the cyclical properties of dispersion in productivity, capacity utilization and investment opportunities across firms. This research project on measuring capital reallocation has as its predominant purpose (I) to further the understanding and improve the quality of the data, (ii) to improve the methodology for measurement, and (iii) to prepare estimates of characteristics of the population. By measuring capital at the establishment or firm level and the reallocation of capital (i.e., sale or purchases of capital) across establishments or firms and by comparing the findings from the non-public data to our findings using COMPUSTAT data, the project will further the understanding of the quality of the data and improve the quality of the data. In addition, by documenting what can be learned from the existing data from the ASM/CM and ACES about the reallocation of capital, the project should lead to new or improved methodology to collect data to measure capital and its redeployment in different use. The benefits should compare to the productive interaction between the measurement of labor reallocation by Davis, Haltiwanger and coauthors and the data collection by the Bureau of the Census. The project will result in estimates of population and characteristics of population such as an aggregate capital reallocation series and documentation of its cyclical properties. Furthermore, the project will prepare estimates of dispersion measures of productivity across firms as well as the dynamics of heterogeneity across firms, an important feature of the microdata which has not been sufficiently studied.",6,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Olesya N Baker,Philip S Doctor,Andrea L Eisfeldt,Adriano A Rampini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
378,Completed,Economic Integration and Labor Demand Elasticities,Washington,2004,2007.0,Mine Z Senses,"This study intends to examine the effects of increased economic integration on labor demand elasticities of skilled and unskilled labor, focusing on the effects of international trade, specifically outsourcing, as well as increased capital flows. Rodrik (1997) suggests that increased possibility of substituting domestic labor with its foreign counterparts through outsourcing and foreign direct investment should make labor demand more elastic. Greater product markets competition is also likely to flatten the labor demand curve. More intense competition in the final goods market is observed due to decline in trade protection and entry of less developed nations into production in manufacturing sector as a result of increased transmission of technology worldwide. The validity of the Rodrik hypothesis will be tested for the US manufacturing sector using plant-level data from the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufacturers for 1972 to 2001. This project will increase the Census Bureau’s knowledge base through the estimation of labor demand elasticities and the impact of economic integration upon these estimated elasticities over the 1972-2001 period for establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufacturers. A second benefit of this project will be understanding and/or improving the quality of data produced, by attempting to identify possible directions and magnitudes of the biases in the estimated coefficients resulting from the inclusion of imputed variables. I also intend to compile a summary of information regarding imputations throughout the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufacturers in order to assist further research using this dataset. Final benefit of this study to the Census Bureau will be enhancing the data collected, by improving imputations for non-response. I will identify possible problems with the imputation techniques used regarding the usage of prior survey information on payroll and employment to predict currently unavailable data, in conjunction with current year BLS aggregates.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Jim A Levinsohn,Mine Z Senses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
381,Completed,The impact of banking market structure on the life-cycle dynamics of non-financial industries,Baruch,2006,2010.0,Nicola Cetorelli,"This project explores the effect of banking market structure on the market structure and growth of nonfinancial industries. It asks whether concentration in the banking market promotes the formation of industries constituted by a few, large firms, or, rather, whether it facilitates the continuous entry of new firms, thus maintaining unconcentrated market structures across industries. Theoretical arguments could be made to support either hypothetical scenario. Further, it looks at the impact of banking market structure on employment growth, new firm entry, and establishment exit rates. Empirical evidence will be derived merging the panel information contained in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) with that on the banking industry contained in the publicly available Commercial Bank Report on Condition and Income of the Federal Reserve System. This project will evaluate the quality of the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate census, and LBD data in two ways: 1) by assessing missing items, imputations, and inequalities; and 2) by comparing it to the Commercial Bank and Holding Company Database compiled by the Federal Reserve.",3,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Nicola Cetorelli,Atif R Mian,Anna M Peterson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
382,Completed,Understanding the Behavior of Job Flows over the Business Cycle,Washington,2004,2006.0,John A Figura,"The project I am proposing will contribute in four ways to the understanding and improvement of Census data: first, it will develop filtering and flagging programs, which will identify unusual and potentially spurious observations for plants in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM). Second, it will also estimate or impute data for missing observations or observations deemed likely to be spurious. Third, because the project estimates population moments from relatively long panels of plants, it will further the understanding of the representativeness and usefulness of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. Finally, the project will further the understanding of the dynamic behavior of plants, in particular their demand for labor. In this regard, the project proposes to answer two sets of questions related to the behavior of plant level employment: (1) do plants time their restructuring activities to correspond with fluctuations in the business cycle and if so, which types of plants are more likely to do so, and (2) are there asymmetric movements in job flows at the plant level and do these plant-level asymmetric movements, if they exist, translate into asymmetric job flow movements at the aggregate level. Answering these questions requires the construction of panels of plants from the ASM, with panels grouped by relevant plant characteristics, such as size and industry. To prevent spurious data from contaminating results, I will filter out or flag unusual patterns in plants’ time series of characteristics as well as impute data that is either missing or appears spurious. To appropriately interpret my results, I will compare characteristics of plants from my longitudinal samples to the overall ASM, evaluating the representativeness, and hence the usefulness, of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. The data sets I will need are the ASM from 1972 to the most recent available and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) from 1967 to the most recent available. Considerable processing of this data has already been performed in the construction of data files for the Gross Flows project. Thus, I would also like to have access to many of the files constructed from the ASM and the CM in the Gross Flows project.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
387,Completed,Measuring Geographic Differences in Technical Change in the US Manufacturing Sector,Boston,2004,2007.0,Ethan G Lewis,"Evidence on the use of personal computers strongly suggests that the adoption of new technologies has occurred at a much faster pace in some parts of the US than in others, and that this is causally influenced by the skills of the local work force. If technology use and implementation differs substantially by US region, it would be of interest to decision-makers and researchers to have statistics that document these regional differences. It would also be of value to the Census Bureau to have regionally representative micro data on the use of technology. This paper proposes to use the Surveys of Manufacturing Technology (1988, 1991, 1993) to generate a new publicly available aggregate data series: tabulated statistics representative of manufacturing employment and establishments by state and by major metropolitan area on the prevalence and reasons for use of advanced manufacturing technologies. In addition, two sets of sample weights which will allow future users of the SMT micro data to construct statistics that are representative of manufacturing establishments or employment in arbitrary U.S. regions (comprised of counties or states) will be constructed through a match to establishment universe data in the County Business Patterns county and state summary files (1988, 1991, 1993) and Censuses of Manufacturers (CM) (1987, 1992) by sample strata and region. Employment representative weights will also be constructed through a CM-SMT match by establishment id. The matches will also be used to investigate the geographic representativeness of the SMT, and a report with recommendations for the design of future technology surveys, including the possibility of geographic stratification, will be written. Developing new ways of presenting statistical data to the public, creating sample weights, verifying sample frame and documenting new data collection needs each constitute benefits to the Census Bureau under Title 13, Chapter 5. The project will use the regionally representative technology data to investigate the extent to which local work force skills affect technology use and worker productivity (wages). To do so, the prevalence of different technologies will be regressed on local work force characteristics as measured in public use survey data (Censuses of Population and Current Population Surveys) across metropolitan areas. For the purpose of causal inference, instrumental variables regressions will be estimated using instruments for the skills of the local work force developed from the tendency of immigrants from different parts of the world to settle in particular US labor markets. In order to estimate the impact of any technological response on productivity, production functions that include particular technologies and local work force skills will be estimated. Manufacturers’ reports of the benefits (e.g. improve product quality) and costs (e.g. costs of training workers) of technology will also be assessed as channels through which the skills of the local work force operate to affect technological change.",2,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

391,Completed,How Does Space Matter in Ethnic Labor Market Segmentation?,Triangle,2004,2005.0,Qingfang Wang,"This study will examine the spatial influences on ethnic labor market segmentation, viz. how the locations of workers’ residences and workplaces influence the emergence of ethnic niche occupations. It argues that human and social capital is built through particular spatial arrangements, and that residential and workplace locations can act to inhibit occupational choices. The study will use the confidential Census data derived from the Decennial Long Form 2000 to conduct a case study of Chinese in the San Francisco CMSA. The study has three objectives: (i) to examine the ethnic segmentation of San Francisco’s labor market and identify Chinese niche sectors; (ii) to identify Chinese residential and workplace concentrations, and examine the social and economic characteristics of these concentrations; and (iii) to evaluate how the geography of home and work influences the emergence of Chinese occupational niches. This project will contribute to the Census Bureau by improving the accuracy and reducing the costs of conducting the census. Three specific contributions can be mentioned. First, by identifying the many Chinese enclaves and examining the unique social and economic characteristics of each, the study will aid the preparation of estimates and characteristics of the Chinese population and minimize the problems of missed and inaccurately represented subpopulations during sampling. Second, this study will help the Census Bureau to design and appropriately target bilingual forms, provide telephone assistance and the telephone self-response options. By identifying and mapping both the residential locations and workplace locations of workers at census tract level, this study can facilitate the success of follow-up surveys and help reduce under/over counts. Finally, this study will help the Census Bureau in the development of a pilot study to over-sample the Asian population for Census 2010. For example, the results can be used to assess whether better estimates are to be gained from oversampling areas with high concentrations of the target (Chinese) population, or by over-sampling across a larger geographic area, albeit with smaller concentrations of the target population. The geographic patterns of Chinese concentrations can be correlated with patterns and rates of mail response to Census questionnaires to assess response rates. These benefits will help further the recommendations made by the Census Advisory Committee on the Asian Populations made as a result of the meeting on May 1, 2002.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Qingfang Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
392,Completed,An Empirical Assessment of the Value of Electronic Integration in the Manufacturing Sector,Michigan,2006,2010.0,Nigel Melville,"Manufacturers are increasingly using the Internet to electronically integrate their business processes internally and across their network of trading partners. However, due to a lack of available data sources, information about the adoption and economic impact of Internet business practices is limited. The proposed study seeks to address this shortcoming by analyzing a dataset containing 39 measures of computer net-work use within U.S. manufacturing plants collected within the Computer Network Use Supplement (CNUS) to the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM).  Additional datasets employed provide data on plant characteristics and efficiency for a period of multiple years prior to and beyond the CNUS year (1999), including the Census of Manufactures and the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization. The sample of establishments responding to the CNUS accounts for roughly 50 percent of all manufacturing employment and salaries and 95 per-cent of online manufacturing cost of materials, with substantial variation in response rate by geography and plant size. Given that there may be systematic differences between respondents and nonrespondents, three approaches will be used to examine nonresponse bias. First, known differences in the samples (ASM characteristics such as value of shipments and employees) will be examined. For example, if CNUS respondents tend to be from plants that are on average 10 percent larger, I can estimate the nonresponse bias by estimating the impact of a 10 percent change in plant size on CNUS variables. Second, I will compare measures from an independent survey with those of the CNUS survey. Third, I will compare the response rate to an ASM question on the value of e-shipments as a percentage of all shipments with measures collected within the CNUS, as well as the profile of responding plants to the ASM question versus the CNUS question. Regarding parameter estimates, innovation variables will be computed using the 39 dichotomous items available from the CNUS.",7,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
395,Completed,Wages and the Organization of Human Capital:  Legal Services 1977-1997,Chicago,2004,2007.0,Thomas Hubbard,"The purpose of this proposal is to examine the quality of the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 Census of Services data for legal services firms on payroll by occupation, to determine whether one can combine revenue and payroll data to infer partner compensation, and to assess whether the manner in which the Bureau collects the occupation and payroll data produces distorted estimates in its publications. We then plan to use the Census microdata to investigate how the organization of legal services – in particular, firms’ hierarchical structure – has changed over time, characterize the distribution of wages in this industry and how it has changed over time, and analyze relationships between changes in hierarchies and changes in the wage distribution. The latter will lead to a better understanding of wage inequality not only in legal services, but in human-capital-intensive sectors (such as services) more broadly. The project will benefit Census programs in several ways. First, the project centers around the payroll by occupation data, which to our knowledge have not been used by CES staff. In the course of our project, we will learn the strengths and weaknesses of these data and communicate them to Census staff. These data have the potential to be a valuable resource to researchers investigating wage inequality, but if the responses to current questions are low-quality, the questions should either be changed or discontinued. Second, the Census has published estimates of the number of partners and associate lawyers for the U.S. and for select MSAs in recent Census years except 1997. These estimates have been somewhat misleading because they are based on definitions of “partners” and “associates” that differ from conventional uses of these terms in the industry. We plan to assess the magnitude of the distortion this produces, and create alternative estimates that are based on conventional definitions of “partners” and “associates.” Third, we would enhance the data we work with in two ways. We would link them over time, and provide alternative estimates of the number of partners and associates at each individual establishment in our data. These augmented datasets would be available to Census researchers.",4,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Services,CSR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Paul S Heaton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
396,Completed,Economic Strategies of Survival and Mobility:  Ethnic Entrepreneurship in the United States,Michigan,2004,2006.0,Zulema Valdez,"What is the effect of ethnicity on entrepreneurial activity? The neo-classical perspective suggests that human capital, defined as education and work experience, explains entrepreneurial outcomes regardless of ethnicity. The ethnic entrepreneurship approach argues that ethnicity provides social capital, such as reciprocal obligations, which facilitates enterprise. Drawing on economic sociology, this study combines the human capital and ethnic entrepreneurship approaches by introducing a framework derived from Polanyi (1944). Following Polanyi, this research argues that societies are constituted by three forms of market integration: market-exchange, reciprocity, and redistribution. Under capitalism, the market-exchange relationship is the dominant form of economic integration. Secondary relationships of reciprocity and redistribution, however, exist alongside the primary exchange relationship and provide compensatory support in the face of market uncertainty or disadvantage. Using the 1990 and 2000 US Census and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners, this study proposes to examine the effects of primary and secondary relationships of market integration on entrepreneurial participation and economic success. This research provides evidence that reciprocal relationships, which generate social capital, contribute to an explanation of entrepreneurial participation. Yet, findings reveal that market-exchange relationships, constituted in part by human capital or class background, better explain entrepreneurial economic success, regardless of ethnicity. The analysis of the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners Survey will benefit the US Census Bureau in two ways. First, this proposed analysis will construct, verify, and improve the sampling frame for future Census and CBO (SBO) data collection. Second, this proposed analysis would provide estimates of a variety of understudied ethnic and racial group populations and characteristics of these populations.",2,Decennial Census,CEN,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Zulema Valdez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
401,Completed,The Financial Assimilation of Immigrants,Chicago,2006,2011.0,Anna Paulson,"While most discussions of immigrant assimilation focus on labor and housing markets, immigrant participation in financial markets is a critical and largely unstudied dimension of economic assimilation.  The degree to which immigrants assimilate into the financial mainstream has profound implications for the U.S. economy. This project will provide new evidence on the extent of immigrant participation in financial markets and the key determinants of financial assimilation. The aspects of financial assimilation that will be studied include use of checking and savings accounts, participation in the stock market, and investment in risky vs. “safe” assets. The analysis will be based on data from the Survey of Income Program and Participation (SIPP). These data will be supplemented with characteristics of the countries of origin and with data on the destination communities. The predominant purpose of this project is to benefit the U.S. Census Bureau’s program, and it will do so in at least three ways. First, this study will com-pare SIPP data on immigrant year of arrival and country of origin to comparable data from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. Second, this study will analyze the factors that account for the higher attrition rate of immigrants relative to the native born in the SIPP panel.

406,Completed,Hedonic Models of Real Estate and Labor Markets,Chicago,2007,2012.0,Bhashkar Mazumder,"The proposed research program will develop and implement methods to estimate hedonic price supply and demand models applied to two important classes of empirical economic issues where hedonic models are applicable, real estate and labor markets. Since these models include attributes that are highly location specific, this project will also develop and implement methods to link the micro-observations of Census Bureau datasets to micro-observations of other Census Bureau datasets and to external datasets. This linkage will be based on locations of the micro-observations, i.e., their physical geospatial proximity with each other, and will be performed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These two activities, development of hedonic prices and geospatial linking, form the principal benefits to the Census Bureau. In addition, through the application of these models to specific topics of interest, we will also generate bene-fits to specific Census Bureau surveys, such as the American Housing Survey and other surveys used through the course of the project. In order to apply hedonic models to study location issues, datasets containing highly detailed geographic information and robust methods for establishing the geospatial relationships are required. The project will use GIS modeling tools to create the necessary statistical measures of collocation that will enable us to examine specific topics using the hedonic approach. In addition, part of the proposed research will develop new methodological approaches that address some of the theoretical and empirical shortcomings with the classical hedonic model. The topics that will be studied in this project include: an analysis of residential real estate markets; an analysis of school quality, education, location, and neighborhood effects; commercial real estate markets and community economic development; and a hedonic analysis of labor markets.  This research program is focused not only on developing the data sources and tools needed to apply the hedonic approach to these questions but also on testing our progress with a series of interrelated topical studies that focus on some of these aspects. While the longer term goal is a more integrated assessment of the hedonic values across all of these factors, we begin with examining several more “manageable” sized research topics in this general area by incrementally developing the data and tools needed to measure the aforementioned community factors and estimate the hedonic prices associated with them. In doing so we also expect to address some important social science research questions with better data and better methodology.",22,American Housing Survey,AHS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Decennial Census,CEN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Decennial Employer-Employee Database,DEE,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2004,LEHD-BRB-2004,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2004,LEHD-ECF-2004,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2004,LEHD-GAL-2004,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,Survey of Income and Program Participation - Longitudinal,SIP-LON,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,Valeska A Araujo,Gale A Boyd,Nathan Chan,Matthew L Freedman,Ryan M Gallagher,Rachel Goodell,Timothy L Hamilton,Tatyana V Kuzmenko,Corey Lang,Frank F Limehouse,Xiangping Liu,Thomas C Maslin,Ralph A Mastromonaco,Rosa L Matzkin,Monica C McInerney Wood,Sara Murray,Joseph Persky,Daniel J Phaneuf,Laura O Taylor,Gary A Thompson,Christopher Timmins,Nurgul Ukueva,Ryan K Vaughn,,,,,,,,,,,
410,Completed,Temporary Help Industry and Local Market Conditions,Chicago,2005,2010.0,Yukako Ono,"The Help Supply Industry (SIC 7363) has been one of the fastest growing industries in the U.S. economy. It includes both Temporary Help Services (THS) establishments, which supply workers to client firms on a temporary basis, and Employee Leasing Services (ELS) establishments, which supply workers to client firms on a longer-term basis. Research on the industry has been growing because of the important role it is thought to have had in increasing labor market flexibility by efficiently matching workers and employers (e.g., Segal and Sullivan, 1995, 1997; Golden, 1996; Ono and Zelenev, 2003). However, the rapid growth of the Help Supply Industry also presents challenges for statistical agencies and the researchers who use their data. One concern is that while the workers supplied by THS and ELS establishments are under the direct supervision of the client firm, they are on the payroll of the Help Supply establishments. Thus, they are not counted in the employment totals of the industries in which they perform their work. This can make standard estimates of labor productivity misleading for industries that utilize help supply workers. In addition, most research interest is in the role of THS firms in improving the functioning of labor markets, but most available data do not distinguish between THS and ELS employment. This is a concern because ELS firms, which typically take on the payroll of an existing workforce and have little role in the recruitment of workers, are unlikely to play the same important labor market intermediation role as THS firms. This project will increase the U.S. Census Bureau’s knowledge base about the relevant issues surrounding the Help Supply Industry. Given recent growth in this industry and its likely impact on the productivity and investment decisions of firms outside the industry (the client firms), this information is extremely important for evaluating Census Bureau’s collection and tabulation of employment data. To examine these issues, this project will extend our previous work (Ono and Zelenev, 2003; Segal and Sullivan, 1995, 1997) with micro-level analyses of firms’ use of temporary labor and the industrial organization of the THS industry. First, by using the 1997 and 2002 Business Expenditure Survey (BES) and Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (PCU), we will analyze the extent to which THS usage buffers fluctuations in client firms’ regular employment. We will also examine whether the use of THS is increased by greater competition among THS agencies. Next, by using the Census of Services and Longitudinal Business Database, we will study whether THS agencies are attracted to local markets with more volatile industrial structures, using the method employed in Ono and Zelenev (2003). We then will examine whether the entry of THS agencies reduces the markup they charge client firms for supplying workers. Finally, we will study the role of temporary help services in the particularly important market for temporary nurses. This proposal will further benefit Census programs by using Census micro data to address data quality issues and to create documentation that will benefit the Census Bureau by increasing understanding of current problems in the data as well as by improving future data collection efforts. In particular, we will contribute to the development of methods to improve the separate estimation of the number of ELS and THS workers employed by each industry in each geographic area. This will require use of the economic census and the BES. We will also develop methods to incorporate the inputs of THS and ELS workers in estimates of industry level labor productivity in manufacturing. This will require use of the PCU, as well as other census datasets.",8,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Philip S Doctor,Andrew J Goodman-Bacon,Britton J Lombardi,Yukako Ono,Daniel G Sullivan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
412,Completed,US Minority Migration and Metropolitan Change,Michigan,2004,2008.0,William H Frey,"The project seeks to evaluate race-ethnic selective migration processes in the US and their impacts on large metropolitan areas. It will employ the “residence 5 years ago” question for successive censuses to determine if immigration and internal migration processes are leading to greater dispersion of the nation’s detailed race-and ethnic groups across metropolitan areas. It will also evaluate the consistency and accuracy of “residence 5 years ago” responses over time for race-ethnic groups. The project will use the Michigan RDC to analyze census long form data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. If it becomes available during the course of this project, the analysis will also incorporate data from the 1980 Census. The concentration of Hispanic and Asian populations in New York, Los Angeles, and a few other large metropolitan areas is related to their recent immigrant status and attachments to co-ethnic communities in those areas. (Liaw and Frey, 1998; Gober, 2000,Waldinger, 2001). Yet, recent Census 2000 results suggest their greater geographic dispersal (Frey, 2002c, Suro and Singer, 2002). The African-American population, while less concentrated than these groups, has shown an increased tendency to relocate in the South countering a long-standing movement in the reverse direction (Frey 2001b). Using a variety of demographic techniques, and migration models , we will assess the extent to which migration processes are leading to even further dispersal of race-ethnic groups by examining inter-metropolitan migration across the nation’s large metropolitan areas over the periods, 1985-90, 1995-2000 (and if data become available during this project), 1975-80. The proposed migration research will benefit the Census Bureau’s Population Division by: providing information relevant to the quality, possible new tabulations, imputations and additional collection needs of race-ethnic data based on the decennial census “residence 5 years ago” question as it applies to different facets of the Division’s work on migration and race/ethnic identification, and subnational population estimates and projections. To this end, the migration analyses will focus on identifying heterogeneity of migration patterns for specific race and ethnic groups (or combinations thereof) within the broad race and ethnic groups that are usually included in the full sample release of migration information in standard Census summary files, publications, and in their estimation and projection models. The above analyses will shed light on data quality and measurement issues. For example, the comparison of one race alone (e.g.. whites) migration patterns with those for that race in combination with others (e.g., whites in combinations with others) in 2000, and for that race in 1990 will shed light on the utility of using the former as a proxy for a given race, when comparing patterns over time. Our migration models which include parameters for nativity, and year of entry can also inform the Census Bureau’s post-censal estimate and projection procedures which incorporate race—ethnic specific migration assumptions.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,William H Frey,Chang-cherng Sun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
413,Completed,Rural Entrepreneurs and the Survival and Growth of Rural Entrepreneurial Firms,Chicago,2005,2008.0,Jason R Henderson," 
Although entrepreneurship is a vital source of economic growth, information on rural entrepreneurship is sparse. The lack of rural entrepreneurship information leaves rural stakeholders dependent on statistics that may not reflect rural entrepreneurial activity. For example, do published Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey statistics accurately reflect rural entrepreneurship activity? Does rural entrepreneurship differ from nonrural entrepreneurship? If so, does U.S. Census Bureau data accurately reflect the rural component of entrepreneurship, or does rural response idiosyncrasies lead to systematic bias in published data? 
This proposal will first analyze such potential bias in Census Bureau statistics, then explore the development of new methodologies that the Census Bureau could use to publish new statistics on rural entrepreneurship. Rural will be defined in two ways: places with less than 2,500 people and as nonmetropolitan areas. 
The project’s first stage will analyze the factors contributing to the success and growth of new firms in rural and nonrural locations. The result will be a better understanding of how firm success is affected by the characteristics of individual entrepreneurs, by the characteristics of the firms they form, and by the communities in which businesses are located. If the factors contributing to firm success differ by rural/nonrural location, rural entrepreneurship is indeed different than metro entrepreneurship, and Census Bureau statistics could be biased if rural firms are under- or overrepresented in summary statistics. By using both urban/rural and metro/nonmetro definitions, the use of the metro/nonmetro definition as a proxy for the urban/rural definition can be explored. 
The second stage of the analysis will develop a methodology that could be used to publish new statistics on entrepreneurship from the Census Bureau. At the national level, entrepreneurship has been clearly demonstrated to be a vital source of economic growth. The lack of entrepreneurship data at sub-national level limits the ability to study the relationship between entrepreneurship and regional economic growth. An entrepreneurship index that satisfies Census Bureau disclosure requirements will be developed for various geographic regions. Entrepreneurship is a multifaceted concept that cannot be characterized by business starts alone, further justifying the development of a broader index measure. All project results will be made publicly available, subject to Census Bureau disclosure rules. 
This proposal will use the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from 1976 to current, the 1992 CBO Survey, and the 1992 Survey of Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises (SMWOBE) as the basis for the analysis. The proposal requests the use of the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SEEL) to explore rural/nonrural responses/nonresponse bias. 2002 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) data are also requested if they become available prior to proposal termination. The CBO, SMWOBE, and LBD will be used to identify new firm start-ups, measure their growth, identify the individual and firm characteristics of rural entrepreneurs, and analyze the difference between rural and nonrural entrepreneurs. Moreover, the project will characterize nonresponse (item and respondent from the CBO and SMWOBE) specifically using information on rural/nonrural status. The methodologies and recommendations produced are expected to apply to the upcoming publications of the 2002 SBO.",4,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Non-Employer Business Register,NBR,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Jason R Henderson,Sean M Moore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
420,Completed,The Role of Information Technology in Production,UCLA,2004,2005.0,Kevin Caves,"Information technology (IT) plays a key role in theoretical explanations of economic trends, which are the subject of some of the more important economic policy debates of our time. We propose to study the productive role of IT by matching data on computer use in the workplace from the Current Population Survey (CPS) with plant-level production data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). We plan to employ a new econometric technique for estimating production functions, which allows us to test whether IT affects plants’ total factor productivity (TFP), in addition to allowing for tests of whether IT causes information to flow more efficiently through firms. An important objective of this study will be to prepare estimates of production function parameters and TFP for the manufacturing industries using a new technique, which is designed to produce more accurate estimates than older methods. As we explain in the Project Description and in the Predominant Purpose Statement, the accurate measurement of TFP is directly relevant to the Census Bureau’s stated mission. To study the role of IT in production, we plan to use information on IT usage from both the CPS and the LRD, two sources that are actually complementary to each other. These two surveys provide, among other things, conceptually distinct measures of IT adoption. The CES datasets required for estimation consist of the datasets that comprise the LRD: the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures. Because our techniques employ nonparametric econometrics, it will be vital to have as many observations as possible to ensure efficient production function parameter estimates. Therefore, we would request access to all years for which data is available for the LRD. (This would include the years 1963, 1967 and 1972-2001). Because we will often be making comparisons at the industry level to study the role of IT in the production process, we need to obtain data from as many industries as possible in order to make accurate inferences. Therefore, we would request access to data on all manufacturing industries. All additional data required for the project will be publicly available and would be supplied by the researchers. This includes data on the prices of inputs and outputs, which will be necessary to transform the nominal data from the LRD into real variables. For most years (1963-1996), data from the NBER-CES manufacturing productivity database will suffice. For subsequent years, it may be necessary to obtain the relevant price series directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Note that our methodology does not require us to observe input prices at the plant level. The other dataset we will employ is the public use version of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Questions on computer use are included in the following years of the CPS: 1984, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2001. Moreover, in several of the years listed above, the CPS asked respondents about the specific types of computer applications they used at work. We plan to make use of this data, in addition to CPS data on the industry classification and the relevant statistical weight of the respondents. We will match the CPS data with the LRD data using 3-digit industry codes.",2,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Daniel A Ackerberg,Kevin Caves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
422,Completed,Vertical Linkages and Investment Decisions,Chicago,2004,2007.0,Allan G Collard-Wexler,"This project will examine supplier-customer relationships (also known as vertical linkages) and the impact of these relationships on investment decisions. The Census Bureau has explicitly stated a need for “specific recommendations regarding how to better capture and describe supply chain activities in the 2002 Economic Census and in our current economic statistics” (Mesenbourg 2001). This project will develop a methodology to capture and describe these supply chain activities using internal Census economic microdata (Census of Manufacturing, Annual Survey of Manufacturing, Census of Construction, Longitudinal Business Database, Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization) combined with Input-Output Tables of the American Economy compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and will provide this methodology to Census. In addition, knowledge gained from these analyses will be used to address several data quality issues in these data sets (i.e., studying patterns of non-response, developing new imputation methods, conducting consistency checks). The project will then use these relationship measures to examine firms’ decisions to adopt electronic commerce infrastructure based on their suppliers’ and customers’ actions as well as to examine capital investment decisions by ready-mix concrete plants based on downstream local construction activity. Hence, this project will not only benefit the Census Bureau by producing a methodology to capture and describe these supply chains but will also provide knowledge useful for addressing a multitude of data quality issues. Vertical linkages between firms play an enormous role in the functioning of the economy. A large fraction of output from plants across the country is not consumed by individuals but is utilized in other firms’ production processes. These linkages are key to explaining investment behavior -- if a firm’s customers are growing rapidly, it is apt to expand its operations to meet future demand. The two applications chosen for this project, enumerated above, have a guiding methodological principle: the use of information about the relationships between firms, either sectors that trade with each other in the case of e-commerce or concrete plants that sell neighboring construction projects, to understand why firms make capital investments. Since both applications of these projects study firm-level decisions, non-public Census data are required. This project will primarily use data from the Longitudinal Research Database (i.e., the longitudinally linked conjunction of the Census of Manufacturing and the ASM) but will also use data from the Census of Construction, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization.",5,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Allan G Collard-Wexler,Kristina S Steffenson McElheran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
423,Completed,Workplace Hazards: Determinants and Economic Impacts,Boston,2006,2011.0,Wayne Gray,"This project combines U.S. Census Bureau data with external information on workplace hazards to benchmark data consistency at the plant level, to model the determinants of those hazards, and to see how they affect economic performance at manufacturing plants. The relationship of hazards and plant data as reported will be investigated to learn if negative shocks to production resulting from accidents or catastrophes are accurately reflected in the data. We also examine the determinants of workplace hazards, based on a model of a profit-maximizing plant choosing an optimal level of hazard abatement, given the pressures it faces. These pressures include the expected fine from being cited by an Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector for the workplace hazard. Unionization of the plant is expected to provide an incentive for hazard reduction, both from increasing worker knowledge about workplace hazards and from providing a framework in which to negotiate compensating wage differentials. Our models of wages, employment, investment, and productivity will help identify situations in which we would expect a plant’s economic variables to change dramatically (a new union contract or a new government safety regulation requiring substantial new investments), which we will compare to the time-series variation in the Census Bureau data that these external pressures are expected to influence. A better understanding of external factors (e.g., unionization and workplace hazards) influencing economic outcomes such as productivity will also be valuable to Census Bureau analysts and researchers to evaluate circumstances when data and estimate adjustments may be warranted due to temporary disruptions in plant production.",10,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2004,LEHD-BRB-2004,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2004,LEHD-ECF-2004,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures,PAC,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Jonathan M Lee,Laura O Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

429,Completed,Using Matched Employee Data to Examine Labor Market Dynamics and the Quality of DWS/CPS Data in California: 1991-2000,Berkeley,2003,2008.0,Andrew K Hildreth,"The project will link individual records for California residents in the Displaced Worker Supplements (DWS) (conducted in February 1994, February 1996, February 1998, and February 2000), with the March Current Population Survey files for 1991-2000 and the California Base Wage records 1991-2000. The proposed research seeks to address a number of issues in understanding how and why an individual loses their job using matched employee data. From the outset, the DWS was designed to elicit responses on the displacement of workers. Displacement was defined as being laid-off (without recall), a plant closing, or the employer going out of business. This is separate from a workers wish to quit or leave a job for their own reasons. As well as providing evidence on the accuracy of the DWS in measuring the cost of job displacement, there will be substantial scientific contributions and benefits to the Census Bureau from the work. We will conduct an assessment of the accuracy and shortcomings of the DWS in measuring the displacement of workers, of compiling displacement statistics, and measuring the cost of job loss. In particular, the scientific and bureau benefits are the following. First, the work will assess the importance of missing information on workers in the DWS. In particular, the work history and the measurement of wages can both be learned from the UI Base Wage files and their importance assessed. By including these two items into the DWS file, the analysis will be able to assess directly the importance of the missing information on job history, and the problems of reporting a retrospective wage for the last job for the displaced workers. Both of these items will impact how the wage change from displacement is estimated from the DWS. Second, assess the representative quality of the measurement of displacement against other sources of information. Matching the DWS to the UI Base Wage files, a more complete investigation is possible on the measurement of displacement from the ‘plant closed down’ response in the DWS. The UI Base Wage files can determine when a plant closed down through a change in the number of workers at a particular employer. This is will directly assess how researchers view the representative quality of the DWS in its estimate of displacement figures. As part of the Benefit to the Bureau, the research will provide technical memorandum describing the data base development and the differences between displacement statistics, pre and post displacement wages, and the reason for job loss. The technical memorandum will also address the implications for the Census Bureau’s data collection program. In particular, the usefulness of questions on displacement, the accuracy of recalling past wages, and the importance of missing information on the job loss between main employment spells.",2,CPS Crosswalk,CXW,Unemployment Insurance-Base Wage File -- California,UIW-CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Elizabeth W Handwerker,Andrew K Hildreth,Victor A Shlychkov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
434,Completed,The Behavior of Small and Large Firms over the Business Cycle,Chicago,2005,2010.0,Patrick J Kehoe," 
This proposal will examine the relative behavior of small and large firms over the business cycle. A widely held view is that monetary policy fluctuations play a central role in the business cycle and that these fluctuations affect small firms disproportionately. We plan to ask whether the data support this view. Furthermore, some researchers have argued that markups of prices over costs fluctuate systematically with the business cycle and that these fluctuations are tied to the size of firms. We plan to document the relationship between the cyclical properties of markups and the size of firms. 
This project will use the Longitudinal Research Database, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Quarterly Financial Reports, and the Enterprise Summary Report (ES9100) to obtain establishment- and firm-level information about sales, employment, value added, inventories, capital expenditures, the cost of materials, and ownership. These data will be compiled into a panel dataset of establishments and of the firms to which these establishments belong. For larger firms, we plan to link these data to data from Compustat® on the financial conditions of the firms, as well as to monetary policy indicators and other business cycle indicators. These will be examined for fluctuations over time and with respect to the business cycle. 
The predominant purpose of this proposal is to inform the U.S. Census Bureau about differences in behavior of small and large firms in varying economic climates. Hence, the project will prepare estimates of the population characteristics regarding the differential sensitivity of small and large firms to business cycles. These analyses will not only further the understanding of the quality of Census Bureau data for small vs. large firms, but could also lead to improvements in the methodology for collecting, measuring, or tabulating data in Title 13, Chapter 5 surveys and censuses.",8,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Enterprise Summary Report - ES9100 (large company),ESR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Lawrence Christiano,Joshua Davis,Matthias G Kehrig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

444,Completed,Learning By Doing In New Plants: An Investigation,UCLA,2005,2007.0,Natarajan N Balasubramanian,"This project aims to enhance the utility of Title 13, Chapter 5 data by (i) linking the LRD with a comprehensive dataset of US patents; (ii) identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs, specifically with regard to innovation; and (iii) preparing estimates of learning, ‘spillovers’ in learning, and the impact of technological advance on productivity not contained in existing publications.
This project will further the U.S. Census Bureau’s objectives regarding the collecting and analysis of information on productivity and technological innovation and address some of the associated issues. This project will link two extensively used datasets—the LRD and the NBER Patent Dataset, a comprehensive dataset of all U.S. patents granted between 1963 and 1999—and provide a much richer picture of technological innovation than what can be obtained using R&D expenditures alone, which is the only measure of technological innovation currently available at the Census Bureau. Specifically, the study will use the linked dataset to develop a number of descriptive statistics regarding patenting behavior along the lines of the NSF R&D survey and compare them with the aggregate statistics in the NSF R&D survey.
The productivity estimates obtained using output-based (i.e., patent-based) innovation variables are likely to be significantly different from that estimated using input-based measures such as R&D expenditure. By providing comparisons of these detailed productivity estimates with “plain-vanilla” estimates, the results of the study will highlight the need for improvements in the current R&D survey or the need for a new innovation survey.
This project will produce a number of estimates of characteristics of the population that are not contained in existing publications. These estimates will be developed with two objectives in view—(i) to assess the extent of potential bias in productivity estimates due to ignoring the impact of learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation; and (ii) to provide a better understanding of the sources of productivity growth by decomposing productivity growth into that caused by learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation.
Specifically, the project will develop regression estimates of “labor learning” and “capital learning” by industry. Second, the analytical results will provide, by industry where possible, estimates of “spillovers” in learning within firms and across different firms, including the variation in the magnitude of learning “spillovers” with geographical proximity and locational characteristics. Third, the study will provide estimates of productivity growth decomposed into components caused by technological innovation, by learning, and by the interaction of innovation and learning. Finally, the study will create estimates of productivity differences from learning between (a) “survivors” and “non-survivors” and (b) between new entrants and existing incumbents diversifying into new industries.",4,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Natarajan N Balasubramanian,Marvin B Lieberman,Jagadeesh M Sivadasan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
447,Completed,The Survival and Operation of Entrepreneurial Ventures,Chicago,2004,2008.0,Austan Goolsbee,"The purpose of this proposal is to improve the accuracy and quality of the ongoing Survey of Business Owners by helping distinguish true entrepreneurial ventures from individuals with small amounts of supplemental income and by addressing some of the difficulties arising from follow-up surveys of small firms that have gone out of business. It will do this by studying the economic determinants of the survival and operation of legitimate entrepreneurial ventures. The project will use information from the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) survey on the health and operation of businesses in 1992 and 1994 further matched to the establishment lists (SSEL) and, where possible, the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the future release of the Survey of Business Owners (SBO) to examine the survival and operation of entrepreneurs. It will look at two basic areas. The first is determining what economic factors influence the probability of survival for entrepreneurial firms. This will focus particularly on local credit conditions and local economic growth as well as on the influence of direct government support to entrepreneurs at the state and local level. The determinants of small firm survival are directly tied to the difficulties of follow-up activity required by the Census Bureau. The second is examining the impact of taxes (and some regulations) on the operation and offerings of the entrepreneurial firms. This will focus specifically on the subjects of how marginal income tax rates affect the hours that entrepreneurs choose to work on their businesses, how much income they report and the likelihood of hiring employees, as well as the role that they play on the likelihood that small businesses offer health insurance, pension plans, or medical leave to their workers, and to the probability that they operate the business out of the owner's home. Each of these subjects is correlated with a business being a true entrepreneurial venture (people with small amounts of supplemental income are unlikely to work long hours on the job, hire employees, offer health, pension or family leave, or move their businesses out of the home). The CBO, with its detailed micro level observations and ability to follow individuals across time even beyond the time frame of the survey by matching to the SSEL and the LBD, gives a unique opportunity to answer such questions. While the CBO is a sample of people with Schedule C income (as well as some partnerships), it avoids the typical problems of using tax return data by providing extensive information about the characteristics of the business owner, their background, and the like. This makes it the ideal basis for such a project.",4,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Austan Goolsbee,Jennifer M Paniza,Margaret M Triyana,Aleksey G Verkhivker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,Completed,Neighborhood Physical Form and Residential Satisfaction,Cornell,2005,2006.0,Yizhao N Yang,"The proposed research aims at testing whether and how the major components of neighborhood physical form—density, mixture in land use and housing, interconnectedness of street network—impose any systematic influence on residents’ perception and rating of their residential environment as a place to live, and how such influence would vary across household subgroups. It will employ multivariate statistic method to perform cross-sectional analyses. It will make use of the individual-level information from the publicly available 2002 metro-version American Housing Survey (AHS) data and neighborhood and community level social and physical measures derived from multiple data sources including the 2000 decennial census, the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP), and local parcel-based land use Geographic Information System (GIS) data. However, linking the AHS data to other datasets proposed to use in this research requires the census tract identifier, which is only available in the internal version of the AHS data. Given the current availability of the internal AHS datasets at the Center for Economic Studies (CES), the project proposes using the tract identifiers from the 1994/1995 internal AHS datasets for the 13 MSAs surveyed in the 2002 metro-AHS for the purpose of merging files. 
Funded in part by a dissertation research grant award by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the proposed research is anticipated to generate output that will not only inform policy makers but also benefit the U.S. Census Bureau in several areas. First, the proposed research will improve the understanding of the AHS data quality by conducting not only a careful examination of the AHS data itself but also an evaluation of the relationship between the AHS neighborhood measures and the neighborhood measures generated with other datasets. Second, analyses performed in this research will lead to potential improvement in data collection by identifying shortcomings in current AHS data collection and document new data collection needs, such as neighborhood attributes important to residential satisfaction but not currently surveyed in the AHS. Third, the resulting new dataset from merging the AHS with the neighborhood and community measures generated in this research will remain at the CES and be made available to other researchers. This new dataset will greatly enhance the utility of the AHS data in social science. And, fourth, the proposed research will yield summary statistics and coefficient estimates that go beyond those commonly released by the Census Bureau and enable a better understanding about Americans’ residential settings and residential experience.",1,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Yizhao N Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using longitudinal data, it will test two competing theories explaining the relationship between residential instability and crime rates in neighborhoods. I will also test whether the social capital in an area (embodied in social networks, voluntary organizations, and various other institutions) can ameliorate negative impacts on the neighborhood and prevent the downward spiral experienced by some neighborhoods. But to understand how neighborhoods change it is necessary to have an accurate measure of neighborhood quality. A key component of this study will be determining the usefulness of the subjective measures regarding neighborhood satisfaction, characteristics, and crime provided by respondents to the American Housing Survey (AHS) survey. I will combine a rich data set of measures culled from official sources with the AHS subjective responses in 21 metro areas as well as the three national neighbors subsamples (from 1985, 89, and 93). I am collecting a unique longitudinal data set of crime rates for small areas within particular cities. These data will allow me to assess the reliability of respondents to the questions about perceived crime. This will provide valuable information for future researchers who wish to use the subjective responses to the AHS for inferring the objective crime rates in neighborhoods. In addition, by linking in the official data I have collected with the AHS, I will be able to determine the sources of neighborhood satisfaction. This will provide insight if there are important neighborhood dimensions of neighborhood satisfaction that the AHS is not currently asking respondents, and provide guidance for future modification of the survey instrument.",1,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Kenneth A Bollen,John R Hipp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,Completed,The Going Public Decision and the Product Market,Boston,2006,2013.0,Shan N He,"While an initial public offering is probably the most heralded mechanism of going public, the most common and successful mechanism of going public is, however, through an acquisition of the private firm by an existing public company. Since going public allows the firm to access external financing through the equity market for the first time in its life, going public may have important implications for the firm’s product market performance as well. In this research project, we will analyze (for the first time in the literature) how the product market performance of a firm affects the timing of its going public decision. This analysis will inform the U.S. Census Bureau regarding the behavior of organizational change activity and its determinants, where the timing of changes in ownership informs business register processing activity.  We also analyze the consequences of a firm going public on various aspects of its subsequent product market performance. We propose to identify the sources of this poor performance by studying how a firm’s productivity, sales, market share, labor costs and employment levels, material costs, rental and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures change subsequent to going public. This analysis will provide important information on the way in which firms report the value of these measures as collected by Census Bureau programs.",17,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Enterprise Summary Report - ES9100 (large company),ESR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
463,Completed,"Migration in the Arctic: Subsistence, Jobs, and Well-being in Urban and Rural Communities",UCLA,2005,2010.0,E. Lance Howe,"The purpose of the proposed research is to increase the utility of U.S. Census Bureau data especially as it relates to understanding mobility of Arctic indigenous peoples, with a particular focus on Inupiat and other Inuit people. Our research proposes using decennial census long form data (1990, 2000) at the UCLA Census Bureau Research Data Center. In addition, as a part of our analysis, we will use data from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (2003), the North Slope Borough Census (1988–2003), the Government of Nunavut (1999, 2001, 2004), and Statistics Canada Aboriginal Peoples Survey (1991, 2001) along with the public U.S. Decennial Census PUMS and Census Summary Files 1–4 (1980–2000). 
In the Proposed Benefits section we outline how our research will provide the following direct benefits to the Census Bureau: 
(1) understanding and improving the quality of data produced through a Title 13 census; (2) enhancing the data collected in a Title 13 census; (3) identifying shortcomings of current data, collection programs, and/or documenting new data collection needs; (4) preparing estimates of population and characteristics of population as authorized under Title 13. Briefly, our research proposes the following: 
First, we compare household migration and social characteristic variables from other surveys with Census Bureau data. Active temporary migration, in combination with high rates of nonresponse, have contributed to suspect Census Bureau place-level data for certain variables in rural Alaska. Because of the uniqueness of questions in other survey instruments (such as temporary migration), we can test for differences in data quality, identify possible under-counts or overcounts, and suggest methods for improved remote rural enumeration. Second, we will improve the quality of data by estimating the effect of age, sex, and race imputation among large rural Alaska households (age and sex information for large Alaska households was lost due to a data capture error). Third, we use fitted values from private instruments to estimate the effect of nonresponse imputation in Census Bureau data. Fourth, we link private data sources with Census Bureau data to create a dataset, stored with the CRDC, which includes all Inupiat households living in the United States and additional Arctic place-level characteristics. Finally, we provide estimates of migration patterns within and between the Arctic regions of Alaska and the Canadian North. 
The proposed research on migration specifically addresses migration of Arctic indigenous people between rural communities, larger regional centers, and urban areas. We have three primary research objectives: (1) improve the utility of census data in order to more precisely document the economic and social characteristics of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) to refine and improve methods for analyzing migration decisions of individuals participating in mixed subsistence and cash economies in Arctic regions; 
(3) apply these improved methods to understand the particular migration behavior of the indigenous population in Arctic Alaska and Canada. 
We propose to address a number of questions about the causes and consequences of migration raised in previous studies. First, what are the roles of subsistence opportunities and community quality of life amenities in migration decisions? Second, how persistent and widespread are differences in migration patterns (such as gender differences)? Third, what can be said about the role of national policies regarding transfer income, education, and investment in community infrastructure on migration? Finally, what are the long-term consequences of migration decisions: is mobility on balance improving living conditions in Arctic communities, especially the poorest places, or is it draining leadership to larger settlements and exacerbating inequalities? Our approach views migration into and out of Arctic communities as a potential indicator of relative well-being for residents and takes into account subsistence opportunities and quality of life factors, as well as income earning opportunities. Our three levels of analysis include: i.) documenting patterns and stylized facts, ii.) testing community and regional differences, and iii.) applying a household production model to estimate well being by place. The model directly integrates subsistence opportunities into the migration decision and the estimated equations predict how changes in communities affect well-being directly and indirectly through their effects on migration. Comparing the Inupiat regions in Alaska to the Nunavut Territory of Canada in all three levels of analysis, we develop a demographic profile of migrants and migration rates over time and test hypotheses on the effect of changes in well-being on household migration decisions.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,Completed,IT and Organizational Capital,Boston,2005,2007.0,Adam R Saunders," 
In order to realize the potential benefits of computerization, investments in additional assets, such as organizational processes and worker knowledge, may be needed. We propose to investigate this hypothesis by combining our own data with that of the U.S. Census Bureau towards finding new ways of measuring organizational capital and how firms can best take advantage of technology. In particular, by assisting the Census Bureau in measuring these changes to the supply chain, we aim to increase the Census Bureau’s knowledge base in understanding the broader implications of technology in the workplace. Our research may shed light on the nature of the recent productivity revival and clarify the factors that are most important to its future sustainability. 
Our aim is that our research will enable the Census Bureau to assess the benefits of collecting data to better measure these technology-enabled complementary investments, in particular, within the context of the eStats program. At the moment, the majority of the eStats program is dedicated to measuring e-commerce revenue, such as B2C or B2B revenues. While e-commerce is an important feature of the new economy, we believe that our work will show that selling products online is only one of many ways that firms can leverage the power of information technology (IT) to create value. To look at only e-commerce revenues would be missing the broader change in the economy that is taking place: IT has compelled firms to reorganize themselves in new ways by reinventing and changing their business processes. We believe it would be worthwhile to more directly measure the underlying data behind this phenomenon. 
We also will help the Census Bureau explore ways to provide better statistics on the implications of changing technologies to the supply chain. In the past decade, firms have used IT to change the allocation information, decision rights, incentives, and ownership across firm boundaries. As the CIO of Nokia, Mikko Kosonen, recently noted at the 2004 MIT CIO Summit, new technologies have led to the emergence of an “extended enterprise.” These kinds of changes in the supply chain suggest a broader data gathering agenda about nature and scope of the benefits of computers and communications. Furthermore, they raise fundamental questions about the basic unit of measurement. Should it be the plant, the firm, or, perhaps, the whole value chain? We believe that our approach can help address these questions and lay the foundation for improved statistics and methodologies in coming years. 
Using a small sample of Fortune 1000 firms, our previous work has shown that the combination of organizational capital and computer investment together drive higher market values and higher productivity. In our project at the Census Bureau, we plan to extend this analysis along the following dimensions: 1) understand the effects of organizational capital after 1997; 2) aggregate Census Bureau measures of plant-level investment data to create a database of computer investment by firm and use estimating techniques to create IT stock by firm; and 3) use Census Bureau measures of Internet use as a proxy for organizational capital. These techniques will enable us to widen our earlier analysis to include thousands of firms of all sizes, across all sectors of the economy.",15,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,National Employer Survey,NES,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Adam R Saunders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

External data provide new information on the characteristics and patterns of migration that the Census Bureau’s migration data are not able to capture at present. The research design involves an analysis of qualitative data on the implications for producing intercensal demographic estimates of the population. The data consist of approximately 300 unstructured interviews with adult immigrants (aged 18 or over) who were born in any of 12 sending countries and who have lived in the United States for at least 3 months. The sending countries represent top source countries of recent migration (1995–2000) and/or very diverse types of migration ﬂows and experiences. The primary purpose of the project was to collect detailed data on what migrant ﬂows look like and to examine the demographic and other characteristics and experiences associated with diﬀerent types of ﬂows. Data include the socioeconomic background of migrants and their education, migration, work, and health histories. These data will be used to address the importance of social networks for international migration, occupational attainment, and residence (including internal migration and changes in household composition). These analyses will identify the limitations of and gaps in existing data that are currently used for intercensal demo-graphic estimates by providing the first systematic evaluation of migration questions since they were introduced. Second, they will provide a basis for proposing revisions to survey content, which can improve those estimates, and, in general, improve the quality of census survey data on the foreign born.

493,Completed,Venture Capital Financing in Young Firms,Triangle,2005,2009.0,Rebecca E Zarutskie," 
The primary purpose of this study is to enable the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand the role of venture capital (VC) financing in young firms and to improve the data collected in the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) and the Survey of Business Owners (SBO) by linking these datasets to an external dataset on VC financing. The researchers will suggest ways to improve the collection of information on VC financing and note any inconsistencies in variables across the Census Bureau datasets and the external data. The researchers will be the first to link the external dataset on VC financing (called VentureXpert) with the QFR and the SBO. The researchers will therefore create a bridge file that can be accessed by future users of these data. Finally, the researchers intend to empirically investigate important economic questions relating to VC. 
Using the SSEL Name and Address files from 1975 to 1999, the researchers will link VentureXpert to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) using a STATA coded name matching algorithm. The researchers will link the QFR (1982, 1987, 1992, 1997), and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners Survey (Firms and Owners) to the merged LBD-VentureXpert dataset using EINs and CFNs. The researchers will also link to the merged LBD-VentureXpert dataset the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Census of Manufactures, Census of Services, Census of Retail Trade, Census of Wholesale Trade, and Census of Construction Industries, and the 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Census of Transportation using EINs and CFNs. 
Using these data and additional data from SDC Platinum, Compustat®, CRSP, the FDIC Summary of Deposits and Call Reports, and BEA economic data, the researchers will estimate what are the determinants of receiving VC financing and what is the relationship between VC financing and a variety of firm outcomes, such as growth rates, survival rates, time to merger, and time to initial public offering. Additional analysis will be performed on the sub-sample of the LBD and VentureXpert, which can be matched to and the Annual Surveys of Manufactures (1975 to 2001).

503,Completed,Using Plant-Level Data to Assess the Motives for Aggregating Line of Business Information,Chicago,2005,2008.0,Daniel A Bens,"Our proposed study evaluates the degree of information aggregation selected by management in a firm’s published financial statements. This project will study the way financial data within a firm are grouped in the Compustat Database to the way they are grouped in the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and the Enterprise Summary Report (ES9100). Compustat is a database of information from firms’ published financial statements, whereas the LRD and the LBD contain establishment-level data reported to the U.S. Census Bureau by firms and collected from administrative records. The ES9100 provides aggregated firm information as reported by the firm to the Census Bureau. Firms have considerable discretion in how they aggregate business information when preparing their published financial statements. Thus, comparing these data to the more detailed establishment-level data will shed light on how discretion affects the aggregation of information by firms in general. Further, the project will assess the impact of this aggregation on industry classification. While many factors likely affect management’s aggregation decision, economic theory suggests two phenomena are particularly pertinent: proprietary costs and agency costs. Proprietary costs result from revealing proprietary information to competitors, suppliers, employees, customers, or other groups; our focus in this study will be on competitive proprietary costs. Shareholders incur agency costs when they delegate decision-making authority to agents (managers) whose interests are not fully aligned with those of the shareholders. Thus, investigating the impact of proprietary costs and agency costs on the aggregation of information in published financial statements is a central issue in our research proposal.

514,Completed,Plant Size and Plant Function,Washington,2006,2010.0,John J Stevens,"This project expands the notion of within-industry heterogeneity in plant size beyond variation in productivity to include variation in function. The main idea is that small plants tend to do different things than large plants; in particular, they specialize in custom work or retail-like activity that is often efficiently undertaken in small plants. This project studies the relationship between plant size and plant function by 1) constructing measures of dispersion across product lines within an industry across size classes; 2) looking for evidence that small plants engage in more custom and retail-like activity; 3) looking at variation in market areas within narrowly defined industries; and 4) determining the extent to which changes in the distribution of manufacturing establishments at a location parallel changes in the retail sector. The proposed project will bene-fit the U.S. Census Bureau through the tabulation of new statistics on the population of manufacturing establishments. These statistics will contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the industrial classifications used by the Census Bureau. The proposed analysis of industry definitions is of particular interest at this time because of the major shift from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) between the 1992 and 1997 Economic Censuses; this analysis will provide quantitative results on how the switch from SIC to NAICS affected the relationship between plant function and plant size within narrowly defined industries. In the longer run, the limitations of the industrial classification systems that we identify may aid in the design of future classification systems. The statistics tabulated in this project will also improve our understanding of the quality of the export data collected in the Census of Manufactures and Commodity Flow Survey (CFS); in particular, we will use the information in the CFS data to learn whether the well-known understatement of exports in the Census of Manufactures reflects a failure to correctly report export status or a failure to correctly report the value of exports.",7,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Adam X Greeney,James Lin,Joshua S Louria,Steven Schmeiser,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
524,Completed,Effects of CPS Topcoding on Labor Earnings and Income Inequality Estimates,Cornell,2006,2012.0,Shuaizhang Feng,"In the United States, the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement is the primary dataset used to measure these earnings inequality.  However, over time U.S. Census Bureau survey and data storage decisions have changed the maximum value of income items reported from survey respondents. These limits were disproportionately restrictive in earlier years. Feng and Burkhauser (2005) argue that their loosening in later years is likely to have disproportionately impacted inequality levels and trends over time.  Despite these problems, we argue that even using only the public-use data, researchers can make sensible inferences with respect to levels and trends in inequality.  This project will apply both the non-parametric  and parametric approaches to the restricted-access CPS income data from 1975 to the present.  By doing so, we will better measure the income and earnings distributions. In particular, we want to see how the upper portions of these distributions affect the levels and trends of inequality measures such as the Gini coefficients. We will also evaluate the extent to which public-use data can be used to capture inequality levels and trends, using the approaches we pro-posed.  Most importantly, the study will allow us to detect the differences in measuring inequality using the public-use data and restricted-access data. This will increase the value of public-use data to the research community, while still preserving the confidentiality of the restricted access data.",1,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Philip O Armour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
529,Completed,A Firm and Plant-Level Analysis of Outsourcing: Sources of Productivity Growth and Heterogeneity,Washington,2007,2013.0,Christopher J Kurz,"The proposed analysis takes two avenues by studying: (1) The industry and geographic heterogeneity in the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Research Database, and (2) the sources of productivity growth for outsourcing organizations. For researching industry and geographic variation, economic concentration indexes and Locational Gini coefficients will be estimated for different geographic and industry measures. Economic concentration indexes and Locational Ginis provide a statistical measure of the geographic and industrial agglomeration of outsourcing. In addition, plant and firm intermediate input demand is estimated as a function of domestic variables in order to determine the importance of the different factors that drive an organization’s decision to outsource. In particular, estimated demand functions calculate the importance of domestic wages, trade costs, regulation, and technology in the context of the decision to outsource. The derived demand estimation is verified through a probit analysis of the determinants of an organization’s decision to outsource. The second avenue of research, the productivity analysis, entails estimating differences in exit rates and decomposing productivity growth between outsourcing and non-outsourcing organizations. Estimates will be provided from various specifications that capture the factors important in the agglomeration and productivity growth of outsourcing within the United States.",8,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Exporter Database,EDB,Enterprise Summary Report - ES9100 (large company),ESR,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will examine the effect of ethnic concentrations on both earnings and employment in several high-immigration states (California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas) using the 1-in-6 sample of the 1990 and 2000 U.S. census. The large number of observations in these samples allows us to focus on broad ethnic categories (e.g., South American and Mexican, East Asian and Pacific Islander, Southwest Asian and African, and European and Russian) as well as specific ethnicities (e.g., Mexican, Chinese, Indian, etc.) that cannot be analyzed with more readily available public-use data.  In order to analyze the enclave effect, we will estimate a series of individual-level wage (and employment) equations that control for years since migration, cohort-specific effects, and other observable human capital and demographic characteristics. Wage and employment equations will be estimated for each ethnic group and a measure that captures the proportion of the individual’s census tract that is populated by a particular ethnic group will be introduced into the model. The results of this study will provide an understanding of the relationship between race and ethnic information collected by the decennial census and will identify possible problems in cur-rent data collection strategies. In addition, the wage equations will provide valuable population parameter estimates of returns to observable human capital and social capital in immigrant communities.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Roberto L Pedace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research will convey beneﬁts to the Census Bureau along three dimensions by producing estimates of R&D using establishment-based industry codes; by conducting data quality assessments of the SIRD data, which exploit the longitudinal nature of the data; and by analyzing ﬁrm-establishment relationships. The Census Bureau is currently in the process of a major redesign of the SIRD, so the insights gained from this project will be particularly timely in contributing to the improvement of the future versions of the SIRD. The project will make an important contribution to the Census Bureau’s eﬀorts to classify economic information on an establishment basis by identifying the establishments within each ﬁrm that are most likely to perform the ﬁrm’s R&D.

535,Completed,Job Availability and Employment,Michigan,2007,2012.0,Patrick M Kline,"Kain’s classic paper on spatial mismatch argued that residential segregation reduces the equilibrium employment of minorities by increasing the distance to available jobs. While a substantial literature has emerged testing this hypothesis, and the more general notion that one’s distance to potential jobs might reduce employment probabilities, few studies have been able to deal adequately with the endogeneity of firm and worker location decisions. This project uses a natural experiment to infer the wage and employment effects of moving employers closer to an underemployed population. Using the federal Empowerment Zone program as an exogenous predictor of firm location, the project develops an instrumental variables approach to estimating the elasticity of labor supply with respect to job availability. The analysis will utilize data from the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses, the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SSEL), and the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD).",3,Decennial Census,CEN,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Matias Busso,Jesse M Gregory,Patrick M Kline,Nazli M Toraganli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first component continues research begun under our previous project at the Berkeley Research Data Center. At the heart of that project was the development of a general equilibrium model of an urban housing market, using an extensive dataset built around restricted-access decennial census data for 1990. In developing this framework further, we will focus on two areas—the identification of key parameters of the model using a boundary fixed effects approach and carrying out informative counterfactual simulations using the equilibrium model in conjunction with our parameter estimates.  The second component uses two waves of decennial census data, for 1990 and 2000, to study the effects of California’s Class Size Reduction Act on local housing markets. Our goal is to measure the size of the induced effects of the reform on household sorting across schools and neighborhoods before estimating the effects of such changes on school and student performance. The third component will make use of the rich cross-sectional data for 2000 to develop and estimate a matching model that describes how workers are matched to firms in equilibrium. And the fourth component will take advantage of the two waves of decennial census data for California (used in the second component of our proposed research) to estimate a dynamic housing market model.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,Patrick J Bayer,Gregorio S Caetano,Aurel Hizmaj,Erika V Martinez,Robert McMillan,Alvin D Murphy,Vladislav Slanchev,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
539,Completed,The Labor Market for Older Workers,Triangle,2006,2010.0,David M Blau,"This project will generate new information on rigidities in the labor market for older workers by using rich longitudinal survey data on individuals matched to employment data on the firms that employ them. The individual data are from the Survey of Program Participation and the employer data are from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics files. The aims of this project are to address the following issues: (1) What accounts for differences in the age structure of employment across firms? Why do some firms employ a larger proportion of older workers than others, and why do some firms hire a larger share of older workers than others? Do differences in the age structure of employment across firms indicate the existence of labor market rigidities? (2) How does the age composition of employment and hiring in a firm affect hours worked and the rate of exit from the firm of older workers relative to younger workers, both to other firms and to nonemployment, controlling for the effects of worker characteristics? (3) What are the main factors responsible for rigidity in the labor market and its differential effects on older relative to younger workers? The main alter-native explanations that can be analyzed with matched worker-firm data are technology-based—fixed costs of hiring, training, and employment; team production considerations; costly monitoring of worker effort; and firm-specific human capital. These explanations can be studied with matched worker-firm data because technology is firm specific, even within industries. The project will address these questions by estimating regressions models explaining labor market transitions of workers as a function of the age distribution of employment in their firms, con-trolling for worker characteristics. The project will also estimate structural equilibrium models of the labor market intended to explain variation in the age structure of employment across firms.",1,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,David M Blau,Tetyana Shvydko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
544,Completed,Understanding the Impact of Trade on the U.S. Economy,Boston,2005,2010.0,J Bradford Jensen,"Measuring foreign trade in the United States, who trades, how it is conducted, where it originates, where it goes, and its impact on the U.S. economy is an important mission of the U.S. Census Bureau. A principal objective of the project is to build on prior work by linking additional years of import and export transaction data to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and enhancing the existing match of 1993 and 2000 data. The additional years to link are 1992, and 1994–1999 (with the hope of obtaining (and linking) additional years of data from the Foreign Trade Division). The links are made via the EIN information on the import and export transaction files to the Standard Statistical Establishment List files (SSEL) and for exports to Canada, the link is made via business name. We propose to investigate improved matching methodologies using enhanced statistical matching algorithms. 
With the additional linked data, the project proposes to examine a number of issues to increase the Census Bureau’s understanding of the quality of data collected in Title 13, Chapter 5 programs. The topical areas to be investigated include multinational corporation import and export pricing and valuation behavior, geographic and product market entry, the impact of trade on the domestic economy, and treatment of inventory in transit. The project requests the use of all economic census and survey data for the years 1963 through the most recent available (and future years as they become available), the SSEL files (including name and address information) for 1975-most recent available (and future years as they become available), the LBD for 1975-most recent available (and future years as they become available), the Foreign Trade Division import and export transaction data for 1992–2000 (and future years should they become available).

This project examines and evaluates the adoption and use of e-commerce across a diverse set of manufacturing firms.  It examines the Computer Network Use Supplement data on e-commerce gathered in the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) and analyzes the characteristics of firms that are related to the use of e-commerce. The focus is on manufacturing because it is currently the sector in which e-commerce is most widely adopted.  The project examines the implementation of e-commerce across manufacturing industries and product types and focuses on how it con-tributes to firms’ competitive advantage through changes in value chains. The analysis is set in the context of how the material characteristics of firms (ranging from size to ability to adopt innovation) impact their medium to long-term viability. While this analysis masks the complex ways in which e-commerce is put to work by firms, this focus on the firm and firm-level characteristics is a first step in uncovering the larger changes at the firm and regional level engendered by e-commerce. This project will also inform the Census Bureau about the quality of the e-commerce data collected using the ASM, about new methods for collecting this type of data, and about the characteristics of firms that influence the probability that and the degree to which a firm will use e-commerce. The Census Bureau would then be able to use this information to further assess the quality of data reported as well as be able to update cur-rent methods for imputing missing data.",4,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Thomas R Leinbach,Candice Y Wallace,Matthew A Zook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

556,Completed,From the Baby Boom: The Contraceptive Origins of Women,Michigan,2006,2009.0,Martha J Bailey,"Since the release of the first birth control pill in 1960, women’s fertility and work decisions have undergone a dramatic transition. By the turn of the century, the high fertility rates and low participation of the Baby Boom had evolved into high employment and high childlessness. While recent work links oral contraception to changes in fertility and marital timing and changes in the labor-force participation rates of younger women, these studies do not explore the importance of oral contraception in reshaping the career and mobility decisions of young women. Moreover, research on the changing gender gap does not consider the significance of greater fertility control on inter-mediate mobility decisions and, by extension, longer term wage and employment outcomes. The relationship of each of these outcomes with fertility control are interesting per se, but they may also provide insight as to how women were successful in “swimming upstream” in times of rising wage inequality and why changes in the gender gap appear to have stagnated since 1990.  The proposed project will explore dimensions of career mobility that have been important to women’s economic advancement since 1968—the importance of interstate mobility in determining educational, occupational, and employment paths and labor-force outcomes; how the importance of mobility has changed over time; and how changes in women’s career mobility might be related to oral contraception.  The project uses the restricted access geographic identifiers both in the March Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature Women.  These data facilitate both a comparative and descriptive analysis as well as an experimental evaluation of the origins and nature of the second demographic transition and the quality and shortcomings of the Current Population Survey in light of these population changes.",2,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,BLS - National Longitudinal Survey (Original Cohorts Geocode),NLS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Martha J Bailey,Brad J Hershbein,Amalia R Miller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
559,Completed,The Impact of Spin-out Generation on Parent and Progeny Firms,Chicago,2008,2013.0,Benjamin A Campbell,"Spin-outs are distinct entrepreneurial ventures where founding team members are ex-employees of an incumbent ﬁrm. In many industries, spin-outs (progeny ﬁrms) compete directly with the incumbents (parent ﬁrms) and are an important source of innovation and growth. Previous research has emphasized the beneﬁcial performance implications of the knowledge diﬀusion from the parent to the progeny and have found that the inherited knowledge provides spin-out ﬁrms both superior capabilities and performance vis-à-vis other entrants. However, little is known about the competitive eﬀects of these knowledge ﬂows on the subsequent capabilities and performance of parent ﬁrms. This project will investigate the processes that generate ﬁrm births and deaths in general but also those that generate spin-oﬀ  births in particular. The research will identify new ﬁrms, spin-oﬀ  ﬁrms, and the parents of these new spin-oﬀ ﬁrms in the legal services industry. It will analyze the characteristics of these new ﬁrms as well as the parents of spin-oﬀ  ﬁrms. This process is especially interesting in the services sector where barriers to entry are generally low and ﬁrm birth and death rates are very high. As a result of this high turnover, it has traditionally been diﬃcult to accurately mea-sure new ﬁrm generation, the characteristics of new ﬁrms, and the performance of new ﬁrms in the services sector. However, with a custom Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) extract in conjunction with the external Martindale-Hubbell directory, this project will be able to accurately portray characteristics of new and dying ﬁrms as well as to estimate birth and death rates in this sector. Moreover, this project will develop and test new methodologies of spin-oﬀ generation and knowledge as well as examine the quality of the LEHD data in comparison to the Martindale-Hubbell data.",1,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2004,LEHD-ECF-2004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

561,Completed,Teacher Quality and Wage Compression,Berkeley,2007,2012.0,Annalisa Mastri,"There is great concern among educators, policymakers, and laypersons about the perceived decline in primary and secondary school teacher quality over the past 40 years. Though this issue has spawned substantial academic and policy research on the relationship between student outcomes and observable measures of teacher quality (such as educational attainment, experience, and SAT scores), the results of such studies remain far from convincing. This project investigates the hypotheses that: 1) pay is more compressed in teaching than in other, comparable occupations; 2) as a result, high quality teachers leave teaching at higher rates than low quality teachers; and 3) this has a measurable effect on student outcomes. The Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, with its matched employer-employee wage data, is uniquely suited to this empirical investigation. The project will identify high quality teachers by their relative wages and the wage dispersion at their jobs after leaving a particular school district; this avoids many of the frequent criticisms found in the teacher quality literature. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) provides information on compensation and unionization policies in public schools in the states listed above; linked to the LEHD data this can establish the relationship between specific policies and wage compression. The Common Core of Data (CCD) provides basic information and descriptive statistics on all schools, their students, and their teachers; this information, linked to the LEHD, will provide many controls in the analysis and allow an investigation of student outcomes.",2,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2004,LEHD-ECF-2004,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,Completed,Identifying Firm Effects on Internal Wage Distributions,Baruch,2009,2011.0,Jesse M Rothstein,"This project uses Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data to investigate the hypothesis that firms compress wages. It will use merged data to construct measures of mass layoffs, individual displacement, and voluntary mobility among firms. The proposed testable hypotheses relate to the role of workers’ ranks within their firms’ wage distributions in predicting mobility decisions and wage changes, which requires use of the dense data about each firm’s wage structure to construct measures of within-firm worker ranks. The measurement of job transitions will provide several important benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) currently provide information on worker flows by worker characteristics and within fairly general (2-digit) industries, but the underlying data can support more disaggregated presentations. The project develops statistics that distinguish mass layoffs from other sources of worker flows and on the relation of the various types of flows to worker and plant characteristics. It explores the sensitivity of these measures to alternative methods for measuring displacement, and discusses options for incorporating statistics on mass layoffs into the QWI data. The first step in development of prototype QWI extensions will be the creation of consistent time series of employment at each firm, taking account of spurious changes arising from data shortcomings. This will be used to identify firm events such as establishment closings and mass layoffs under several definitions. The research will also extend existing measures of worker separations and accessions and the new displacement statistics to describe their distributions across firm size and worker seniority categories—each important components of any assessment of the economic impact of these events.",5,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2008,LEHD-ECF-2008,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2008,LEHD-EHF-2008,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2008,LEHD-ICF-2008,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2008,LEHD-U2W-2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

566,Completed,Antecedents and Consequences of Outsourcing Innovation Activities,Michigan,2007,2010.0,Michael A Stanko,"This project explores the firm level drivers of innovation outsourcing, such as exploratory research performed, inventory turnover, and consequences such as innovation costs and other financial outcomes. Industry level moderators of these relationships are also proposed.  This research project investigates the extent to which increased outsourcing of research and development (R&D) recategorizes innovation activities, which, if carried out internally, would be classified as manufacturing but when contracted to a specialist firm is categorized as a service.  Time series analysis of shifts from manufacturing to nonmanufacturing will illustrate the extent to which the growth of contract R&D creates (or does not create) a measurement problem and give insight into the comparability of historical data with more recent years’ data.  The project will compute Herfindahl indexes for nonmanufacturing industries. The Census Bureau currently publishes Herfindahl indexes for the manufacturing sector but not for nonmanufacturing. This project will provide estimates of how firm and industry characteristics differentially influence the propensity to outsource innovation activities, as well as the consequences of this outsourcing.

570,Completed,Real Investments and Managerial Career Concerns,Michigan,2007,2011.0,An Chee (Angie) . Low,"This project examines how managerial career concerns, proxied by age, affect firm real investment policies. These career concerns can lead to distortions in the decisions to build or destroy plants since such decisions reflect on the ability of the manager to make good decisions. The researchers estimate logistic regressions to test whether managerial career concerns affect the probability of plant births, deaths, sales, and purchases. The research will also test the “trapped administrator” phenomenon where a manager who is afraid of losing her reputation is more reluctant to cease investments in unproductive plants which she built or acquired and may even try to increase the resources to these plants in order to prevent failure.  This project will prepare new tabulations of public firms managed by different demographic groups. To understand whether CEO age affects plant births and deaths, the investigators will tabulate the different investment projects against CEO age and also prepare tabulations relating the value of capital expenditures, value of shipments, and total employment to CEO age. The project will provide benefits through the production of population level estimates of plant births and deaths and by relating variation in these plant activities to managerial characteristics. Logistic models are used to relate CEO age and gender to the probability of various investment (or disinvestment) projects being undertaken. Additional estimates will show how managerial characteristics influence plant-level capital expenditures. These estimates of the impact of managerial age and other demographic variables are important as they shed light on how changing demographics can affect macroeconomic employment and productivity patterns.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Scott E Yonker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
573,Completed,Patterns of Firm Expansion,Chicago,2007,2013.0,Chad W Syverson,"This project explores issues of firm expansion. Those address the following: what factors determine the firms that will expand; the underlying reasons for expansion (e.g., efficiency vs. market power); the manner of expansion (intensive or extensive, acquisition or building new); the choice of whom to acquire, if that is the preferred expansion mode; and the impact on other players in the market, be they competitors or consumers. Focus is on expansion along the extensive margin, that is, through the purchase of existing establishments or the building of new ones. For data reasons, the project concentrates on manufacturing establishments, but some analyses will also be done for non-manufacturing sectors. The Longitudinal Business Database will be tied to production information from the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Sur-vey of Manufactures, and the Commodity Flow Survey. In its examination of firm expansion patterns, the project focuses on examining changes in linkages between establishments and firms during changes in owner-ship and on changes in establishment employment, payroll, and revenues as establishments and firms expand. Additionally, this project will inform the Census Bureau about supply chains within industries and how e-business impacts supply chain relationships.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Ownership Change Database,OCD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project results will provide information that can be used to improve measurement of business survival in the new Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO).  This project proposes to use the most current (1992) version of the CBO to revisit earlier findings regarding firm survival patterns.  It will investigate the robustness of the CBO database for portraying small-business survival patterns for employer businesses, using the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to track CBO firm survival patterns.  This research also is relevant to the new SBO. Information from this will increase the U.S. Census Bureau’s knowledge base regarding business survival dynamics. The SBO survey staff can use this knowledge to improve SBO response rates by tailoring their sample designs to businesses based on their likelihood of still being in business.  This could help reduce the number of out-of-scope cases that occur when a portion of the sample is selected from the previous year business register, but responses are only used when the business remains active for the next year. The results from this research can also assist the Census Bureau in the construction or improvement of the sampling frame for the SBO survey.",1,Characteristics of Business Owners-Firms and Owners Extract,CBOE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

580,Completed,Understanding Micro-Productivity Heterogeneity,Michigan,2006,2011.0,Jagadeesh M Sivadasan,"Making an initial public offering (IPO) of equity, otherwise known as “going public,” is an important event in the life of a firm. In this research project, we will analyze how the product market performance of a firm affects the timing of its going public decision.  While the existing literature has documented that firms have poor operating performance (as measured by profits) in the years immediately after going public, the precise reason for this poor performance has not been previously addressed. We propose to identify the sources of this poor performance by studying how a firm’s productivity, sales, market share, labor costs and employment levels, material costs, rental and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures change subsequent to going public. This analysis will provide important information on the way in which firms report the value of these measures as collected by U.S. Census Bureau programs.   In addition, public firms in general are under more scrutiny and monitoring by regulatory agencies than private firms because once a firm becomes public, it has to file its relevant information on a regular basis to the securities exchange and other regulatory authorities, and answer to its shareholders. Thus, the public financial disclosure requirement may strengthen the firm’s internal data collection and reporting, and this in turn may lead to a better response rate and better reporting quality to the surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. By identifying the public versus private status of establishments in the Census Bureau databases, we will also be able to analyze the data quality of these establishments prior to and after going public, and report if there are any changes in the quality of the data reported by various establishments after this change in public versus private status.",13,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,Matthew R Backus,Sreedhar T Bharath,Sasha - Brodsky,Reid M Dorsey-Palmateer,Xiaoyang Li,Nicholas E Powers,Stanley A Sedo,Marek Zapletal,Bo Zhao,Yue M Zhou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
582,Completed,Telephone Penetration of Low Income Households,Baruch,2007,2011.0,Michael H Riordan,"Telephone penetration—the percentage of households with telephone service—is the accepted measure of universal service in the United States. This research studies the telephone penetration of low-income households in the United States. One purpose of the study is to measure the determinants of telephone penetration of low-income households, including the effects of universal service policies that reduce the prices these households pay for telephone service. Another objective is to compare predictions generated by the econometric model with standard hotdeck imputations used to assign responses for households that do not respond to the telephone availability question. The study uses cross-section and panel econometric methods to estimate the demand for telephone service by low-income households. The explanatory variables are demographic and location characteristics, including the characteristics of the telephone service plans offered to low-income households. The econometric analysis estimates the price elasticity of demand for telephone service for different demographic groups. Predicted household demands are aggregated to explain the determinants of changes in telephone penetration of low-income households between 1990 and 2000. Predictions from the econometric model are compared to imputations from standard hotdeck methods used for dealing with nonresponses to the telephone availability question. The study estimates the price elasticity of demand for telephone service of different demographic groups and measures the determinants of changes in telephone penetration between 1990 and 2000, including the effects of universal service policies that reduced the prices low-income households pay for telephone service.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These series help shed light on the underlying sources of productivity differences. First, for 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and 5-digit North American Industry Classification System industries, and for state and metropolitan geographic areas, we will construct and document industry series on the quality of products made. This quality index will exploit the unit price data provided for many of the 7-digit SIC products in the Census of Manufactures to measure the extent to which differences in productivity across establishments show up as differences in product quality. Our second contribution will be to provide new geographic area and industry series on the extent to which factor inputs are misallocated across plants in a geographic area or in a given industry.

The project focuses on three dimensions of this process: 1) The estimation of the individual and context characteristics that underlie internal migration to nontraditional destinations; 2) The analysis of place and individual characteristics associated with both residential stability and residential churning for foreign-born persons residing in non-traditional destinations; and 3) The examination of the process of selection of destinations for those departing from nontraditional settlement areas. The analysis utilizes McFadden choice models to estimate the role of different destination contexts in attracting foreign born. Multilevel logit models estimate the processes of departure from gateway and nontraditional places. This project will enhance census and ACS data by generating knowledge on cohort residential trajectories between the 1980s and early 2000s. The research on destination choices will also provide a detailed picture of the migration links between specific types of places. In addition to describing the nature of these linkages, the research will shed light on the dynamics underlying emerging trends in the internal migration and settlement behaviors of the growing foreign-born population.",3,American Community Survey,ACS,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata,ACSUNEDIT,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research project seeks to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the effect of the current implemented imputation techniques in the annual Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD).  Since the early 1990s, there has not been a systematic evaluation of the current imputation procedures and their effects on survey estimates. The purpose of this project is to evaluate and recommend improvements to the current imputation methods in the SIRD. Specifically, we will use the 1999-2003 SIRD datasets at the Center for Economic Studies to evaluate the effects of current imputation methods on survey estimates in the SIRD. This project has three aims: (1) to describe the current imputation methods currently used in the SIRD; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the current imputation methods through precision and accuracy measures; and (3) to compare current imputation methods with alter-native imputation methods and formulate recommendations for improvement. The overall goal is to assess the effect of the imputation techniques on the quality of this survey data, including variance estimates. Simulations will be carried out using standard precision and accuracy measures (bias, variance, and mean square error) for evaluating the current imputation methods.

Central to each component is an innovative framework that will enable us to use cross-sectional data to address certain dynamic questions regarding education. This framework leverages the discontinuity in the year of school entry created by the school entry rules in most states. The 2000 decennial census long form sample is crucial for the implementation of this frame-work.  We will study some of the causal determinants and effects of schooling attainment, using the differences in schooling attainment as of a certain age that are created by the school entry laws.   Our proposed project will yield at least three benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau.  We will develop a modified proxy of the variable “labor market experience”.  We will develop a “modified potential experience” (MPE) variable that is a more accurate proxy for experience than the commonly used PE measure.  As part of the first phase of our project we will use the MPE variable to provide new evidence on the value of additional labor market experience. We intend to estimate the fraction of recent movers who would have responded to the Current Population Survey WHYMOVE question that they moved for reasons of the education of the children. The available responses to the WHYMOVE question exclude this possible answer, despite the fact that many families move to be closer to a desirable school. With the new imputed category, it will be possible to identify people who moved because of education for their children. As part of the second phase of the project we will use data from the census to summarize the characteristics of families who moved for education-related reasons (as opposed to other reasons) and develop reduced form and structural models of the process of residential mobility underlying Tiebout-style choice.",1,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
606,Completed,"Employment and TANF Outcomes for Low-Income Families Receiving Child Care Subsidies in Illinois, Maryland and Texas:  Phase I",Chicago,2006,2010.0,Allison G Harris,"The disparity between persons enrolled in U.S. federal poverty programs and persons who respond to U.S. Census Bureau surveys saying they are enrolled appears to be systemic across programs. This research will analyze the child care subsidy (CCS) take-up decision and a range of employment and welfare outcomes among all low-income families in Illinois, Maryland, and Texas. This project will improve the Census Bureau’s understanding of who uses the child care subsidy and how the subsidy aids different groups of low-income families in their quest for economic independence. The groups we distinguish are those who are currently receiving cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, those who have recently left TANF, and those who have had no recent contact with the TANF program (frequently referred to as the working poor).  This proposed research will further benefit the Census Bureau’s data programs by prototyping an eligibility microsimulation model for a specific federal poverty program (the Child Care and Development Fund in this case) that can be tailored for other programs. Since federal poverty programs are dependent on current surveys for program administration and program size estimates, the quality of the surveys is of great interest to the Census Bureau as well as to federal poverty programs.

Census data are linked to external data on advertising agencies, specifically the Advertising Red Book.  The project compares census data coverage with publicly available data on advertising agencies.  The project will produce estimates of the population of advertising establishments, which will inform the Census Bureau’s knowledge base on the extent of scale and scope economies in the supply of advertising and marketing service industries and the relation of such economies to the overall organizational structure of firms in this industry. It will examine entry, exit, and acquisitions at various levels of aggregation—individual establishment, the multi-establishment advertising agency, and the global holding companies.

610,Completed,Innovative Activity and Organizational Change: Private versus Public Status and Acquisitions,Washington,2007,2011.0,Gordon M Phillips,"This project studies innovation and research and development in the spirit of Schumpeter where innovation and research and development (R&D) are part of the process of creative destruction in the economy. Using data on both public and private firms, it examines how firm organization changes following innovation that is initiated by itself, or by firms in its own upstream and downstream industries. It also studies the impact of firm organization on the exploitation of R&D expenditures and patents. The central premise of this study is that organizations adjust to industry technological change as both additional research and the development of ideas after patents require extensive organizational and financial resources. It focuses on two types of organizational adaptations: the decision to be private or publicly listed and changes in firm boundaries through mergers and acquisitions. Firms differ in the extent of their operations across multiple industries. Some firms choose to be focused and produce in single industries. Other firms produce in multiple industries. The central question is the extent that these two dimensions are significant in explaining which firms conduct and then commercialize research and patent activity. This project will provide evidence on the importance of research and the development of that research in determining the boundaries of the firm by examining three different aspects of innovative activity. These include patent activity, patent citations, and R&D expenditures.",12,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It extends earlier work examining the causal role of a college education in subsequent geographic mobility to answer the important questions of why and how college going increases long distance mobility.  Educational differences in migration primarily occur between the college educated and everyone else.  The project studies gender differences in lifetime migration patterns, particularly the manner in which these have evolved across cohorts.  Migration patterns for women may have changed along with the dramatic increase in education and labor force participation that women experience over the latter half of the twentieth century.  The research involves two stages. The first employs longitudinal data to construct complete migration histories of a representative sample of U.S. residents. The second stage builds on the first, using information in the migration histories to test ideas about which mechanisms explain the different rates of long distance moves across education and gender groups.",1,BLS - National Longitudinal Survey (Original Cohorts Geocode),NLS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Abigail K Wozniak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It investigates the drivers of firm IT investment that are likely to be endogenous in standard models of how IT affects firm behavior. The primary outcome of this research and main benefit will be more accurate and more-nuanced estimates of firm populations that invest in IT, as well as insights into the characteristics and distributions of these different subpopulations in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Another central outcome will be an assessment of the quality and consistency of existing census data on the digital economy. Directly linking and comparing datasets, as well as improving the Census Bureau’s under-standing of the interaction between IT, the infrastructure needed to support e-business, and evolving supply chain relationships in the U.S. economy, will reveal observable patterns in nonresponse, highlight inconsistencies across surveys and years, verify the stability of important empirical relation-ships across time, and suggest ways to improve future surveys.",7,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work on the relationship between cluster composition and the economic performance of regions and their clusters has revealed data limitations, in particular the signiﬁcant level of data suppression of industry-level data in smaller, largely rural regions. Using the economic census and the Longitudinal Business Database, this project will investigate the ability of a cluster concept of collocated industries (those linked through their supply chain and other agglomeration forces) to pro-vide an opportunity to publish regional aggregations with less need for disclosure suppressions. The project will further investigate the deﬁnitions of clusters and their development over time. The research will generate estimates of the economic performance of a region and its clusters.

619,Completed,"Interfirm Job Mobility, Local Labor Markets, and Organizational Dynamics in Retail",Chicago,2008,2012.0,Troy C Blanchard,"American public opinion reﬂects a growing concern about employment stability and a weakening of the bond between employer and employee. Less stability means more frequent interﬁrm job changes that can result in interruptions in company beneﬁts (especially health insurance), decreases or stagnation in wages, and involuntary entry into contingent or temporary employment relations. This project examines interﬁrm mobility by introducing locality into an analysis of the retail industry. Job mobility is best gauged with measures of the dynamic characteristics of firms as they function in their local context. At the organizational level, workers in locally oriented retail business establishments exhibit different mobility pat-terns than their counterparts employed in non-locally oriented ﬁ rms. This research seeks to analyze the inﬂuence of local organizational and labor market dynamics on interﬁrm mobility of workers, examine the mobility of workers in locally oriented and non-locally oriented ﬁrms with special attention to times of economic expansion and recession, and explore the direction of interﬁrm mobility in terms of earnings stability, appreciation, or depreciation over time.",8,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2008,LEHD-ECF-2008,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2008,LEHD-EHF-2008,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2004,LEHD-GAL-2004,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2008,LEHD-ICF-2008,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2008,LEHD-U2W-2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The working hypothesis is that rising female opportunity discouraged marriage, but that eﬀect diminished over time; after 1970 the decline in the supply of young men with good jobs was the key factor behind late marriage. Previous eﬀ orts to address these questions were stymied by inadequate geographic precision in available public-use microdata and by insuﬃcient sample sizes, especially for racial minorities.

621,Completed,"Earnings, Productivity, and Hierarchies: Legal Services, 1977-2007",Chicago,2007,2010.0,Thomas Hubbard,"Wage inequality increased substantially in the United States during the past quarter century. The sources of this increase and its public policy implications have been controversial, both within academia and among policy makers. Much of the debate has surrounded whether this increase was due to technological factors, such as the diffusion of information technology, or to policy changes, such as reductions in the minimum wage (in real terms).  Economists have proposed that organizational structure affects wage inequality and can amplify the effect of technological factors, especially in contexts where production is human-capital intensive. Understanding what affects wage inequality in human-capital-intensive sectors is particularly important because these sectors occupy a high and growing share of U.S. economy and because many government policies aimed at raising wages at the low end do so by increasing these workers’ human capital. If wages are affected not just by individuals’ human capital, but the organizational structure in which individuals’ work, one can make these policies more productive by applying them in organizational contexts where they are likely to have the greatest impact on wages. This proposal examines the quality of the 2002 Census of Services data for legal services firms, compares their quality to that of previous census of Services, and produces estimates of number of lawyers that extend a series that the Census Bureau published for 20 years but failed to publish in 2002. The research also investigates how the organization of legal services—in particular, firms’ hierarchical structure—has changed over time, characterizes the distribution of wages in this industry and how it has changed over time, and analyzes relationships between changes in hierarchies and changes in the wage distribution. The latter will lead to a better understanding of wage inequality not only in legal services, but also in human-capital-intensive sectors (such as services) more broadly.",5,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Services,CSR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project will enhance the Census Bureau’s knowledge base regarding the specific area of investigation, which is the distribution of energy output ratios specifically and in relationship to the distribution of total factor productivity. This understanding could lead to improved editing and screening procedures, ultimately improving the overall Economic Census program.

Speciﬁcally, it will estimate the impact of loan access on the following outcomes: diﬃculty paying rent and utilities, eviction, termination of utilities due to default, delay of needed health care, and household debt. The measure of loan access, geographic proximity to payday loan stores, depends upon fairly detailed information on house-hold location (census tract and county), necessitating access to nonpublic geographic identiﬁers in the SIPP. By investigating a determinant of economic well-being among low-income individuals, this project fulﬁlls one of the Census Bureau’s goals in conducting the SIPP: to provide improved measures of economic well-being.

641,Completed,Employer Health Insurance Offer Decisions in An Era of High Deductible Plans,Washington,2009,2014.0,Amanda M Pomeroy,"A recent development in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is the introduction of consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs). These plans, which include health reimburse­ment arrangements (HRAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs), place more financial responsibil­ity for health care decisions in the hands of the consumer with the goal of controlling health care costs. This project studies ESI offers of insurance, including offers of CDHPs and other types of plans, the number of plans offered, cost sharing decisions, and how CDHPs affect the overall mix of plans offered. This study uses the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPS-IC), which provides details on health insurance plans offered by employers. Data are also collected on characteristics of the establishment and its workforce. To capture local market characteristics, the MEPS-IC data will be merged with external data sources including the Current Population Survey, Survey of Income and Program Participation, and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey- Household Component. This project will provide various benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau. The quality of the data will be better understood fol­lowing comparisons between estimates using the MEPS-IC and other sources of information on ESI, including the Kaiser/Health Research and Educational Trust Employer Health Benefits Survey and the Robert Wood Johnson Employer Health Insurance Survey. This study will also examine the quality of a longitudinal database created using the MEPS-IC, while also creating a supplemental longitudinal dataset using synthetic panel methodology. This project will create two new measures for the MEPS-IC: (1) a predicted premium for non-offering establishments, and (2) a quantity-adjusted premium for each health insurance plan type (e.g., health maintenance organization or any provider plan). Finally, this research will produce a number of new estimates using these newly created measures and merged data, including estimates of ESI offers using the predicted premium information, CDHP offers, number of plans offered, and cost sharing.",4,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project combines PACE data with other Census Bureau datasets and with external data to model the impact of pollution abatement spending on economic factors, such as the plant’s production costs and productivity, as well as its pollution emissions. The research will test accuracy of reported abatement expenditures by modeling their impact on total factor productivity levels, which should decrease productivity on a one-for-one basis if abatement activities contribute nothing to production. It also models the plant’s production function, testing whether the productivity of speciﬁc types of inputs are more seriously aﬀected by pollution abatement activities. Analyses include tests for differences across plants in abatement costs and in their impact on productivity, based on plant size, age, and other observed characteristics. The project will also model the impact of reported abatement costs on a variety of business decisions, including shifts in economic activity and investment, providing an indirect test for the reality of abatement costs. The project will beneﬁt the Census Bureau in several ways. The PACE survey has been recently resumed after an extended hiatus, so information about its data quality and comparisons to data from earlier versions of the survey are valuable. Our models of the impact of reported PACE spending on productivity and emissions test their validity in two ways: are they costs, and do they abate pollution? Our external datasets provide information on production technology and material use that will be used to assess the quality of comparable Census Bureau-collected information.

649,Completed,Imports and Productivity in U.S. Manufacturing,Baruch,2008,2012.0,Victor A Shlychkov,"The measurement of foreign trade ﬂows—imports and exports—is an important component of the information the Census Bureau collects on the overall U.S. economy. The research will bring data from these two programs together to provide more extensive characterization of foreign trade activity in U.S. manufacturing ﬁrms and variation in ﬁrm productivity. The project will prepare estimates of the relationship between productivity and how ﬁrms organize production with a particular focus on the role of trade and foreign sourcing in the supply chain. This project will also produce estimates of the relationship between exports, imports, and growth in productivity and ﬁrm size. The project will contain analyses that serve to assess the quality of data collected on the supply chain in the 2002 Economic Census. The project will address whether productivity level determines the organizational form of the ﬁrm and whether importing leads to productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing or if higher productivity leads to imports. By estimating models of productivity growth that take the impact of both import and export behavior into account, this research will provide new, enhanced estimates of the relationship between exports, imports, and productivity and how such relationships might vary with ﬁrm characteristics and industry. Estimates will also be produced of the relationship between ﬁrm growth (employment and revenues), imports, and exports. Accurate estimation of such relationships is an important tool to be used in the consideration of how trade liberalization will impact businesses and the economy.

655,Completed,"Trade, Globalization, and the Enterprise-Establishment Relationships of Multinational Companies",Washington,2008,2012.0,Maria Borga,"This project examines the impact of trade and globalization on U.S. businesses. The project has three objectives. It will study the regional impacts of rapidly growing U.S. foreign exports of services by developing estimates of exports of services at the state level. It will examine the impact of globalization by U.S. multinational companies through direct investment, trade, and the oﬀ -shoring of services on the U.S. economy. It will examine the relationship between an enterprise and its establishments and explore methods of allocating enterprise-level data to establishments in various industries. All three components of this project will involve supplementing data collected at the Census Bureau on U.S. business activities with data collected at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on the operations of multinational ﬁrms and on trade in services. Most Census Bureau business data are collected at the establishment level, while BEA’s surveys are conducted on a consolidated business enterprise basis. Linking these datasets greatly increases their analytic value by allowing questions about decisions made at the enterprise level—such as where to locate production to serve foreign customers—to be examined using the establishment-level data best suited to answering them. This project will build on previous projects that have linked Census data with BEA enterprise data. These previous linking projects have provided beneﬁts to the Census Bureau, and this project will expand on these beneﬁts. For example, it will enable the Census Bureau to improve its sample frames, verify and improve the accuracy of data reported on its surveys, and improve the industry classiﬁcations of enterprises and establishments.

The project uses the Survey of Business Owners (SBO), Business Register, Longitudinal Business Database, and Decennial Long Form data to address the following questions: (1) what are the characteristics of ethnic entrepreneurs and ethnic enterprises and how do they differ by group and by region, and (2) how are ethnic minority owned enterprises socially and spatially embedded in each urban context, and (3) what are the impacts of place on the presence and performance of ethnic enterprises. This project will benefit U.S. Census Bureau programs by an investigation of variation in survey nonresponse in the SBO across ethnic groups (sampling frames), across economic charac­teristics of firms, and across geographic areas. Thus this study will increase the Census Bureau’s understanding of the quality of the SBO data, help improve imputations for nonresponse, and potentially help improve the sampling frame for the SBO. The study will also aid the preparation of estimates and characteristics of the Hispanic and Asian sub-group populations and help minimize problems of missed and inaccurately represented subpopulations in the decennial census.

658,Completed,Older Workers' Displacement and Mobility,Cornell,2009,2013.0,Lars N Vilhuber,"This project will compute novel statistics useful in the analysis of older workers’ mobility and retirement decisions using individual data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with indices created from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure microdata. It will create refined employment opportunity indices based on detailed characteristics of the potential retirees. Currently available statistics, such as the LEHD’s Quarterly Workforce Indicators, provide detailed statistics by simple characteristics of the workforce, such as gender and age. This project will include additional characteristics in the computation of the employment opportunity indices. These include the respondents’ previous industry specific employment experience, the retirement decisions of similarly experienced individuals, and the mobility decisions of similar individuals. There would be three new types of indices: (1) a “job matrix,” which captures the geographic mobility patterns in employment; (2) a “mobility matrix,” which captures residential geographic mobility; and (3) an “opportunity index,” which is a person-specific convolution of these two matrices. The observed job mobility patterns of LEHD individuals, and in particular of older workers, will be used to estimate industry mobility patterns of recently hired workers at a detailed geographic level of work locations, the job matrix. The critical research issue is to determine the level of integration at which the new indices will be combined with existing data to produce a model estimation and forecasting framework. The observed geographic mobility of both LEHD and HRS individuals will be used to compute migration patterns of older workers and recent retirees to new residence locations, the mobility matrix. The mobility matrix (conditional on the HRS individual’s residence at any point in time) can be used to weight the job matrix (conditional on the HRS individual’s current or previous job characteristics), thus obtaining a person-specific job opportunity index, which is then incorporated into the relevant model. The utility of the proposed new indices, at the detailed and the aggregate level, will be assessed in a model-based framework. Using detailed demographic and geographic attributes of individuals, available on the HRS data with geographic supplement, models of the joint determina­tion of geographic mobility, and retirement will be estimated and tested for independence of these two decisions.",13,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2008,LEHD-ECF-2008,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2008,LEHD-EHF-2008,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2008,LEHD-ICF-2008,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Max Schiller-Risch,Till M Von wachter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
662,Completed,Firm Performance Effects of Broad-based Employee Stock Ownership,Michigan,2008,2013.0,Paige P Ouimet,"This project examines whether broad-based equity-based incentives are eﬀective at aligning incentives and the potential costs associated with providing these incentives. If employee ownership provides appropriate incentives, worker productivity should be higher and employee turnover should be lower. However, employee ownership also gives employees voting rights, which can be used to extract employee beneﬁts at the expense of other stakeholders in the ﬁrm. For example, workers with voting rights may be more successful at obtaining above-market wages or in delaying or preventing layoﬀ s or plant closures. Examining the eﬀects of employee ownership on ﬁrm and establishment performance measures—such as productivity and wages—which in turn aﬀect ﬁrm value, will provide important insights into the beneﬁts and limitations of equity-based compensation.",9,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Form 5500 Bridge File,F55BF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2004,LEHD-BRB-2004,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,Serdar Aldatmaz,Tania Babina,Earnest Curtis,Eung H Kim,Monica C McInerney Wood,Mai Anh Ngo,Paige P Ouimet,Rebecca E Zarutskie,Gang Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this project are to describe the return or resettlement in the year following Hurricane Katrina of people who resided in New Orleans before the storm and to examine the well-being of the pre-Katrina New Orleans population in the year after the hurricane, compared to a matched population from the prior year. The ACS data provide a unique opportunity to examine the geographic dispersion of New Orleans residents throughout the United States in the after-math of Hurricane Katrina and to assess several important dimensions of well-being. This project addresses a number of unanswered research questions about the eﬀects of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans’ population. It also explores the strengths and weaknesses of the ACS data for examining the eﬀects of Hurricane Katrina and for future studies of the effects of large-scale natural and man-made disasters. The researchers will evaluate the suitability of propensity-score reweighting techniques for studying these topics using the ACS by, for example, examining which population groups are underrepresented and overrepresented between the two ACS cross-sections.",1,American Community Survey,ACS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Denise J Duffy,William H Frey,Jesse M Gregory,Narayan Sastry,Chang-cherng Sun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
665,Completed,Minority Migrant Dispersal Over Five Decades,Michigan,2009,2014.0,William H Frey,"This research evaluates migration processes associated with race-ethnic redistribution—both across and within large U.S. metropolitan areas over the period 1970–2000—to detect tendencies toward greater minority dispersal. The last 3 decades have shown a dramatic rise in the size and diversity of the nation’s race and ethnic minority populations, but they have also shown these populations to be quite unevenly distributed across metropolitan areas as well as within them. The concentration of Hispanic and Asian populations in New York, Los Angeles, and a few other large metropolitan areas is related to their recent immigrant status and attachments to coethnic communities in those areas. Yet, recent Census 2000 results suggest their greater geographic dispersal. The African-American population, while less concen­trated than these groups, has shown an increased tendency to relocate in the South, revers­ing a long-standing movement in the reverse direction. Within metropolitan areas, all three groups are more concentrated in central cities and selected inner suburb communities, than non- Hispanic Whites. Yet, all three have shown tendencies toward greater suburbanization, which have been more apparent in growing metropolitan areas that are attracting more minorities. The migration processes underlying these inter-metropolitan, and intra-metropolitan minority redistribution patterns will be evaluated in this study using the 1970–2000 decennial censuses and the American Community Survey. The study will assess the extent to which these migration processes are leading to a greater dispersion of race and ethnic minorities both across and within large metropolitan areas.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Megan J Benetsky,William H Frey,Kao-lee Liaw,Julie Park,Chang-cherng Sun,Lori B Zehr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
668,Completed,Private equity deals: operational and financial performance of US buyouts,Triangle,2008,2012.0,Fernando R Chaddad,"The present study is based on prior work that studied the financial performance of a sample of leveraged buyouts (LBO) and going-private transactions occurring between 1978 and 1989. That project identiﬁed shortcomings of census data collection programs by comparing Census Bureau data to other overlapping data by conducting quality checks of Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) data against other sources such as Standard and Poor’s COMPUSTAT®. The present study will extend the methods developed for the 1993 Center for Economic Studies (CES) study over many more years of data to examine the recent phenomenon of private equity buyouts using the QFR data. The researchers will directly compare the LBO of the 1980s with present-era private equity deals. This will improve the Census Bureau’s understanding of ﬁrm structure and ownership change, as well as the impact of these on ﬁrm performance. This project will also increase the Census Bureau’s knowledge base regarding the ﬁnancial and operational performance of private equity buyouts in the United States from 1990 to 2007 and, hence, improve the Census Bureau’s understanding of ﬁrm structure and ownership change. The main question to be answered is how do present-era private equity buyouts per-form ﬁnancially and operation-ally. Moreover, this project will determine whether the short-term (1 year) and the longer-term performance (3 years) of private equity buyouts increases, decreases, or remains unchanged for the sample of buyout ﬁrms, relative to their industry peers. It will also determine whether the sources of improvements were purely ﬁnancial (debt) or operational in nature. This can lead to serious implications with regards to ﬁrm and national competitiveness. This study will also address the question of how similar today’s private buyouts are vis-à-vis the 1980s LBO. As the recent problems in subprime lending have shown, problems in one debt class can have large repercussions on the economy as a whole.",1,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Fernando R Chaddad,Steven W Ho,David J Ravenscraft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

674,Completed,The Dynamics of Owner Age and Business Performance,Michigan,2009,2013.0,William D Bradford,"This study uses the Characteristics of Business Ownership (CBO), the Survey of Business Ownership (SBO), the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), and the Business Register (BR) to examine the relationship between age and entrepreneurship. This research derives from a common question among scholars and practitioners: What owner traits predict business performance (e.g., employment, sales, profits, survival)? This study contributes to this research by using census data to test the strength of owner age in predicting business performance and by measuring the extent to which this relationship changed between 1982 and 2002. This research will obtain sales, employees, other available firm data for 2002, and the survival experience of the firm through 2006, or the latest available year. This study will also link the firms to improve the measures of business survival beyond the snapshots taken in 1986 and 1996. This research will use the linked data for longitudinal analyses of owner age and business performance. This will contribute to the understanding of business formation, early lifecycle dynamics of firms and the precursors to job creation in the U.S. economy. The project will create estimates of the impact of age of business owners on the performance of small businesses. It will also develop linkages between the SBO, the CBO, and the newly created ILBD. Using those linkages, it will enrich the 2002 SBO with variables which were not included in that survey, but were included in the earlier CBO surveys. This will enhance both the value of the 2002 SBO because of the inclusion of the new variables and the value of the earlier CBO surveys because of the existence of comparable data in another year. It will also enhance all three surveys by providing measures of firm survival and the transition from nonemployer to employer status.",4,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,William D Bradford,Yoonsoo Lee,Marek Zapletal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It investigates outsourcing’s effects on prices and price-cost margins within the plants of outsourcing firms. Finally, it tests the hypothesis that offshore outsourcing decisions are driven by profit maximization. These effects and relationships are examined using U.S. Census Bureau data (Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Business Register, and the Auxiliary Establishment File), merged with Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Compustat North America information on outsourcing and a range of firm-level characteristics. Research on the effects of offshore outsourcing will provide benefits to both the Census Bureau and its pro­grams in three significant areas. The analysis of the correlation between census plant death dates and TAA plant closing data will make available new information on and improved census capabilities in both measuring and predicting plant deaths. The research on offshore outsourcing necessitates the creation of a bridge between TAA data and census business datasets. Through linking census data to previously unavailable TAA variables, such as employee layoffs and plant closing dates, this bridge enhances census data.

A vast literature documents positive relationships between the wages and productivity of ﬁrms and various measures of agglomeration, eﬀects that persist even after control-ling for a broad array of worker, ﬁrm, and other local area characteristics. In many cases, researchers attribute the positive observed eﬀects of spatial agglomeration on diﬀerent outcome variables as evidence of agglomeration economies, suggesting that there may be knowledge spillovers or externalities associated with the geographic clustering of economic activity. This project explores the role of selection in explaining observed agglomeration eﬀects using the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD provides detailed geographic classiﬁcations that permit construction of measures of agglomeration at ﬁne geographic levels. This research will shed light on the sources of observed agglomeration eﬀects, the drivers behind diﬀerential rates of ﬁrm turnover and economic growth across geo-graphic areas, and the potential ramiﬁcations of policies aimed at encouraging or discouraging clustered business activity.

Theory suggests that, if a firm is not fully aware of the cost efficiency of an insurance company health care network, it will have to pay a premium to distinguish between the more and less efficient networks. Either asymmetric information or adverse selection exists since the insurance company knows its own quality or cost efficiency while its client(s) may not. If the insurance company charges too high a ""quality"" premium on some of its plans, thereby revealing its affordability and efficiency types, firms need to decide which plans continue to meet a minimum efficiency level and remain affordable based on the revealed insurance company type. This project will measure the efficiency of different plan options and estimate the cut-off efficiency value that firms from different sectors can afford to finance. In the process, this study will promote an understanding of why some sectors with high demand for health care and a given premium structure do not offer health insurance plans, whereas other sectors offer multiple options to their employees despite low demand.",14,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Form 5500 Bridge File,F55BF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Sandra Campo,Daria M Pelech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

705,Completed,Internal Corporate Governance and Plant-Level Productivity,Boston,2009,2013.0,Xavier A Giroud,"This project will investigate how internal corporate gover­nance, measured by the quality of headquarters’ monitoring of individual plants, affects plant productivity and other plant-level attributes. The plant-level data used in this project are obtained from the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database. The researchers will develop two measures of internal corporate governance. The first measure is the distance (physical distance or traveling time) between headquarters and individual plants. The second measure for the quality of monitoring is the “industry closeness” between the plant and headquarters. This measure reflects the idea that headquarters understands better, and thus finds it easier to monitor, a plant that operates in an industry with which headquarters is familiar. Plant productivity will be measured by total factor productiv­ity, operating margin, and labor productivity. Three main types of regressions will be estimated. The first type of regression looks at the direct (cross-sectional) relationship between productivity and internal corporate governance. The second type of regression examines whether the productivity gains (or losses) after a change of ownership can be explained by the difference in internal cor­porate governance. The third type of regression investigates if and how internal corporate governance amplifies (or mitigates) plant-level productivity shocks (state labor laws, natural disasters, oil and electricity shocks, opening of airports and golf courses in a neighborhood of the plant). Finally, plant-level measures of internal corporate governance will be aggregated into firm-level measures of internal corporate governance (e.g., the “weighted average distance” between headquarters and the firm’s plants) that can be used to investigate the role of internal corporate governance at the firm level (e.g., for equity prices or the conglomerate discount).",9,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
707,Completed,Dynamic Models of Reallocation,Baruch,2009,2014.0,Allan G Collard-Wexler,"Reallocation can take several forms, such as greater investment in more productive plants, entry of plants using a newer technology such as mini-mills, or exit of plants exposed to international trade. Economists care about reallocation at the plant level because of its role in generating improvement in aggregate productivity. In contrast to previous work on reallocation, this project will explicitly model the forward-looking choices of firms. When a firm decides to open a new ready-mix concrete plant, or shut down a steel mill because of foreign competition, it does so because it’s expectation of the net present value of profits are greater than the cost of either shutting down the plant or opening a new one. This project is composed of several separate subprojects designed to look at the forward-looking choices made by firms in different industries and how these generate reallocation. Changes in the ownership of establishments and establishing longitudinal links for firms over time will be used to evaluate the quality of the Master Business Register. The proposed analysis of changes in productivity will inform the quality of measurement of inputs and outputs in the economic census. In addition, several new estimates will be produced that relate to measurement error in productivity and the economic mechanisms driving reallocation of production towards more efficient units. This study will document the role of reallocation and entry and exit in shaping the productivity dispersion in the ready-mix concrete sector, as well as the role of measurement error of output and inputs in economic census questionnaires. Changes in the ownership of plants will be examined to identify the quality of Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) in census data. Since multi-plant ownership is associated with lower exit rates, the ownership of plants matters. This project will provide insight into the decision of firms to sell off assets, as well as the entry and exit decisions of firms rather than plants. It will analyze the effect of trade on plants in the textile and steel sectors. These sectors have been exposed to substantial changes in the strength of international competition over the last 30 years, due principally to the elimination of tariffs and quotas. This analysis will shed light on how the trade environment affected the speed of reallocation of resources such as employment and physical capital across plants in these sectors of the economy and whether this resulted in aggregate productivity gains. Prices of imported steel and textiles will permit the researchers to decompose changes in sales to changes in both the price and quantity produced.",11,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Raluca Dragusanu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

710,Completed,Impacts of trade on wage inequality across U.S. regions: analysis using matched employer-employee data,UCLA,2010,2013.0,David Rigby,"Wage inequality has increased rapidly in the US since the late 1970s. Imports to the US, especially those from low-wage developing economies, have risen over the same period. Standard trade theory links these trends and provides one explanation for the rise in relative wages of more skilled workers. However, most empirical studies have failed to find a strong connection between  trade and wage inequality.

712,Completed,Measuring Uncertainty Over the Business Cycle,Berkeley,2009,2014.0,Nicholas A Bloom,"This project investigates the role of variations in the level of uncertainty as a key driver of the business cycle. The most important piece of this research is construction of time series measures of uncertainty. This project is to inform the U.S. Census Bureau on four issues. One, the project will help to improve the quality of data produced by the Census Bureau. By constructing measures of volatility from census micro datasets and comparing these with external measures of volatility, the likely extent of measurement error in the census datasets can be evaluated. Two, it will lead to an improved methodology for tabulating aggregate statistics derived from census data. The analysis will aim to highlight the significance of time variation in the dispersion of establishment-level data. The project would then lead to a recommendation to display aggregate variances at yearly intervals. Three, it will help to prepare estimates of nonresponse over the business cycle that are driven by fluctuations in volatility. To estimate changes in volatility over the business cycle, changes in data imputation must be controlled for in the analysis. This project will spend considerable time evaluating the cyclical and industrial properties of nonresponse. Four, the project will help to improve survey estimation techniques by identifying periods of time and industries with higher levels of underlying volatility. If recessions change the response rate of establishments to the surveys, then the requisite increase in the amount of imputed data could generate cyclical bias.",7,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,Nicholas A Bloom,Max F Floetotto,Daniel J Grodzicki,Nir Jaimovich,Itay Saporta Eksten,Stephen J Terry,Edison G Yu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
716,Completed,Changes in Firm Pension Policy: The Case of Cash Balance Plan Conversion,Michigan,2009,2013.0,Kandice A Kapinos,"This study investigates the determinants of private pension plan conversions from traditional defined benefit plans to hybrid cash balance plans during the 1990s. It examines whether there are systematic differences in the types of firms and plans that converted. It also examines the endogenous rela­tionship between the likelihood of conversion (on pension plan type, in general) and employee turnover. The project utilizes data from several sources for this analysis. Information on pension plan characteristics comes from the annual 5500 forms which most private sector firms file each year in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). From the PBGC also comes information on plan terminations. These data are linked to the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, which provide information about establishment-level characteristics of the workforce. Firm level data from Compustat provide several important firm-level characteristics. The research intends to improve the link between the Form 5500 data and the Business Register. It will also compare data from the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Surveys to Form 5500 data in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset in studying firm human resource policies. It will also establish evidence on the determinants of employer provided pension plan policy changes and provide estimates of population characteristics relating to changes in employer provided pension plan coverage rates.",13,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2008,LEHD-ECF-2008,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2008,LEHD-EHF-2008,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2008,LEHD-ICF-2008,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Joel A Cobb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

719,Completed,Understanding Firm Investment,Baruch,2009,2013.0,Joan Farre-Mensa,"Understanding the determinants of firm investment is an important question at the heart of the economic discipline. The difficulty of empirically analyzing the factors that drive firm investment arises from the fact that investment is highly volatile throughout the business cycle and responds to a wide variety of global and local economic shocks. One of the main open questions regarding the determinants of firm investment is how equity income taxation affects a firm’s cost of capital and thus its incentives to invest. This research uses the tax cuts in dividends and capital gains included in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 in order to shed light on this question. This project uses data from the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, and the Survey of Industrial Research and Development to construct a panel of plants spanning from 1994 to 2007. Other U.S. Census Bureau data will be employed in order to match the census datasets with other American and international databases. The main assumption is that only firms incorporated in the United States, and thus with a majority of shareholders subject to U.S. tax law, will be potentially affected by a decrease in the cost of capital induced by the 2003 equity income tax cuts. The analysis will control for those plant and firm characteristics identified as determinants of investment and will be able to attribute any differences in investment between plants that only differ in the country of incorporation of their parent firms to the effects of changes in equity income taxation, effec­tively differencing away those determinants of investment related to the business cycle and other local and global economic shocks that impact profitability. Census microdata also allows for quantification of the effect of those other variables identified as potential determinants of investment. The focus on a time period around a sizeable tax reform represents a unique opportunity to obtain estimates less subject to severe measurement error, given that changes in taxation induce firms to reevaluate their investment levels in order to reflect the new economic environment. The analysis of investment can shed light on how constant capital expenditures are across time, and thus help design imputation strategies for nonresponse in capital expenditures survey questions. The link between census datasets and several international databases will provide financial information for those foreign-incorporated companies that own plants in the United States. This link will enable an assessment of the quality of the ownership data contained in the census files and can be useful to analyze the characteristics of multinational companies that own plants in the United States.",8,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Joan Farre-Mensa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
729,Completed,"Using Establishment-Level, Longitudinal Data to Examine the Effect of Emissions on Health Outcomes",Michigan,2009,2013.0,Lucas W Davis,"Exposure to environmental emissions may be an important determinant of health outcomes, but it is difficult to obtain scientific evidence on this point given the infeasibility of conducting randomized experiments. This research examines the relationship between emis­sions and health outcomes using establishment-level data in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and linked establishment-level surveys (the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Census of Mining, the Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities, and the Census of Wholesale Trade) merged with publicly-available information about emissions. The research design will exploit the precise record of establishment openings and closings in the LBD to identify effects on health outcomes. The first objective of this project is to evaluate the accuracy of establishment openings and closings in the LBD by merg­ing the LBD with establishments in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). The second objective of the project is to generate new estimates of the effect of indus­trial emissions on human mortality. The U.S. Census Bureau’s National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) is a database designed for studying the effects of demographic and socio-economic characteristics on mortality rates. The estimates will help realize the objective of the NLMS, helping the Census Bureau better understand the role of environmental factors as a determinant of human mortality, as well as to better understand the extent to which industrial emissions have been a confounding factor in existing studies of mortality using the NLMS.",7,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Janet M Currie,Lucas W Davis,David J Munroe,William R Walker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Senior management turnover events are typically followed by operational changes as well as asset restructurings, such as plant sales and acquisitions. Matched information from SDC will allow us to identify plants that change hands around the time of turnover in the management team, and to track factor productivity for both the sold and the remaining assets. We will study managers' incentives to divest underperforming assets, and whether better corporate governance leads to more timely and efficient management replacement decisions. We will also explore long-run trends in corporate governance, investment, and firms' organizational structures.
We will estimate the overall change in plant performance, as measured by total factor productivity (TFP), following managerial turnover. We will also use the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) to examine if the financial position of the firm improves following management change, and what the interplay between changes in TFP and changes in firm financial performance might be. Detail drivers behind any pre- and post-turnover performance changes will be explored, such as plant factor efficiency, employment changes using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD-ECF/QWI) data, plant utilization from the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (PCU), asset sales, including the sale of plants or segments of the firm, capital investment from the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES), research and development investment from the Research and Development (R&D) survey, or the acquisition of other plants as captured in the LBD and Ownership Change Database (OCD). Census and SDC files will be linked using the Compustat-SSEL bridge file, the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL-NA), and the LEHD bridge files (BRB/GAL). Firms' asset management decisions affect various measures collected in Census Bureau data programs, including measures of investment and the purchase and sale of establishments and other firms.

These objectives will be accomplished by linking an external dataset of establishments receiving business assistance between 1999 and 2007 to census datasets. The project uses the external dataset of business assistance recipients to both validate and improve the quality of census data. The data will be used to identify limitations of the census sampling frame, measure data quality, estimate nonresponse bias, and improve imputations for nonresponse in census datasets. The business assistance dataset is valuable because it contains data at the same level of resolution and contains some of the same data elements as census datasets. The project uses the linked datasets to explore determinants of establishment productivity not currently measured in census datasets. Specifically, the research explores how manufacturing establishment performance is affected by business assistance and how the effects vary across measurable dimensions. The analysis focuses on business assistance provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership between 1999 and 2007. The project employs a variety of econometric approaches, primarily relying on an instrumental variables approach to estimate how measures of establishment performance such as productivity, output, and employment growth are affected by different types and levels of business assistance.

753,Completed,The Human Factor in Corporate Restructuring Decisions,UCLA,2009,2013.0,Liu A Yang,"This study analyzes the link between the characteristics of firms’ labor forces (the human factor) and corporate restructuring decisions, such as plant closure and acquisitions. Specifically, it will analyze whether the labor composition and the wage structure of a plant or firm affects its probability of being shut down or of becoming a takeover target, and how factors such as experience, human capital, and wages explain the cross-sectional differences in worker retention decisions and firm performance following an acquisition or plant closure. The project uses employee information from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program, firm-level information from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), financial data from Compustat and information on corporate restructuring from the SDC Platinum Mergers and Acquisitions database. Additional data on manufacturing industries includes plant-level information from the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures to construct sharper estimates of changes in plant-level productivity around restructuring events. The project will evaluate the consistency of various databases maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and analyze the implications of any inconsistencies on census published statistics. Accurate information on corporate restructuring is especially important for time series and worker statistics, such as those produced by the LEHD program. Moreover, since the SDC data documents the time when restructuring becomes effective in the legal sense and census databases record the time when real changes are made (in terms of labor and capital), comparing these two sources will provide valuable information on the length of the integration process. Statistics on the changes in workforce composition and the change in the wage distribution after restructuring will be produced. Econometric models will estimate the effects of employee characteristics and the wage distribution on the likelihood of plant closure or takeover.",15,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2008,LEHD-ECF-2008,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2008,LEHD-EHF-2008,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2008,LEHD-ICF-2008,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2008,LEHD-QWI-2008,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2008,LEHD-U2W-2008,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Kenneth Ahern,Geoffrey A Tate,Liu A Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
755,Completed,Synthetic Data Generation for Small Area Estimation,Michigan,2009,2012.0,Trivellore E Raghunathan,"Sample surveys are a crucial source of information about the state of public health and people’s quality of life. Moreover, they provide an efficient way to identify and monitor illness and disability trends and track progress toward achieving the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Health Protection Goals. Increasingly, this information is being demanded in the form of small area statistics to monitor health trends and support policy decisions in small geographic areas, including those that are typically underrepresented in large-scale data collection projects. However, the CDC is often prevented from releasing small area identifiers in public-use datasets because the data do not satisfy certain disclosure restrictions. This research tests and evaluates a new method for generating public-use micro-level datasets that contain enough geographical detail to permit small area estimation without compromising the confidentiality of survey respondents. The method uses the observed survey data to fit a statistical imputation model that generates synthetic data records, which comprise the public-use data records. The synthetic data are generated to emulate the observed data and preserve important statistical properties of the observed data. Moreover, the synthetic data can account for the hierarchical clustering structure associated with multiple levels of geography; thus, permitting data users to perform various geographical analyses with a single dataset. Confidentiality protection is greatly enhanced because no actual data values are released to the public. The proposed methodology is tested and evaluated using confidential data from the National Health Interview Survey. Synthetic versions of this data source will be generated for key variables relevant to national health objectives. Various parametric and non-parametric imputation models capable of handling different variable types will be investigated.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding how the degree of returns to scale shapes the production of investment goods will be instrumental for the U.S. Census Bureau to understand establishment-level data. Constructing a comprehensive panel of manufacturing firms and estimating production functions can identify the degree of returns to scale at the establishment level. Regressing output on factor inputs will deliver the degree of returns to scale. Prices for equipment and structure investment behave very differently which suggests differential technologies and returns to scale. To pay special attention to that difference, the Census of Construction Industries is used to contrast construction firms to manufacturing establishments. This project benefits the Census Bureau by correcting for measurement error, imputing capital stock for manufacturing establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures, seasonally adjusting older (annual) Plant Capacity Utilization data, and estimating capacity utilization for a large population of manufacturing plants that is not covered at present. This project will also deliver a precise estimate of the degree of returns to scale that is free from aggregation bias.

765,Completed,Should My Car Move or Should We? An Intra-Household Model of Residential and Commuting Choices,Triangle,2010,2014.0,Christopher M Clapp,"Empirical evidence shows that family members bargain over nondurable household consumption decisions. It stands to reason that they also bargain over more longstanding decisions such as modes of transportation. In order to gain a better understanding of congestion, one must consider both the interplay between residential and commuting mode choices, and how those decisions are made within the family. Using data from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), this research develops a joint model of family residential choice and commuting method. It aims to make four key contributions to the literature. First, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, this work is the first to explicitly model both residential and commuting choices together using nationwide, individual level data.  Other research controls for distance to the head of household's job in a residential choice model but focuses on Tiebout sorting in housing markets, not commuting decisions. Second, the model does not treat households as unified decision making entities. This research uses the collective household model to improve upon the current residential choice literature, which treats multi-person households as single agents. Third, the framework here allows for an additional empirical test of the hypothesis that the collective model accurately approximates household behavior. Finally, the ultimate goal of this work is to conduct simulations that predict the land use impacts of congestion pricing and other transportation strategies. These simulations can be used to evaluate the costs and benefits of these strategies.",3,American Community Survey,ACS,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata,ACSUNEDIT,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Christopher M Clapp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the procedures for imputing missing or invalid values exist only for variables included in the MEPS-IC published estimates because developing these procedures requires resources. In the process of constructing the linked data sets, comparisons will also be made across these three nationally representative datasets: the MEPS IC, the MEPS HC, and the LEHD-ICF. This project will prepare estimates that model establishment offers of insurance, take-up rates, plan choice, total premiums, and employer premium contributions as a function of establishment and workforce characteristics. The researchers will examine multivariate models and bivariate associations to determine whether these newly imputed variables (e.g., percent over age 50) are predictive of these outcomes. They will evaluate the usefulness of the newly imputed variables in producing new estimates. They will also examine newly linked LEHD-ICF variables (e.g., race, citizenship and education) to see if they are predictive of outcomes of interest. This will provide evidence of the potential value of adding these new variables to the MEPS IC survey. This project will inform the U.S. Census Bureau about both employer behavior and also the linked behavior of employers and their employees with respect to the following topics: the effect of current tax subsidies on employer sponsored insurance, the revenue effects and incidence of reforms that cap tax subsidies, the effect of “tax price” on establishment and worker behavior, and the effect of reforms on establishment and worker behavior.",3,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2008,LEHD-ICF-2008,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Blaine D Byars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

776,Completed,Income Effects in Labor Supply: Evidence from Census Demographic Microdata,Berkeley,2011,2014.0,Philippe . Wingender,"This research project uses timing of childbirth to measure the income effect of taxes on parents' labor supply. The IRS Residency Test states that families can claim a dependent for the entire fiscal year if the child was born at any time during the year, and therefore provides an exogenous source of variation in tax liabilities for births that occur late in the year versus those that occur early the following year. By measuring the difference in earnings in the subsequent year for parents of December and January births, we can identify the impact of a one-time non-labor income shock on parents' labor supply since both groups face on average the same future stream of tax rates after birth. Preliminary results using public-use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and cross-sectional data from the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that a temporary increase in after-tax income leads to a significant decrease in mothers' earnings with an estimated income effect of -0.9. This calls for a better understanding of the income effect of taxes of earnings, an important parameter that has not been studied carefully in previous work.  Restricted data from the 2000 Census Long Form and the ACS can alleviate the shortcomings of the current public-use datasets: coarse information on date of birth and small samples. This research will produce a new estimate of the income effect, an important characteristic of the US population that has been overlooked in previous work. The few previous studies that have incorporated measures of non-labor income in earnings elasticity estimations have all done so in the context of tax reform. This research project is the first one to look directly at changes in non-labor income's impact on earnings arising from taxes, resulting in a more transparent identification strategy and greater statistical power.",3,American Community Survey,ACS,American Community Survey Unedited Microdata,ACSUNEDIT,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project compares employment and wages across the data files of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the economic census, and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Employer Characteristics File. Cross comparison of employment and wages from the three separate sources will establish whether reporting variance can be duplicated across sources, methods for the allocation of firm based R&D expenditure to establishments, and investigate recall bias for employment measures in the economic census. Recall bias will be quantified for economic census respondents that report March 12 employment that has a closer match to fourth quarter LEHD employment or first quarter employment for the following year, in comparison to first quarter LEHD employment for the March 12 period of the economic census year. Fourth quarter or first quarter of the following year employment is closer to the timing of when economic census survey forms are mailed out. The extent of recall bias will be related to firm characteristics, for example as captured by worker turnover statistics in the Quarterly Workforce Indicators. The project will produce population estimates of establishment and individual wage distributions and wage dynamics. The project will also produce population estimates of the effect of R&D activity on firm productivity. As a complement to the firm based analyses, the research will investigate wage distributions over time, coming from the perspective of the worker and using the Current Population Survey. The data will allow the follow­ing of workers from firm to firm and measure the R&D content of their working experience.

With quarterly data on the earnings and geographic location of workers from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, the proposed research will model the process of labor market adjustment by following individual workers over time.  This unique data will allow us to both model the short term effects that are missed by other studies using Census data as well as document the longer-term effects on workers affected by immigration in specific industries.  The study will carefully analyze the impact of skill complementarities between native and immigrant workers by occupation, within detailed industries, and at the firm level. 
The research proposes to link the Current Population Survey March Supplement to the LEHD using the PIK-CPS crosswalk.  In addition to the LEHD Employer Characteristic File (ECF), this project needs the LEHD Employment History Files (EHF), the LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF), the LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), the LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL), and the LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) Impute files.

Its objective is to support ongoing research on college-going behavior among high school graduates. This work focuses on the college-going behavior of youth residing near college taxing districts. It exploits the abrupt change in tuition costs at college taxing district boundaries to estimate price elasticities of demand for higher education. For this proposal, we use household data from the restricted-version of the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey to test a key identifying assumption: college-age youth on opposite, yet adjacent, sides of community college taxing district boundaries are similar along observable dimensions. This work will enhance the utility Census Bureau data in two ways. First, it contributes to developing means of increasing the utility of Census Bureau data for analyzing public programs and policies. Accordingly, the project will link census blocks for a large state with detailed information on college taxing district attributes such as tuition levels and property tax rates.

813,Completed,Accuracy of Same-sex Couple Data in the American Community Survey,UCLA,2011,2014.0,Gary J Gates,"A significant amount of the research on same-sex couples in the United States uses the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) as primary data sources. With the advent of legal marriage and other forms of recognition for these couples, interest in this group has intensified. This project will help determine if new procedures used in the 2008 ACS have improved the reliability and accuracy of data on same-sex couples, especially those where one partner is designated as a spouse. Beginning with the 2008 ACS, the Census Bureau now formally releases estimates of same-sex spouses (prior to this change, all same-sex partners designated as ""husband"" or ""wife"" were reclassified as ""unmarried partners""). This only increases the urgency of assessing the reliability of the same-sex couple data, especially same-sex spouses.
Research suggests that a potentially large fraction of same-sex spouses may actually be comprised of different-sex spouses who miscode their sex. This project compares data from the 2007 and 2008 ACS to assess whether the new 2008 ACS data collection and editing procedures yield greater accuracy of responses and improve the reliability of the same-sex spousal data.  The primary research goal is to verify the extent of the measurement error using explicit identification of same-sex spouses. The use of data that includes original unedited responses to the household roster and variables associated with marital status and sex will allow a determination of whether the changes in the 2008 ACS data result in a more accurate enumeration of same-sex spouses. A second goal is to consider how state-level differences in responses to household roster and marital status questions may be associated with variation in the legal and social climate regarding recognition of same-sex relationships.",1,American Community Survey,ACS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Gary J Gates,Michael D Steinberger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We plan to define this in a number of ways, but the general idea is to contrast the impulse response from a large and unanticipated inflow of new money directed from the capital markets to an inflow directed from the public sector (direct government transfer), which is explicitly not functioning through the capital markets.

Our research aims to fill this gap by investigating the role of agents and brokers in the health insurance decisions of small businesses, a sector that is particularly vulnerable to potential problems regarding health insurance financing. We will investigate whether the structure of the market for health insurance agents and brokers is associated with outcomes such as the likelihood of shopping for coverage, offering coverage, high deductible plans and health savings accounts. The data on the market for insurance agents and brokers will be based on the membership database of the National Association of Health Underwriters. We will merge this data with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component, a nationally representative sample of employers along with information on their health insurance offerings and characteristics of the policies offered, as well as other information at the employer level.

828,Completed,Does Organizational Innovation Complement Technology Adoption?,Boston,2018,2022.0,Kristina S Steffenson McElheran,"We propose a series of related analyses to understand the nature of technology-related organizational capital. Our first analysis attempts to gain further insight into the organizational innovations wrought by Enterprise-Resource-Planning (ERP) systems on the economy. By combining Census data sets with our ERP data from Harte Hanks and SAP, we can study how ERP systems have affected organizational change at both the plant and the firm level. Among firms that adopted ERP systems, how did their operations change? Which plants were closed and how was production reallocated? A purpose of this analysis is to examine what internal changes differentiated the most successful implementers of this new technology from the ones that were less successful.
Our other analyses concern the relationship between IT and the dynamic nature of the U.S. economy. The first phenomenon we want to explore in this stream of research is that of persistent firm heterogeneity. Are there greater and more persistent differences in performance between the leading and lagging firms in IT-intensive industries? We are also interested in whether there is greater “Schumpeterian” creative destruction in the most IT-intensive industries. Do the most productive firms in one period generate a greater share of output in the next period? Does the answer change depending on the intensity of IT usage in the industry? Are there more firm births and deaths in these industries? We are also interested in further exploring the relationship between IT and firm size, and examine the distribution of employment in industries by size and IT usage.",22,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,National Employer Survey,NES,Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization,PCU,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,James Bessen,Naomi Hausman,Wang Jin,Cesare Righi,Adam R Saunders,Kristina S Steffenson McElheran,Xiupeng Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One objective of this study is to provide such evidence through an examination of patterns in Community Rating System (CRS) scores across a panel of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) communities. In the process, this work will benefit the Census Bureau by developing means for increasing the utility of Bureau-collected data, linking relevant external data, and producing population estimates. The researchers will test a number of hypotheses previously offered to explain why some local governments adopt hazard mitigation but others do not. Research will focus on flood hazard mitigation projects in 1104 NFIP communities in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 2005 and 2009, but the results will generalize across other flood-prone communities around the nation.

831,Completed,Productivity over Time and Space:  Estimates for States and Counties 1976 - 2007,Baruch,2011,2014.0,Lucy M Goodhart,"This project will estimate plant-level total factor productivity (TFP) for manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the period 1976 to 2005, and will use these estimates to calculate aggregate or average TFP by state, MSA, and county. The project will examine how spatial divergence across states and counties has changed over the sample period. This analysis is prompted by findings that investments in information and communications technology are complementary with the existing base of human capital and skills in a given location. Given that U.S. cities are increasingly divergent in their stocks of human capital, the research tests whether productivity in manufacturing has also become more geographically disparate. A second objective is to test whether local area productivity is related to earnings and employment outcomes at the individual level and to individuals' attitudes towards trade liberalization and government spending. This component is motivated by a literature on the consequences of productivity for workers, relating productivity to wages and risk of job loss. Using the data on average TFP by state, county, and MSA from the first part of this project, the second component tests the effect of aggregate TFP in manufacturing in the local area on earnings and employment using data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey. Finally, and given the links drawn between risks to employment and earnings and individual attitudes towards trade liberalization and government spending, the research tests whether aggregate TFP in the local area correlates with these individual attitudes.

Work will focus on manufacturing firms but will also investigate how banking law changes affect other sectors of the economy. The research uses the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QPC), the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Census of Manufactures (CMF), and the Longitudinal Business Database to analyze the effects of banking deregulation on plant-level output, employment, investment, productivity, and capital-to-labor ratios. Further, the project investigates the influence of banking deregulation on the market selection process and the reallocation of resources across manufacturing plants. The study will also use the Survey of Business Owners and the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database to provide a direct research link between credit markets and the productive sector by identifying firms that use debt to finance startup capital. This will allow the researchers to investigate whether banking deregulation affects access to credit for new businesses or the future performance and asset accumulation of borrowing firms. The research will benefit the Census Bureau by studying the quality of the data in the recently launched QPC. The researchers will compare the data in the QPC to data in the ASM and CMF, in addition to using the QPC (and it predecessor, the annual Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization) to study variation in capacity utilization rates across states.

861,Completed,Exploring How Neighborhood Quality Influences Household Residential Choices,Baruch,2011,2016.0,Keren M Horn,"Understanding which factors attract households to particular neighborhoods provides a critical lens into neighborhood change. Previous research has found that the neighborhood choices of in-moving households are important drivers of neighborhood change. We still know very little about what neighborhood factors drive these location decisions. This research project explores whether the quality of the zoned public school, the crime rate, and/or the racial composition of a neighborhood differentially attract particular types of households to that neighborhood. Four key dimensions of households – their tenure, income, race, and presence of children – provide the focus for this research.  Using the internal versions of the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, and the American Housing Survey, along with rich external datasets describing neighborhood characteristics, this project will overcome existing data limitations that have prevented researchers from gaining insight into how neighborhood quality influences household residential choices. These detailed microdata will be employed to estimate separately which neighborhood factors attract households to particular neighborhoods and then model household neighborhood choice, incorporating information on previous residence to improve the specification.  Part of this project will conduct an in-depth exploration of item response rates in each of the different surveys used in order to gain a sense of the quality of the data on previous residence. It will take advantage of the changes in the ways in which the question is asked to see how changing the phrasing of the previous residence variable influences item response rates. We will also examine how differences in survey administration influence item response rates.

Estimating the causal impact of the Pill has been difficult because of the coincidence of its release with the peak of the baby boom, the rise of the women's movement, and many other social changes that render standard inter-temporal comparisons invalid. Bailey (2010) developed a quasi-experimental empirical strategy to address these problems. Specifically, she uses state-level variation in anti-obscenity ""Comstock laws"" which made the Pill illegal in 24 states, in conjunction with the timing of the introduction of the Pill in 1957 and the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Connecticut's Comstock statute in 1965 with Griswold v.

The “net advantage” of dropping health insurance reflects an establishment's assessment of the potential value of exchange-based premium assistance credits (subsidies) that its workers could get if the employer dropped coverage; the value of the tax subsidy associated with offering health insurance; and the cost of the employer-shared responsibility requirement that an employer would incur if it dropped coverage. In addition, we will quantify the relationship between an employer's propensity to offer insurance and the tax price of insurance among workers in the establishment, characteristics of the establishment and its workforce, labor market conditions, and competition in the market for health insurance by modeling an employer's decision to offer health insurance. Finally, we will predict how economic incentives facing employers will alter their incentives to provide health insurance. 
The MEPS-IC are critical for analyzing the proposed issues as no other nationally representative data set exists that contains detailed information on health benefit offerings, premiums, and workforce composition of U.S. establishments. The resulting analyses will inform the Census Bureau about the relation between health insurance provision by employers and the economic incentives that businesses face, which are driven in large part by the characteristics of their workers and their families. We will develop methods to enhance the information contained in the MEPS-IC with respect to measuring an establishment's workforce composition, including estimating the wage distribution of full-time workers within establishments who are most likely to be eligible for health insurance. We will also develop methods to facilitate a comparison of the distribution of wage income reported for workers relative to the distribution of household income by workers in establishments. These analyses can facilitate a more complete assessment of employers' changing incentives to offer health insurance and they can test the sensitivity of how particular assumptions about employer behavior affect the offering decision. The proposed research also will benefit the Census Bureau by providing population estimates of establishment offers of health insurance under existing economic incentives and offers a flexible model for understanding how employer behavior may change in light of new economic incentives (e.g., differences by state or under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010).",1,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Jean M Abraham,Roger D Feldman,Peter F Graven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
880,Completed,"Business Cycles, Business Dynamics and Firm Behavior",Michigan,2013,2024.0,Francine Lafontaine,"The goal of this project is to provide insights into the microeconomic underpinnings and effects of business cycles. A key goal is to extend the existing literature by examining the effects of the recent ""great recession"" and the consequent (ongoing) recovery. Another goal is to examine these issues for firms operating in the retail and service sectors. Most of the literature to date has focused on manufacturing industries, which represent a decreasing portion of GDP in the U.S. and other developed economies. The project will consist of three main parts. First, we will study the effects of business cycles on entry and exit of employer establishments, as well as transitions between non-employer and employer status, controlling for the effect of other important variables such as area demographics, establishment as well as industry characteristics, market size, and regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to entry. Second, we will study the impact of the business cycle and local financial conditions on investment behavior as well as business growth. Finally, we will study how firm pricing decisions vary over the business cycle. Our primary sources of data will be the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) and the Current Industrial Reports (CIR) maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau, which we will complement with other public use data to which we have access.

884,Completed,The Dynamics of Participation in Subsidized Housing Programs in the US: Pathways into and out of Subsidized Housing,UCLA,2011,2014.0,Yana A Kucheva,"At the end of the 1990s, the federal government reorganized the way it provides subsidized housing assistance. As a result, voucher users surpassed the number of public housing residents, and Public Housing Authorities began to serve new tenants who are making affirmative steps to self-sufficiency as opposed to households experiencing the greatest housing-related needs. Using life table analysis, this project investigates how these changes have affected the length of stay of tenants in subsidized housing programs as well as the relative lengths of stay in public housing compared to other types of subsidized programs. Second, it examines the pathways that residents take to exit subsidized housing and implement a discrete-time multinomial logit model of the socioeconomic determinants of exits into the private housing market that takes account not only of the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals but also of the local housing and unemployment conditions. Finally, it traces the ability of exits from subsidized housing programs to improve the living conditions of the ones who transition into the private housing market.

Specifically, the research will compare the relative importance of socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity as predictors of observed settlement patterns for households that move into southern metropolitan areas during recent decades.  In the process of making these comparisons, the researchers will examine differential trends in locational attainment between races for inter-urban migrants, intra-urban migrants, and non-migrants in southern U.S. metropolitan areas.  Results will provide a test of how well certain models predict the observed settlement and distribution patterns of movers during the time period under study, and in the process will establish the basis for better understanding the predictive role of migration when studying the locational attainment of African Americans.
Locational attainment refers to neighborhood quality as measured by variables such as poverty, crime rates, housing values, pollution levels, unemployment, and school quality.  This study will determine if locational attainment differences exist between particular groups of inter-urban migrants, and if so, what factors underlie such differences.  Similar analyses will compare locational attainment for inter-urban migrants with that of  intra-urban and non-migrants, based on questions in the aforementioned Decennial Censuses and the ACS about having moved in the past year (ACS) or five years (Decennial).  The assimilation model predicts that SES is the only important predictor of the settlement and distribution patterns of movers.  Alternatively, other models posit that racial and ethnic distributions underlie these patterns.  This study will determine which model best describes the patterns observed in the microdata from 1970 to 2008 and beyond.  This time period is of particular importance to the researchers, whose interest lies in studying the trend in migration of African-Americans out of the South and into non-southern metropolitan areas in the decades preceding 1970, coupled with the more recent decadal trends reversing this process as Blacks return to the South and disproportionately settle in growing Southern metropolitan areas.

Specifically, the project will examine the impact that business assistance programs have on employment and revenue growth for small employers across all sectors of the economy. Two types of business assistance programs available during the 1992-1997 time period will be assessed:

o 	privately-run, business incubation programs designed to aid entrepreneurs by providing various business support services and resources, and
o 	the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program run by the Small Business Administration to provide research and development funds to small, high-tech, innovative businesses.

In conducting this research, this project will not only inform the Census Bureau about factors that affect small business performance but will also improve the understanding of the Census Bureau's data on these small businesses by conducting comparisons of the external data elements to the internal data to find discrepancies between the data sources and to determine if there are patterns in missing elements of the internal data.  Data elements within the Census in-house data sources and among the Census in-house and external sources will be cross-checked and cross-validated. Consequently, missing and inconsistent data elements in Title 13, Chapter 5 data will be identified to increase the understanding of the quality of data. Additionally, a methodology will be developed to estimate non-response for a Title 13, Chapter 5 program. The proposed research will focus on answering these key questions related to small business performance:
o 	Which key characteristics of individual owners, establishments, firms, industries, and the local region significantly affect small businesses' performance? 
o 	Do small business assistance programs - specifically, business incubation programs and the SBIR program - affect small businesses' performance, and do they enhance the effects of those key characteristics found to significantly affect small businesses' performance?

However, nonrandom mixtures of modes yield unknown bias properties for population estimates such as means and totals. This research project aims to develop statistical inference methods accounting for both nonresponse and nonrandom mode effects. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the most prominent survey that uses such a sequential mixed-mode survey design, and therefore is an important test bed for such empirical evaluations. This research will focus on two variables in particular, personal income and health insurance coverage, which the survey methodology literature suggests are subject to mode effects. The proposed method conceptualizes the sequential mixed-mode survey data as a special case of a missing data problem. The research outcome will be revised ACS microdata that are adjusted for nonresponse and nonrandom mode effects, and corresponding composite weights to compute population estimates from these microdata. Additionally, alternative subgroup allocations for nonresponse follow-up which aim to reduce cost or mean square error will be investigated under the ACS design.",3,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Zeynep T Suzer Gurtekin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1070,Completed,Improving the Connection between the Spatial and the Survey Sciences,Colorado,2013,2021.0,Seth E Spielman,"The Spatial Sciences Census Research Node (SSCRN) will foster a connection between the spatial and the survey sciences. This bridge will yield both immediate and long‐term benefits for the estimation, dissemination, and usability of the small area statistics produced by the Census Bureau. Small area statistics describe the character of the population within small geographic zones, such as census tracts, and can be imprecise. Apart from the impractical solution of increasing the sample size, the only way to reduce the uncertainty of survey estimates is to utilize ancillary information about the population. Historically, very little attention has been paid to the geographic distribution of populations within these small areas. This research will increase knowledge about the organization of the population within small geographic areas, and exploit new forms of geographic information and recent advances in spatial statistics, to make small area estimates more accurate. This project will develop software tools that will enhance the usability of small area estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) by allowing users to intelligently combine tracts to reduce uncertainty in variables of interest. In addition to improving small area population estimates, an improved understanding of the geographic micro‐structure of the U.S. population is of broad scientific interest and may expand knowledge about socio‐spatial processes like segregation and neighborhood effects.

1071,Active,Improving the Interpretability and Usability of the American Community Survey Through Hierarchical Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Statistical Models - NCRN,Missouri,2015,,Scott H Holan,"This project will use confidential microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) to provide an efficient framework for carrying out small area estimation (SAE), while preserving geographical and temporal constraints that arise from the survey’s aggregate structure. Further, by borrowing strength across multiple scales in space and time, and multiple outcomes, the proposed approach will reduce the variance in the ACS small area estimates and its derivatives. Additionally, from a data users perspective, methodology will be developed that will simultaneously provide coherent estimates on several temporal scales, rather than being hampered by the published multiyear estimates. Importantly, this will allow researchers to compare trends across different geographies. 
The proposed methods are of independent interest and can be used in many of the other surveys administered by US Census Bureau (and other Federal Statistics Agencies). For example, straightforward modification of the proposed methods can be used in conjunction with the Current Population Survey, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Agricultural Resource Management Survey, among others. Furthermore, several of the proposed methods (SAE) will directly carry over to the area of disease mapping and thus, provide important tools for public health. In short, the proposed methods provide novel solutions across a wide-range of applied problems, contributing to the statistics literature, Federal, State and Local governments and many subject matter disciplines.

1085,Completed,Home Equity  Lending and Small Business: Relaxing Credit Constraints in Texas,Atlanta,2014,2022.0,Ian M Schmutte,"This project uses integrated data to measure the characteristics and dynamics of small and non-employer businesses, and evaluates how well Census Bureau data products measure small business dynamics and the characteristics of small business owners. Home equity is an important source of capital for many small business ventures, but it is possible that the business activities of these marginal entrepreneurs are not well represented, or well measured in Census Bureau data. This research evaluates how measurement of small- and non-employer business characteristics and dynamics change with access to home equity. A change in Texas law provides a natural experiment to directly evaluate how well administrative and survey sources measure the characteristics and activity of business that rely on this form of financing. Economic growth may depend on the ability to convert personal property into liquid capital, but testing such a theory is difficult since it is hard to disentangle the effects of the ability to borrow from other institutional and economic variables. The Texas law change provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of changing one feature of the bundle of property rights that attach to home ownership. Specifically, the research design uses the variation in access to home equity financing induced by the law change to identify its influence on the formation and growth of small and young businesses.",4,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,William D Lastrapes,Zichong Qu,Ian M Schmutte,Jacob T Watson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1105,Completed,Labor Market Implications of External Shocks,Berkeley,2013,2017.0,William R Walker,"The ways in which external economic forces influence firm-level input and output decisions have important implications for economic welfare and social well-being. Firms and plant-owners often make decisions to maximize profits or shareholder value, and they may not fully internalize the effects of their production decisions on the local economy in which they are located. Similarly, firm owners or managers do not necessarily internalize the potential long run costs to workers when making plant layoff decisions. In some cases, these externalities create market failures. Addressing these externalities requires a proper understanding both of how external economic forces influence firm and worker decisions as well as how these decisions influence long run costs and economic incidence. This project will characterize how external market and non-market forces influence firm and worker behavior, while also evaluating the costs and incidence of sectoral reallocation of the labor market more generally. The researchers will evaluate the costs and incidence of sectoral reallocation in the labor market using the longitudinal earnings and employment records from the LEHD infrastructure file. This research will produce estimates quantifying how changes in demand drive employment responses and worker outcomes in the automobile industry and how demand shocks in a particular industry may propagate to nearby industries. The researchers will also evaluate how environmental regulation influences the type of worker hired at newly regulated firms.

1134,Completed,Firm Dynamics Across Sectors and Countries,Dallas,2015,2023.0,Mu-Jeung Yang,"In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis of 2008, employment growth in the U.S. economy was unusually sluggish compared to other postwar recessions of similar magnitude. In standard models in economics, the speed of firms' adjustment to shocks is presumed to have significant influence on the aggregate rate of employment growth. However, there has been surprisingly little empirical work investigating the determinants of flexibility firms have in responding to shocks. In the wake of the recent recession there have been controversial debates about the power of announcements to stimulate current investment activity and employment: Under which conditions will firms react swiftly to news about the economy? Along which margins are establishments adjusting: do they change prices, employment, investment, or product variety and technology, or do they simply enter or exit altogether? And how important for a speedy adjustment are determinants which are internal to the firm, such as technology or forecasting ability, as opposed to market distortions which are external to firms? This project will produce estimates that characterize dynamic business responses to forecastable shocks and will evaluate whether measures of dynamic adjustment responses forecast exit patterns especially of small employer and non-employer businesses. Based on these new estimates, the researchers will make recommendations about extending the set of variables to include establishment-level adjustment speed to forecasted shocks, which might help to predict current size and the likelihood of transition from a single-establishment to a multi-establishment firm.

1151,Completed,Estimating the Effects of Bankruptcy Regimes on Firm Outcomes,Stanford,2013,2018.0,Shai Bernstein,"This study will identify the differing economic impacts, measured in a variety of ways, between two forms of bankruptcy: the reorganization process of chapter 11 and the liquidation process of chapter 7. Using Census microdata combined with external data, the establishment-level operations of these firms can be observed following the bankruptcy resolution, and the different impacts will be quantified. Typically, research treats the cost of bankruptcy in terms of reduction in the market value of the bankrupt firm. However, when a firm is completely liquidated, it does not end with zero total economic value since its assets (and human capital) are sold to other productive firms and thereby redeployed. This research will quantify the costs of bankruptcy in terms of employment, payroll, and productivity losses, rather than just the dollar value lost to the bankrupt firm and its creditors. This will more accurately depict from where the losses caused by financial distress come, and how large they truly are. Furthermore, relatively little consideration has been given to the question of whether financial distress imposes externalities on other companies. Suppliers, customers, and competitors may be affected when a firm is liquidated or reorganized. This project will examine the behavior of other firms operating in the local economies of bankrupt firms in different bankruptcy regime, in order to quantify the bankruptcy regime differential impact. Although it is very difficult to overcome the selection into the two bankruptcy regimes, the researchers will use heterogeneity across bankruptcy judges as an instrumental variable to estimate the unbiased effect that compares the effects these bankruptcy regimes have on financially distressed firms.",11,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2011,LEHD-ECF-2011,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2011,LEHD-EHF-2011,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2011,LEHD-GAL-2011,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2011,LEHD-ICF-2011,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,Jose Maria Barrero Sanclemente,Shai Bernstein,Emanuele Colonnelli,Xavier A Giroud,Benjamin Iverson,Kristin - Mccue,Ishuwar Seetharam,Ryan Shyu,Jonathan Wallen,T Kirk K White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1157,Completed,The 'Safe Design Project': Addressing Disclosure Risk of Contextualized Microdata in Survey Design,Michigan,2013,2018.0,Kristine M Witkowski,"Demand for contextualized microdata has increased dramatically over the last decade and is expected to increase even more in years to come. The Census Bureau collects data to produce timely population estimates on demographic, social, housing, and economic characteristics for a broad spectrum of geographic areas in the United States and is therefore in a unique position to meet some of this demand. However, releasing geographic details in public-use microdata may increase the risk of disclosure. Current disclosure limitation practices involve suppressing geographic details for spatial units that fail to meet a predefined population threshold (e.g., 100,000). Users interested in studying persons nested within less-populated geographies (e.g., rural counties, tracts, block groups) must access restricted-use data through data enclaves. Neither of these approaches fully satisfies the growing demand for geographically-rich microdata that is being fueled by a variety of researchers, analysts, decision-makers, and administrators. To help alleviate barriers to use, this project will develop methodology that supports the efficient identification of sampling and database designs and associated masking techniques that allow more geographic detail to be released on microdata products, without increased disclosure risk or unnecessary survey costs. This research will use the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) data as the empirical foundation, with the aim of producing statistics that summarize findings from the evaluation of the methodology and broad guidelines derived from disclosure simulations, all of which are to be carefully constructed so as to ensure the confidentiality of the underlying data and disclosure practices.",1,American Community Survey,ACS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Michael R Elliott,Sharan Sharma,Kristine M Witkowski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the researchers will examine the non-response rates on maternal labor force participation and hours worked for low-income mothers by mothers’ characteristics such as education, race, and marital status, and document how this has changed from 1970 to 2000, to evaluate the comparability between different waves of the survey data. This will permit evaluation of whether current weights sufficiently adjust for the non-response patterns for low-income families and potentially identify the sources and the magnitude of this measurement problem. Second, this research will provide aggregate measures for the employment of low-income mothers with young children (e.g., aged 3-8) by education and race, thereby providing measures of the social conditions or well-being of children in low-income families.

Measuring this type of production fragmentation is essential to ensure accurate statistics about current U.S. economic activity and its future growth prospects. This project will combine multiple data sources to provide new measures of production fragmentation, with a particular emphasis on activities that U.S. firms choose to locate in foreign countries. These new measures will address: (1) how fragmentation differs across U.S. firms and geography; (2) the determinants of firms' decisions to fragment production; and (3) the domestic employment and R&D ramifications of firms' fragmentation decisions. To develop new data that measure firms’ global production choices, this project will use items collected in the 2007 Economic Census to identify individual establishments that report fragmenting and offshoring production. To assess firms’ globalization decisions over time, the research will improve the existing linkages currently in the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transaction Database by developing new methodologies to link the trade transactions data to the Longitudinal Business Database, as well as by linking the trade data directly to the economic censuses, the Company Organization Survey, and to the SDC Thomson merger and acquisition data. The new datasets developed under this project will expand the scope and range of the economic activity that can be studied at the plant and firm levels, leading to improved measures of the import, export, and offshoring activity in the U.S. economy.

For instance, have social and economic conditions for Alaska Natives living in a given community changed since 2000? Do current conditions differ from one community or small region to another? During the past several decades, such questions could be answered by using the published Census Bureau statistics derived from the decennial Census long form survey. Unfortunately, the first American Community Survey (ACS) results published in late 2010 for rural Alaska communities exhibit a large downgrade in reliability compared to decennial Census data. Margins of error for many indicators are so high that conditions in one rural Alaska Census Area, let alone community, often cannot be distinguished statistically from those in another. This project meets this critical emerging information need by developing a set of statistically more robust social indicators for rural Alaska communities from the ACS and other sources. It takes advantage of the increased statistical power of the new indicators to test hypotheses about spatial differences and recent change in arctic social conditions that cannot be tested reliably with the published figures.

Moreover, this project will examine uptake of insurance programs and assess causes of disenrollment. To identify low- and moderate-income families in California, quantify earnings volatility, and assess public insurance eligibility, we will use quarterly earnings records contained in the Employment History File from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program linked to household records in the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, and person-level characteristics in the LEHD Individual Characteristics File. To this, we will link Medicaid Statistics Information Systems records, in order to capture spells of enrollment to Medicaid and SCHIP. With this we will generate measures of inappropriate disenrollment (program drop-out despite continuing eligibility) and legitimate disenrollment where return to these programs occurs in a short period of time (churning). In 2014, millions of Americans became eligible for government-subsidized health insurance programs where eligibility is determined by income falling within precisely defined ranges. We find it important to know whether eligible individuals have taken up benefits and, for families with more variable incomes, whether costs of maintaining enrollment results in an increased likelihood of churning—moving off and then back on a program within a short period of time—which is costly both for households and programs.",7,American Community Survey,ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,CMS Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS),CMS_MSIS,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Caroline P Danielson,Daniel S Tan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research hypothesizes that such families have high willingness-to-pay for a short commute (since there is no full-time homemaker) and therefore choose to locate close to work. Since skilled jobs are disproportionately located in city centers, the strive for a short commute results in gentrification of previously poverty stricken but centrally located areas.

Using new segregation measures which address and rectify methodological issues that have limited past research, this research will achieve these goals by demonstrating how it is now possible to study residential segregation at the micro and macro levels and how macro-level segregation is driven by micro-level social processes. In particular, this research will investigate the residential patterns of Latinos using new methodological techniques that will increase understandings of how individual social characteristics relate to residential outcomes for individuals, and how those outcomes in turn can be aggregated to generate measures of segregation at the city level. This project will also address the uncertainty of using the smaller American Community Survey samples for conducting in-depth analyses of residential segregation – analyses that could have once been explored using the data from the (now discontinued) long-form of the decennial census.

To analyze this, the researchers will compare the innovation rates of firms that offshore with those that do not, using China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 as an external shock that generates a quasi-random sample of firms. The key challenge is to ensure that firms who do offshore are not too different from firms that do not offshore in terms of their determinants of innovation, which will require an appropriate comparison group that only Census Bureau microdata can provide. Building upon two previous studies that point to evidence of R&D spillovers to domestic firms from foreign-owned production and the potential knowledge costs from separating production facilities and firm headquarters, this empirical study will attempt to disentangle these opposing effects and quantify the influence of offshoring on different measures of innovation, including R&D expenditures, patenting, and trademarks.

Another set of research questions concerns the connection between the average length of a relationship and bargaining power. For example, do relationships characterized by asymmetric bargaining power become more stable over time? Using transaction-level trade data involving U.S. firms, this research identifies both the buyer and the seller firm for import transactions. This feature makes it possible to determine in the import data whether firms are in an ongoing relationship with each other and to assess their relative bargaining power. Bargaining power is estimated using proxies for firms’ size, the ease with which they can find an alternative trading partner for the same product, and the uniqueness of the product traded.

This project uses confidential Census micro data to test the economic justification for local industrial programs by examining the effect of “winning” the competition for a new large plant on incumbent plant productivity, testing for nonlinearity of the agglomeration function, and testing for evidence of multiple equilibria in county manufacturing shares. The first objective will be accomplished by the use of multiple sets of large plant openings to test spillover estimates for sensitivity to identification strategy. The project will investigate the sensitivity of productivity estimates to changes in the definition of output as well as sensitivity to inclusion of purchased services and to plant sample selection. The researchers will also assess aggregate efficacy by nonparametric estimation of the effect of local plant density on plant output in a partially linear regression model. Finally, the researchers will test whether the “winning” counties’ share of manufacturing and manufacturing industry output is best characterized by a single steady state spatial distribution, whereby counties’ return to their “pre-shock” levels, or multiple equilibria, whereby the shock permanently moves the distribution from its initial steady state to a new one.

1276,Completed,Demand and Supply Factors in Firm Dynamics,UCLA,2016,2019.0,Hugo A Hopenhayn,"It is well established that most entering firms start small and take time to grow. However, less is known about the process of firm growth. This project attempts to understand the determinants of firm growth by identifying demand shocks separately from supply-side factors. Understanding the process of firm growth is important since it has a large effect on the allocation of resources across firms, and hence in the extent of allocative efficiency, which previous research suggests can explain a substantial portion of observed differences in output per worker across countries. The goal of this project is to understand the dynamics of firms by exploring alternative mechanisms of firm growth that do not depend solely on supply-side factors and to assess their quantitative relevance. To assess the contribution of demand side factors to firm growth, this project hopes to identify shocks that make it easier for a firm to sell to customers, relaxing the demand-side constraint to growth. The primary strategy for identifying demand shocks is to exploit variation in “customer access” across time, geographic space, and product lines. For instance, a firm that is exogenously assigned better access to customers should grow faster, if access to customers were a relevant constraint to growth.",8,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Pablo Fajgelbaum,Teresa C Fort,Hugo A Hopenhayn,Eduardo Morales Casado,Dominic Smith,Rongzhang Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have shown that increasing competition from lowering trade barriers enhances efficiency and increases overall TFP growth. Nearly all these studies found that with an increase in competition, large productivity gains can be observed in the data, and that these gains account for a majority of the overall industry gains. However, the underlining mechanism that drives the overall TFP gain is not clear. A primary objective of this research is to examine the effect of increased trade-induced competition pressure and energy costs on technology adoption behavior of establishments.

1310,Completed,Estimating the Determinants of Private School Enrollment: The Role of School Attendance Zone Racial and Ethnic Composition,Cornell,2016,2021.0,Salvatore Saporito,"Public schools are more racially segregated than the school attendance areas to which they supply services. Individual choice for private schools may play a substantial role in contributing to public school segregation, beyond what it would be if all students enrolled in the public school that served their residential area. One of three basic factors likely drives private school enrollment rates. First, children from one racial group, particularly white children, may be more likely to enroll in a private school as shares of non-white students in their school catchment areas increases. Second, members of all racial groups are less likely to enroll in private schools as shares of children in their catchment area who are of their same race increases. A third view is that race is inconsequential in driving private school enrollment. These competing models will be assessed by integrating three data sources: restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year period estimates for 2005-2009, the School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS), which contains geography delineating school catchment areas for thousands of such areas for the 2009-2010 school year, and the Common Core of Data, which describes the characteristics of children who are enrolled in all public schools throughout the United States. Analyses of these three datasets will result in models estimating the probability that a child is enrolled in private school based on their race and the racial composition of the school catchment area in which they live, while holding constant a battery of family, attendance area, and school characteristics.",1,American Community Survey,ACS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Arnab K Basu,Chia-Hua Lin,Melissa P Mcinerney,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question is addressed by two approaches: a standard statistical model incorporating non-confidential macroeconomic time series (mostly) from government agencies, and an economic model explaining how uncertainty shocks impact both “constrained” and “unconstrained” firms. The economic model uses a time series measure of “micro-uncertainty” based on the cross-sectional dispersion of residuals for firm-level revenue functions in the QFR microdata. For each of the “completed” 1977-2011 panel datasets, where missing values are filled in with the simulated values from one of the imputations, firm-level financial fields such as net sales are aggregated by year, quarter and “unconstrained”/”constrained” firm status. The aggregated financial data are merged with non-confidential macroeconomic time series data by year and quarter, and the merged datasets are used to estimate a system of dynamic regression equations to statistically test whether economic shocks have different effects on “constrained” and “unconstrained” firms",1,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Kaiji Chen,Anne Hannusch,Patrick Higgins,Tong Xu,Tao Zha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1326,Completed,Alternative Approaches to the Analysis of Complex Sample Survey Data: Applying State-of-the-Art Methods to NCSES Surveys,Michigan,2016,2019.0,Joseph W Sakshaug,"Secondary analyses of survey data sets collected from large probability samples of persons or establishments further scientific progress in many academic fields. The samples underlying these data sets, while enabling inferences about population characteristics or relationships between variables of interest in populations of interest, are often ""complex"" in nature, employing sampling strategies such as stratification of the population and cluster sampling. These complex sample design features improve data collection efficiency, but also complicate secondary analyses in terms of the approaches that need to be employed to account for the complex sampling statistically. Unfortunately, many secondary analysts of these data sets do not have formal training in survey statistics, and ultimately apply incorrect analytic methods when analyzing these data sets, which can lead to incorrect population inferences. This research project reviews published studies of National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) data sets to understand the statistical approaches that users of these data are currently employing, reviews the existing literature in survey statistics with regard to alternative design-based and model-based approaches that are appropriate for complex samples, and then applies these alternative approaches to several NCSES data sets, comparing the resulting inferences for a variety of statistical problems and educating data users about appropriate analytic methods.",2,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,National Survey of College Graduates,NSCG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Brady T West,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With few exceptions the extant literature on locational attainment has not considered temporal trends nor how housing assistance might facilitate or retard access to different types of neighborhoods. For poorer individuals, housing assistance is likely to be an important determinant of the type of neighborhood they are able to reside in. Housing assistance allows the recipients to live in housing they could otherwise not afford. Conversely, project based housing assistance and especially public housing has a long history of confining its clientele to the poorest and least desirable neighborhoods. This project uses decades of restricted-use American Housing Survey (AHS) data, which allows for ideal neighborhood definitions at the census tract level.

1354,Completed,Organizational Capital and Firm Value,Maryland,2015,2022.0,Liu A Yang,"This project studies the role of organizational capital using data from the newly available Management and Organization Practices Survey (MOPS). It examines the investment and distribution of organizational capital across firms and industries, how these investments interact with investments in physical capital, and ultimately how they are related to firm value and risk. The first set of questions is to understand how firms invest in organizational capital. How do managerial practices form and evolve over time in a firm? Do firms have similar practices in different units across industries and capital vintage? How does organizational capital interact with investments in physical capital? Do managerial practices and organizational structure influence financial decisions such as leverage and cash holdings? None of these questions have yet been thoroughly explored, and most of the existing evidence on managerial and organizational practices are anecdotal and difficult to compare across firms. The unique features of MOPS allow for addressing these questions. The second question is how organizational capital is related to firm risk. Part of the productive knowledge in the firm is accumulated in its employees, particularly managers and key talents. The organizational capital that is embedded in key employees (i.e., firm-specific human capital) is portable. The ultimate question is how organizational capital is related to firm value. Other research shows that good managerial practices correlate positively with firm productivity. However, identifying a causal effect of managerial practices on firm value can be very challenging. The problem will be addressed through two important corporate events – takeovers/acquisitions and shareholder activism.",9,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,POP_TABLES,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Vojislav Maksimovic,Yue Wang,Jing Xue,Liu A Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1356,Active,"Access to Financing and Its impact on Growth, Innovation, and Performance",Boston,2020,,Karthik Krishnan,"The project will explore how access to various sources of financing can affect entrepreneurial start up activity. We will also analyze the relationship between access to financing and start up firm performance, productivity, employment growth, and sales, and the extent to which these performance measures relate to successful exit outcomes for private firms through acquisitions and IPOs. Further, prior literature has indicated that innovative startups are the ones that foster the greatest growth in employment and productivity. We will thus also analyze the relationship between access to financing and startup innovative activity. Since greater availability of financing will enhance opportunities for entrepreneurs to invest in their projects, we expect a positive relationship between access to financing and these outcome variables. We will also try to understand the differential effect of the various types of financing options available to startup firms and their impact on the above outcome variables. Moreover, we will test whether these different sources of funding are substitutes or complements (i.e., getting one type of financing allows a firm to obtain another type of financing later on). For instance, venture capitalists screen the investments through a detailed due-diligence process (e.g., Chemmanur, Krishnan, and Nandy (2011)). They may thus choose firms that are successful in obtaining seed financing from angels, which may potentially serve as another screening mechanism. Broadly, we expect to analyze the impact from three different sources of financing:  debt (e.g., bank loans); equity or stakeholder funded (e.g., angel, venture capital, and crowdfunding); and government awards (e.g., SBIR). 

The project will further investigate the extent to which non-employer businesses transition to employer firms, and if an exogenous shift in financing has an enhanced effect on these transitions. Further, an important milestone in the life of an entrepreneurial venture is the entrepreneur's choice of exit and the particular channel of exit, i.e. IPO or acquisition of the entrepreneurial firm. This is important from various perspectives. First, the evolution and the eventual success of a firm will require the ability to raise larger amounts of capital, potentially from public markets. Second, early stage investors such as angel financiers and venture capitalists typically provide capital and support to entrepreneurial ventures with the explicit or implicit understanding that they will exit the investment at a certain stage. Moreover, becoming a public firm or selling off one's venture is considered by many to be the final goal of entrepreneurship. Thus, at least from a financial perspective, in both the early and the later stages of a firm's life, the exit strategy is important. We will analyze if there are significant interactions between the exit strategy of firms and the extent and type of financing of the entrepreneurial firm. A related issue for an entrepreneurial firm is how to keep financing itself as it grows and how to choose between various debt and equity financing sources (which would shape the capital structure of the entrepreneurial firm).",21,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Yupeng Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1381,Completed,Accounting for Productivity Dispersion over the Business Cycle,Fed Board,2017,2022.0,Robert J Kurtzman,"In this research, we present accounting decompositions of changes in aggregate labor and capital productivity. Such decompositions are a useful tool for researchers looking to assess the role of distortions to the distribution of labor or capital across firms in driving the dynamics of productivity and other aggregates over the business cycle. These decompositions can be used to test whether firm-level behavior in models with frictions is consistent with firm-level behavior in data, or to help guide model selection. Our simplest decomposition breaks changes in an aggregate factor productivity ratio into two components: a mean component, which captures common changes to firm factor productivity ratios, and a dispersion component, which captures changes in the higher order moments of the distribution of firm factor productivity ratios. We demonstrate analytically, in a model of frictions to firm labor and capital choices, that the dispersion component reflects changes in the extent of distortions to firm factor input allocations across firms.

1392,Completed,Improving the quality of the National Crime Victimization Survey and Police Public Contact Survey in order to better understand the determinates of help-seeking behavior among victims of intimate-partner and sexual assaults,Texas,2016,2019.0,Megan Bears Augustyn,"There is a rich literature examining the factors associated with help-seeking behaviors among victims of crime. However, the ability to draw conclusions from this body of research is hampered by small, highly selective (biased)  samples of victims and/or a limited focus on incident and individual-level factors. One implication is a dearth of information on the general and specific effects of socio-cultural factors that likely influence reporting behaviors among victims of violent crimes. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) contains a nationally representative sample of persons ages 12 and over and has the potential to overcome prior limitations by examining whether victims of intimate partner and sexual violence engage in two types of formal help-seeking behavior: reporting and accessing victim services. In addition to detailed information on incident and victim characteristics, the NCVS also contains geographic identifiers that enable a researcher to link incident-level and individual-level information with contextual factors such as proactive justice policies, resource availability, and community attitudes, in order to estimate how socio-cultural factors influence the help seeking pathways of victims of intimate partner and sexual assault.",2,National Crime Victimization Survey,NCVS,Police-Public Contact Survey,NCVSPPCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Megan Bears Augustyn,Katherine Calle Willyard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research relates to a growing body of work assessing whether significant aggregate fluctuations may originate from microeconomic shocks. While earlier work has focused on the linkages across sectors, with mixed results, the objective here is to estimate linkages within networks of firms. The Commodity Flow Survey, which is the main source of supply chain information produced by the Census Bureau, will be merged and compared with two publicly available sources of information on supply chain relationships: Compustat and the Federal Procurement Data System. A variety of sources of shocks will be considered, including natural disasters, power outages, trade shocks, government spending shocks, and credit-supply shocks. This project also builds on earlier work that considers the importance of switching costs for the propagation of firm-level shocks.

This research builds off a preliminary exercise with public-use data from the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to model and forecast income inequality. Extending that analysis with the use of restricted-access CPS data will improve earlier income inequality measures. Internally topcoded data will enable the researcher to accurately model the income distribution and provide better forecasts, as the majority of the changes in income inequality have occurred in the top income percentiles, i.e., precisely those data which are topcoded. This research also examines how the income distribution changes over the course of the year. The researcher will compare results obtained from the CPS March supplement to the rolling data available from the American Community Survey, administered monthly. Given the timing of the CPS survey (shortly before the tax filing deadline) and the number of questions on various income sources for the past calendar year, estimates obtained using the CPS are judged to most accurately represent the true income distribution of the United States.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Marina Gindelsky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This question is of particular interest since capacity addition and withdrawal decisions are important strategic decisions that can have a significant impact on price and profitability in the short run. Moreover, given that investment is long-lived, it is a critical determinant of how the competitive environment evolves in the long-run. Although the empirical literature in industrial organization has widely explored the connection between market structure and the competitiveness of market outcomes, the literature connecting labor and capital adjustment costs and market competition is scarce.

These policies are relatively new and vary from city to city, so not much is known about their full effects. To evaluate different congestion reduction policies, this project will develop a discrete choice structural model of the joint decision of individual residence and commuting mode, given the characteristics of the housing market and commuting options. The model is estimated for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area using individual-level, restricted-access data from the 1996-2013 American Community Surveys (ACS), which includes information on where individuals live and work, together with data on the structure of the transportation network, to map each individual’s optimal commute for each option in the individual's choice set. The mappings will create a dataset of commute options and characteristics that will be used to estimate the trade-offs that individuals make among consumption, housing amenities, and leisure when choosing a home and commuting mode pair. The model estimates will be used to simulate the effects of transportation policies that alter the financial and time costs of commuting. These policies include congestion pricing schemes, fuel or carbon taxes, and increased parking fees.",1,American Community Survey,ACS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Christopher M Clapp,Zichong Qu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1481,Active,"Location Spillovers, Labor Market Outcomes and Firm Productivity",Boston,2022,,Stephen L Ross,"The goal of this project is to examine the underlying social determinants of agglomeration economies.  Specifically, we will use samples of workers drawn from the ACS and Decennial Census data to examine the effect of proximity to employment concentrations and firm activity more generally on wages, and use samples drawn from the Longitudinal Business Database and related data sets to estimate models of Total Factor Productivity (manufacturing only), employment growth and establishment formation as a function of surrounding economic activity.  Economic spillovers, one of Marshall's three major agglomerative forces, are thought to arise from social interactions between individuals when information and ideas are exchanged.  However, large amounts of evidence exist to suggest that the pattern of social interactions is not random, with individuals that share key human capital or demographic attributes often choosing to interact with each other more than with similarly situated individuals who differ on those attributes.  Therefore, we intend to examine the extent to which wages and establishment outcomes vary with the match between a firm's workers and the surrounding workforce.  When available, we intend to use existing matches between sampled workers in the ACS and Decennial Census with establishments in order to provide better controls for the match between each firm's workers and the attributes of surrounding workers.

1485,Active,"Democracy, Institutions, Firms and Trade",Boston,2016,,Kishore Gawande,"This research seeks a deeper understanding of (1) how political institutions in partner countries (for example, democracy, autocracy, anocracy) affect the international competitiveness of U.S. firms, (2) which products that U.S. firms export and import are especially sensitive to political institutions in partner countries, and (3) whether institutions in partner countries influence the decision by U.S. firms to expand on the extensive margin (i.e., to enter new markets). These questions underlie the nature of trade between countries and how that has evolved in the past and how it may be expected to evolve in the future. The first research question seeks an explanation of how the exports and imports of U.S. firms adapt to real-world institutions in their partner countries. The second research question takes this inquiry to the product level and asks whether partner-country institutions enhance or obstruct the competitiveness of specific products that U.S. firms export. The third research question remains unexplored at present, but the growing importance of global supply chains makes this imperative.

1497,Completed,The Effects of Labor Mobility on Firm Capital Structure,Austin,2016,2019.0,Avishai Schiff,"This research explores the effects of labor mobility on firms’ financial decisions. More mobile workers are better insured against involuntary separation risk wrought by higher leverage and thus can accommodate higher debt levels. However, unlike physical capital, a firm does not own its employees’ human capital. Thus, when a firm exhibits poor performance, mobile workers are more likely to voluntarily leave than to accept lower wages. This voluntary separation risk induces a higher degree of operational leverage (fixed cost of operation) which may then crowd out financial leverage and lead to lower debt levels at firms with more mobile labor forces. The goal of this study is to use local labor market conditions and regulatory shocks to employees’ abilities to switch firms to disentangle and separately measure these two opposite effects.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Jonathan Cohn,Avishai Schiff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1499,Active,"Understanding the growth dynamics of firms and regions: Clusters, entrepreneurial quality, and regional prosperity over the business cycle",Boston,2017,,Mercedes N Delgado,"This project examines the resilience of regions and firms in the context of the recent Great Recession and prior economic recessions. When faced with a negative economic shock, the presence of clusters – geographic concentrations of related industries, firms, and supporting institutions – in a region could mitigate the effects of the negative shock. Agglomeration economies arise in regional clusters of related economic activity, and the interconnection of industries (and associated firms) could facilitate a faster recovery from a recession. Using data from the U.S. Cluster Mapping Project (USCMP) and the Longitudinal Business Database, this projects examines whether industries in strong clusters experience faster growth (as measured by employment, wage, entrepreneurship, innovation or productivity) before, during, and/or after the recession period than industries located in weak clusters. A related aspect of regional (and firm) resilience is the ability of a region or firm to diversify and re-invent itself. This project examines the role of related economic diversifications on the recovery of regions and firms. Further, the distribution of economic success within regions is often uneven, and pockets of concentrated poverty and high unemployment rates persist in American cities. Using data from the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, the USCMP, and the Census Bureau, this projects explores whether clusters matter for the performance of inner cities, investigating if integrating inner cities into the cluster composition of their regions would lead to more effective employment outcomes.",29,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Kauffman Firm Survey,KFS,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,"Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders",M3,National Employer Survey,NES,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Mercedes N Delgado,Jorge A Guzman,Jisoo Kim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploiting a seven-year $800 million subsidy lottery in California's film industry that sorted hundreds of establishments across cities of varying industrial concentration in film, the project studies how production incentives affect establishment location decisions and their associated impact on local wages, employment, municipal revenue, and productivity. Placing these estimates of subsidy benefits in a spatial equilibrium framework, the second part of this study examines the cost-side of attracting employers with local incentives by characterizing the welfare effects of fiscal competition between municipalities. Finally, the project leverages a policy change in 2014 that reformed the subsidy allocation mechanism from a lottery system to a ""jobs-impact"" ranking formula, providing an ideal laboratory for examining whether subsidy lotteries generate misallocation costs, compared to deliberate employment-based allocation mechanisms.",9,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Services,CSR,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Matthew L Freedman,Ben Hyman,Shantanu Khanna,Karen X Ni,Christopher J Simard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work augments and develops preliminary work suggesting a link between hurricanes in Central America and the Caribbean and subsequent migration inflows to the U.S. from those regions. Establishing such a relationship requires reliable, year-by-year estimates of migration flows from foreign countries into the United States.

However, the rate of participation in these programs, as well as the individual characteristics associated with participation, is not well understood. This is in part because household surveys administered by the Census Bureau and other entities do not collect information on MSP participation, and administrative sources that identify MSP enrollment clearly exclude those eligible but not enrolled. This research attempts to fill this gap in data collection by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked with administrative data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

1515,Completed,Why do variety-adjusted price indices vary substantially across locations?,Baruch,2016,2024.0,David Weinstein,"This project investigates competing explanations provided by the economic geography literature on why variety-adjusted price indices vary substantially across locations. In the presence of trade costs, more producers locate in larger cities, which implies that larger cities produce more consumer products and have lower price indices. As more productive firms are located in larger cities and more producers locate in larger cities, larger cities are characterized by lower price as firms charge lower markup. Moreover, these theories only consider the way heterogeneity in manufacturing firms’ productivity across locations drives the number of products available to consumers, abstracting from the role of non-manufacturing industries and the growing share of imported goods relative to the ones sourced domestically. Measurement of the productivity growth in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing services sectors is difficult because it is hard to measure the prices of outputs that firms sell, the prices of inputs they use, and identify whether the products sold are sourced domestically or are imported from abroad. Moreover, there has been no research investigating the link between the heterogeneity in non-manufacturing firms’ productivity across locations and the number of domestically sourced or imported products available. This is mainly because it has been difficult to obtain data on the prices of products sold by a given retailer in a given U.S. location and the number of products imported, and sold at a given U.S. location. Therefore, this project aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a unified framework in which the previously mentioned explanations can be separated and quantified by using restricted Census microdata.",11,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8.0,Patrick W Farrell,Mark Greenan,Ildiko Magyari,Scott X Marchi,Stephen Redding,Dyanne A Vaught,David Weinstein,Yingjie Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An earlier literature documented strong evidence of regional convergence of incomes per capita throughout the United States up until the 1980s. That is, workers in poorer states were catching up to workers in the richer states, just as simple neoclassical growth models would predict. But, over the past 30 years, regional convergence amongst the U.S. states has dramatically diminished, presenting a puzzle for macroeconomists. Structural transformation, defined as both employment shifts between sectors and as the transformation of the production technology of any given sector may be a major cause of this convergence slow-down. This project estimates speeds of convergence for different sectors at new, more precise levels of geographic and industrial disaggregation as well as estimates the potential determinants of convergence speed, such as education, capital-intensity, technology, trade exposure, legal organization, R&D, and so on. These new empirical results will reveal whether and how different kinds of structural transformation might slow down the convergence process.",13,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Benjamin Austin,Gabriel Unger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1551,Completed,Labor Force Restructuring and Merger and Acquisition Gains,Missouri,2017,2022.0,Kateryna Holland,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are key investment and restructuring activities through which an economy reallocates resources across industries and over time, generating enormous wealth for investors and society as a whole. Despite decades of research, however, the question of where do the gains from mergers come from is still largely open. In fact, while academics and practitioners concur that a major source of gains is synergies, particularly cost savings, a precise quantification of these remains elusive. The primary objective of this project is to estimate the size of cost savings associated with employment restructuring in M&A. To do so, this research proposes a novel methodology of estimating the present value of cash flows from employment restructuring in M&A (“cost synergies”). This methodology carefully accounts for wage changes for employees present in the acquiring and target firms prior to and post M&A, and for wage changes associated with M&A-related layoffs, plant sales, and plant closures.

What establishment characteristics predict high-skill demands and/or skill-related hiring difficulties? Although the issue of skills receives considerable attention in debates related to economic growth, unemployment, and income inequality, the existing literature rarely measures skills directly, instead relying on rough proxies for skill. Even in cases where more precise measures of skill are available, these measures are rarely linked to firm- or establishment-level data. We seek to address these limitations by linking manufacturing datasets from the Census Bureau with an external data that contains detailed measurements of manufacturing establishment-level skill demands.

1571,Active,Productivity and Wage Dispersion in the Great Recession and Beyond,Boston,2019,,William R Kerr,"This project will investigate the extent of labor hoarding versus productivity change by establishments and firms during the Great Recession, and differences in responses compared to prior recessions and across sectors. The first part analyses the response of firms and establishments to the changes in total industry demand during the Great Recession and subsequent recovery. We will also contrast job loss and closure between firms that invest heavily in intangible capital, such as R&D, and those that invest less. Our analysis of the Census data prior to the GR showed a huge widening of the distribution of average wages of firms and of establishments in the same firm. We will assess whether there is greater heterogeneity in employment responses among firms and establishments within firms than in the past, and the characteristics of the observed heterogeneity. A novel feature is that we will add measures of occupational status and human capital to the establishments. Using measures of sales, capital input, employment, material inputs and wages we plan to look more carefully into the productivity dispersion, employment and wage dispersion across establishments in general. First we want to establish and analyze the rent sharing behavior of firms. We will develop this literature further, providing estimates of rent sharing for different types of employees, both in terms of occupation, gender and in terms of educational level.

The existence of a wide distribution of wages across establishments, even for the same worker, raises questions of the performance of the labor market, and why market forces do not work to eliminate these wage differentials. The behavior of employers thus seems to indicate that there are large frictions in labor markets. One way of studying such frictions is to study job-to-job transitions. We plan to study the relationship between the wage distribution across establishments and job-to-job transitions over time and between different types of workers. Furthermore, worker flows across firms and establishments create direct connections between various organizational units. These connections provide possible avenues for information flows and spillovers between firms. We will study the interconnectedness between firms and establishments as means of both knowledge transfer and as instruments for measuring the competitiveness of the economy.

Using the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database to identify firms and establishments in the U.S. importing or exporting goods from foreign subsidiaries, we estimate the effects of off- and reshoring of plants on plant- and worker-level outcomes, such as productivity and wages. In addition, we use the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey to estimate the effect of changes in firm or establishment location on capital expenditures. Finally, we estimate the role of unions in shaping the sensitivity of wages to productivity and analyze how changes in industry market concentration affect the worker-level outcomes such as wages.

We examine how financial conditions impact employment and the dynamics of firms over the business cycle. We link bank financial statement/balance sheet data to Census Bureau establishment and firm data to study how the financial crisis of 2008 affected banks’ supply of funds for lending and by extension, firms’ employment outcomes and ability to take out loans. For each employer establishment in the Longitudinal Business Database, we construct a measure to represent the financial constraints facing the firm in their geographic area. This measure is calculated using outside data about the balance sheet conditions of banks, weighted by the relative market share that each bank has in a given establishment’s local area. The hypothesis is that employment will suffer at small/young firms when the financial conditions of local banks deteriorate, because these types of firms are heavily reliant on commercial bank financing. If so, this could explain why entrepreneurial businesses suffered disproportionately during the financial crisis. Besides employment, we will also explore how the financial constraint variable affects other outcomes such as entry and exit rates, productivity, wages, volatility, inventories, and characteristics of new business owners.

Confidential Census data is necessary to examine the lotteries because H-1B visas were randomly awarded to individuals with employment agreements with U.S. firms. Because firms span geographical boundaries, the effects that occur within firms may dissipate when analyzing more aggregate units of observation.

1594,Active,The Causes and Consequences of Automation,Berkeley,2021,,Sydnee Caldwell,"In the past three decades, the number of robots has increased by more than 400 percent in both Europe and the US (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017) . Automation has rapidly become one of the most debated political and economic issues in many countries. But why do firms decide to automate and what are the consequences of these decisions for workers and local communities?

This project will add to our understanding of the causes and consequences of automation by constructing firm-level measures of automation, which we will use to isolate the effects of automation on workers' employment trajectories and on their political behavior. We will leverage the fact that, because most industrial robots are imported from abroad, we can observe firms' purchases of robots in product-level trade data. 

The first part of our analysis will look at why firms decided to automate, focusing on two potential channels: (1) changes in the cost of labor, and (2) changes in the composition of the labor force. We will then analyze its impact on workers' employment and earnings trajectories, by comparing workers in firms that choose to automate with a matched sample of control workers. The final part of the project will link these effects to political outcomes. Are communities (or groups of individuals) that are more affected by automation more likely to start supporting policies that would shield them against labor market competition (including from robots)?  Are they more politically engaged?  We will answer these questions by comparing the evolution of vote shares and turnout in Congressional and Presidential elections in areas that were more or less exposed to automation.",19,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,American Community Survey,ACS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Sydnee Caldwell,Frank T Gaunt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1616,Active,The Consequences of Firm-Level Wage Compression,Chicago,2017,,Christina Patterson,"Using the LEHD and ACS data, this project explores firm-level wage compression, a practice in which lower productivity workers are paid more while higher productivity workers are paid less. This research will document how prevalent wage compression is in the U.S. economy, as well as the relationship between wage compression and the cyclical properties of nominal wages and the recent trends in earnings inequality. For example, wage compression within the firm may be related to the cyclical properties of the labor market if firms with more wage compression are more attune to fairness concerns and, therefore, are less likely to drop their wages in response to negative economic shocks. Furthermore, if there are differences in wage compression across firms, high ability workers will likely want to sort into the firms with less wage compression, and lower ability individuals will want to sort into higher wage compression firms where they are paid more. These incentives will lead to an increase in the sorting of workers across firms over time. Additionally, it may be that firms share their profits with workers, and that, because of fairness concerns, the firm shares the economic profits with all of its workers. Wage compression within the firm, therefore, affects how much differences in profits across firms can explain the rise in between-firm wage variability, even for people at the bottom of the skill distribution.",8,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2011,LEHD-ECF-2011,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2011,LEHD-EHF-2011,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2011,LEHD-ICF-2011,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2011,LEHD-U2W-2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Colin T Gray,Christina Patterson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While increased domestic energy production has important strategic implications for the country as a whole, the most profound impacts may be on the small towns and rural areas where the energy extraction is occurring. Much work has been done to estimate the economic and environmental impacts of shale energy development, yet little empirical work has assessed its impact on family outcomes and community demographic composition. We use restricted access American Community Survey microdata from 2006–2014 to estimated difference-in-differences models of shale energy development on family processes. Family outcomes of interest include fertility (marital and nonmarital), marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and migration. We do not expect shale development to have progressed long enough to have a measurable impact on overall fertility rates. However, nonmarital fertility is more closely associated with short-term individual level economic, so we expect shale development to significantly impact nonmarital fertility.

For example, economic disasters such as recessions are infrequent, affect everyone, and are costly to the economy. There have only been five since the 1970s, but they have been widely studied and documented to be highly damaging. In contrast, natural disasters are more frequent in occurrence, local to certain geographies, and exhibit large variation in the extent of damage. While the economy-wide impact of natural disasters has also been studied, there exists limited plant- and firm-level evidence on the consequences of such frequent, unpredictable disasters; on the extent to which their impact differs from the repercussions of economic disasters; and the various characteristics that may determine the capacity to respond and adapt to uncertain and disruptive events.

It has been a challenge to link labor turnover to firm performance because the benefits and costs of labor turnover are hard to quantify. Besides, firm performance is very hard to measure in general because it is affected both by financial factors outside firms and operational efficiencies inside firms. This research empirically determines the sign and magnitude of the correlation between labor turnover and firm operational performance. First, the project examines inventory turnover, a financial and operational metric indicating how fast a retailer is generating value compared to its average inventory level. By controlling for its correlation with related financial metrics, adjusted inventory turnover (AIT) is estimated to measure firm operational performance. AIT has been shown to predict future financial performance, including sales, earnings, and stock return. Second, this relationship varies across retailers of different labor intensity. By controlling for retailer characteristics, the correlation of labor turnover and firm performance is estimated, and the exacerbating or mitigating effect of labor intensity is investigated. Moreover, this research tests the hypothesis that such a relation is non-linear.

1667,Completed,"Production, Energy Use, and Employment Decisions in Response to Changes in Energy Production, Environmental Factors, and the Business Environment",Triangle,2018,2023.0,Earnest Curtis,"Significant heterogeneity exists in energy markets and the business environment across the United States. States and regions have adopted different strategies to address both the challenges of supplying electricity and the negative externalities associated with its production (e.g., emissions, pollutants). Variation in strategies leads to divergent energy market choices that differentially impact important economic outcomes. Theory suggests that plants facing variation in electricity prices should respond by adjusting output and employment, but it may be difficult to estimate the impact of electricity prices because they are often negotiated. Recent research finds that larger or better managed firms generally receive better prices than smaller or more poorly managed firms. We will use Census Bureau manufacturing and energy consumption data, together with matched employee-employer data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, to assess the effects of energy market variation in relation to the following questions. How do plants adjust output and employment in response to changes in the business environment, changes in energy prices, and environmental shocks? Which types of workers are impacted by these adjustments, and do firms shift employment and output from plants located in regions that receive negative environmental or price shocks to plants located in regions that did not receive the shock? What firm and plant characteristics correlate with plant outcomes such as energy intensity and pollution intensity? What adjustments do plants and firms make in response to shocks (e.g., changes in the business environment, changes in energy prices, environmental shocks)?

1668,Active,The Impact of Accounting Frauds on Labor Markets,Stanford,2017,,Jung Ho Choi,"Prior studies have investigated the effect of accounting fraud on various parties, including investors, top managers, consumers, and peer firms. However, the impact of accounting fraud on labor markets has received little attention, likely because of data limitations. The question this study addresses is whether the labor market outcomes of employees of accounting fraud firms could have been different if those firms had not been involved in accounting fraud. Using data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, Longitudinal Business Database, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Census of Manufactures, we examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. These data sets allow us to track employee information, such as wages and job switches, over time. To analyze the employment effects, we combine Census Bureau data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting. We find that, compared to a matched sample, employee wages decline during and after fraud, and that employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative after. During fraud, managers overinvest in labor. Frauds cause informational opacity, and fraudulent reports tend to indicate good prospects, encouraging employees to still join the firm. After the fraud is revealed and the overemployment is unwound, employee wages fall due to turnover, with related job-search challenges and losses of firm-specific investments, and the stigma associated with the fraud. We use various subsamples to provide evidence for these mechanisms, showing that labor market disruptions and stigma have meaningful and negative consequences for employees.",18,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Business Register Bridge (BRB) - 2008,LEHD-BRB-2008,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-GALT26-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,Jung Ho Choi,Brandon L Gipper,Mitchell Linegar,Sara Malik,Caitlin A McCarthy,Austin Pennington,Fiona L Sequeira,Xuan Su,Sorabh Tomar,Bao Khanh H Vu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research is motivated by the burgeoning recent literature documenting that the rise in import competition from China and other low wage countries in the early 2000s has exerted important negative effects on employment, while simultaneously leading to increased technical change within firms and reallocation of employment towards more productive firms. This project addresses a set of important questions that have so far been left unexplored: What are the effects of increased trade exposure on startup rates and the post-entry dynamics of firms in terms of survival and employment growth? What is the role of offshoring in explaining these employment effects? How do firms react to increased trade exposure in terms of capital intensity, technical change, organization, and management practices? To what extent can increased trade exposure, through its impact on firm dynamics, account for the slowdown in aggregate employment and productivity growth observed in U.S. data?

1673,Completed,"Searching, matching, and the transfer of information in international trade relationships",Atlanta,2017,2021.0,Seung Hoon Lee,"This study examines the establishment and evolution of firms’ international trading relationships at the transaction level using a novel “two-sided” firm trade transactions dataset which, for the period 1992 through 2011, links U.S. importers from the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database to exporters from Korean firm-level data provided by a Korean credit agency. This research exploits the unique ownership structure of Korean firms, the majority of which operate under the control of a business group. Specifically, this study tests for evidence of export spillovers for firms within the same ownership structure and estimates the degree of information transfer. The researchers hypothesize that firms with more information about a foreign market face lower costs in building new trade relationships abroad. Thus, with the transfer of information and market-specific knowledge, firms should benefit from being in business groups where member companies have more trade relationships. Furthermore, this impact may be even stronger if a Korean company has a foreign affiliate in the United States. The project also examines whether the sharing of information was helpful during the recent global financial crisis in avoiding the loss of exports at the intensive margin and the loss of trading relationships at the extensive margin.",4,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Seung Hoon Lee,Tongyang Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternatively, if firm pay premiums reflect productivity differences, and workers are paid more at productive firms due to potential rent sharing, then a target firm that is acquired by a firm with higher wage premiums should experience an increase in wages.

This project poses three questions. First, what are the predominant mechanisms through which trade shocks impact aggregate employment and output? Alongside direct effects, we evaluate two leading explanations for trade-induced job losses: aggregate demand effects and propagation through input-output linkages. Second, how do trade shocks affect the allocation of economic activity across firms? Theoretical models of firm-level dynamics suggest that the effects of both direct and indirect import exposure on entry, exit, and factor demands should vary systematically with a firm’s initial productivity, exporting status, size, and age. These heterogeneous treatment effects, if present, could give rise to economically important reallocation in response to trade shocks.

By estimating the cross-industry local multiplier effects, this research also helps in understanding the nature of local production agglomeration. In addition, by estimating the effect of labor demand shocks on entries of local service firms and rents, the research also sheds light on the mechanism of local consumption agglomeration.

Despite some declines over the last forty years, in 2010, almost two-thirds of black households and half of Hispanic households would have had to move to achieve complete integration with the white population. Income segregation, on the other hand, has increased over time and has accelerated over the last decade. The endurance of residential segregation is particularly interesting given the high rates of residential mobility among American households. In fact, half of all households in the U.S. change residences over a five-year period. The scope, scale, and predictors of the geographic mobility of households have evolved over time and have varied across metropolitan areas. Much less is known, however, about how households choose where to move. This project will use discrete choice models that frame geographic mobility as a multidimensional process where the decision to move is modelled using an extensive set of neighborhood characteristics. The estimates will show the probability of moving to a neighborhood given the socioeconomic characteristics of a household and given the socioeconomic characteristics of potential neighborhood destinations within a metropolitan area. The discrete choice models will be used to simulate the conditions of residential mobility that can achieve lower levels of residential segregation. This research may generate important insights into how changing geographic mobility across racial and income groups can also change aggregate segregation levels by race and income.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Yana A Kucheva,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1719,Active,Civil service reforms - evidence from US municipalities,Boston,2017,,Arianna Ornaghi,"This research examines the effects of civil service reforms on municipal bureaucracies and their performance. Historically, public administration in the United States was characterized by a spoils system in which elected politicians had the power to hire and fire bureaucrats. Provisions aimed at professionalizing the bureaucracy were first introduced at the federal level and slowly diffused to lower levels of government. These reforms were characterized by both meritocratic hiring and political protections for public employees. These reforms may select in better workers through competitive entrance requirements but reduce performance incentives through tenure. This projects examines those states that mandated cities to institute civil service boards for police and fire departments based on population thresholds. This research exploits these thresholds in a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of introducing the merit system. First, using data from the decennial censuses of 1960 to 2000, this projects looks at the effect on the demographic composition of police and fire departments and, in particular, the gender, age, and racial composition of these department, together with the educational level of policemen and firemen. Second, this research studies whether the reforms had effects on the performance of these departments, including crime rates.

Considerable work has been devoted to investigating why, whether, and when people decide to marry, have children, and change residences, whether particular programs or factors influence these decisions, and how these choices in turn affect other life decisions. This project considers determinants of these outcomes and evaluates the data used in such analyses. To these ends, this project considers the extent to which empirical analyses using the American Community Survey (ACS) marital history and marital status questions yield comparable or divergent results. The researcher considers determinants of marriage decisions, on their own and in conjunction with fertility and migration decisions, and examine the role of various legal changes and natural experiments occurring between 2008 and 2015. The project will also assess the benefit of the ACS marital history questions, which have been considered for removal in recent years and may again be considered for removal or revision in the future.

In order to do so, this project implements a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that relies on exact date of birth relative to school entry cutoff dates. Data from the long form of the 2000 Decennial Census and the ACS (2002-2014) contain respondents’ exact date of birth, which allows the researchers to estimate whether individuals born just before the applicable school entry cutoff date in their state of residence are, on average, slightly more educated than those born just after the cutoff. This research will rely on voter registration and turnout data for all fifty states and the District of Columbia to estimate whether individuals born just before the cutoff date are more likely to vote; and by relating population estimates based on the 2010 Decennial Census to counts of registered voters in the user-supplied data, estimate whether there exists a discontinuity in the propensity to register to vote in the first place. Finding a discontinuity around school entry cutoff dates in educational attainment as well as voter turnout and/or registration would be evidence that education exerts a causal effect on civic participation.

State and federal laws regulate the disclosure of information concerning lead presence in homes built prior to 1978, as well as abatement. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, professional lead-based paint removal costs between $8 to $15 per square foot, with the average removal project costing about $10,000. This project assesses how the costs imposed by the regulations affect housing prices and home-ownership, while quantifying the health benefits of the regulation. Indeed, the adverse effects of lead-based paint on children's health are likely to be mediated by households' responses to the information regarding lead hazards.

I am interested in examining two questions. The first will study the extent to which changes in the work requirement for SNAP eligibility affects the demand for services provided by non-government providers. In other words, does access to SNAP crowd-out the private provision of public goods? The work requirement affects the population of able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD), who must work at least 20 hours a week or participate in state-sponsored job training in order to receive benefits. If these requirements are not met, they are only eligible to receive benefits for 3 months in a 36-month period. Additionally, I am interested in exploring how this relation varies across an individual’s access to supermarkets and local food pantries. 
Second, I will explore is whether a negative shock to charitable giving affected the local use of public assistance (i.e.. SNAP) and food insecurity. This second question builds on results found in Bottan and Perez-Truglia (2015) who find that a negative shock to religious participation decreased charitable giving and in turn reduced their provision of public goods (measured by employment in service providers). Using data from the CPS, I will be able to go a step further in this analysis and quantify whether the negative shock affected demand for SNAP and food insecurity.",2,Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement,CPSFS,Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,POP_TABLES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Nicolas L Bottan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, evidence and analysis regarding the end-use of traded goods relies on characterizations that are available only for broad product categories, ad hoc in their characterization of goods, out of date, and not specific to U.S. economic activities. This research implements a new classification of end-use categories for traded goods that (i) characterizes end-use according to observed economic activity among U.S. firms, and (ii) measures the shares of import activity across sub-populations of different end-users for a wide variety of products. This project will identify firms in retail versus production sectors of the economy from the Longitudinal Business Database, and then classify imports by firms in retail sectors (production sectors) as having an end-use as consumption goods (intermediate goods). This strategy accounts for the fact that two different types of firms may import the same product for different end-uses. Measuring differences in end-uses of traded goods is key to identifying the determinants of import demand, and subsequently to understanding how exchange rate shocks pass-through to consumer prices, how aggregate import demand characteristics have changed over time, and how U.S. consumers and firms engage with the global economy.",13,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,Standard Statistical Establishment List - non Name and Address File,SSL_XNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Linmei Amaya,Elizabeth M Johnson,Nicholas Sly,Anson Soderbery,Nikolas J Zolas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last three decades, growth in the prison population in the United States has been the largest in history. One of the biggest challenges in siting new prisons is resistance from local communities. Commonly cited negative impacts of prisons include falling property values, stunted local economic growth, and damage to the community’s reputation and ability to retain and attract businesses. However, prisons are not always unwelcome. Many rural towns have chosen to tie their economies to prisons, believing the institutions provide recession-proof jobs and often a much-needed boost to the stagnant local economy.

This research will produce forecasts about (i) which workers in which locations would be most affected by alternative forms of local labor demand shocks (plant relocations, stimulus packages, natural disasters), (ii) the degree to which differential access to jobs with strong career paths, differential promotions, and differential frequency and quality of outside offers (conditional on job type) contribute to gender and racial income disparities at different points in the life cycle, (iii) how the earnings distributions by race and gender are likely to evolve in the next decade, given the differences in the racial, gender, and educational attainment composition of entering vs. exiting cohorts in the U.S labor market, and (iv) how assortative matching patterns along various dimensions might change as the occupational and industry composition of the labor demand changes, given the degree to which occupation and industry affect search costs in the marriage market.

1803,Active,Franchising and Labor Market Outcomes,Cornell,2019,,Rosemary L Batt,"This research will examine the relationship between the use of the franchising business model and labor market outcomes. We will use two datasets: the Census Bureau's Economic Census (2007 and 2012) and the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data (LEHD).  Use of these two data sets will allow us to answer the central research questions in this project: whether and why labor market outcomes vary systematically by ownership characteristics: franchisor versus franchisee status.  The Economic Census asks questions about whether an establishment is linked to a franchise brand.  Use of this data will allow us to identify establishments according to whether they are franchisor-owned or franchisee-owned.  We will link this data to the LEHD data. The LEHD includes the Employment History File (EHF), which will allow us to compute tenure-earnings profiles for workers at a particular firm, as well as the job-to-job transitions of workers between firms, and turnover at the firm and establishment level. In addition, the LEHD includes the Employer Characteristics File (ECF), which gives a rich set of establishment characteristics (industry, ownership, etc.) including firm age and firm size, which will allow us to be the first to address the rise of multi-establishment franchisee-owned firms. The LEHD also includes the Individual Characteristics File (ICF), which will allow us to answer important questions about the age and gender distributions within franchised establishments. Finally, the assignment of worker to establishment within multi-unit firms is imputed. We will require the Unit-to-Worker file, which includes imputed assignment of workers within multi-unit firms.",15,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Rosemary L Batt,Savannah U Kochinke,Johannes F Schmieder,Lily M Seitelman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we are interested in describing how microeconomic forces shape aggregate outcomes through the dynamic behavior of firms. Recent contributions have shown that macroeconomic outcomes are disproportionately affected by specific categories of firms and/or regions. However, aggregate data masks this rich level of heterogeneity. Thus, we use microdata from the Economic Censuses, Longitudinal Business Database, Standard Statistical Establishment List, and Annual Survey of Manufactures to uncover the heterogeneity in aggregate outcomes at the firm and regional level, and to demonstrate its importance for the aggregate economy. In particular, we will document the extent of heterogeneity across plants and firms, and locations in the U.S. economy along several dimensions, including firm creation and growth, and produce several statistical estimates of the contribution of firm- and location-specific factors to the business cycle, labor market fluctuations, secular trends in market power, and business dynamism.",16,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,Andrea Atencio De Leon,Rosemary M Coskrey,Matthew L Haumann,Cooper A Howes,Claudia Macaluso,Nathaniel A Pancost,Marie C Ruiz,William E Schmidt,Chen Yeh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, this research is designed to compare urban/rural TUS-CPS tobacco use behaviors in comparative models examining Appalachia, the Delta, and a region more typical of the United States, to further examine the nuances in rural America.

The working hypothesis is that workers in states that had longer duration of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits worked in jobs with higher quality and were able to find jobs better matched to their abilities. While it is well established that workers take longer to search for jobs if they have access to generous unemployment insurance benefits, their post-unemployment outcomes have not been carefully analyzed in the United States. Only a handful of papers examine the impact of UI on post-employment wages in Austria and Germany. Our study is the first analysis to examine the impact of UI on the quality of jobs and the quality of job matches. We use Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data that provides employer-employee matched data. This allows removing observed and unobserved worker and firm characteristics and to define the quality of the job as the wages of jobs in a firm that cannot be accounted for by the characteristics of the job or the workers in that firm themselves.

While it is well-documented that earnings grow disproportionately during employer transitions, worker-side survey data are silent on the effect on this growth from shocks on the origin and the destination employers. Using matched employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, we estimate how the employers' net size changes and turn-over rate affect workers’ earnings in transition. Particularly, we estimate the contribution of job destruction at the origin to lower earnings growth and of job creation at the destination to higher growth. Turn-over also notably affects earnings growth as climbing the job wage-ladder is closely associated with job switches to employers with declining gross hires.

Evidence of cash flow hedging in household financial planning,Texas,2018,,Xiao Cen,"This research characterizes the two-way spillover effects between the labor and mortgage markets. An understudied facet of home mortgage is its impact on the liquidity profile of the borrowing households. When home equity is low, serving the debt with periodic payments can constitute a real burden to borrowers and may change their risk appetite in the labor market. We document how mortgage debt affects borrowers’ propensity to take riskier jobs, such as working in startups or high-turnover industries, as well as how employment status affects borrowers’ mortgage performance. Using data mainly from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Longitudinal Business Database, and Corelogic deeds, we identify effects utilizing a variety of quasi-exogenous shocks on employment, home equity, and mortgage payments. We expect that mortgage liability discourages borrowers, and especially if the heads of the households are already in debt, from taking a riskier career path and increases the likelihood of staying in a stable job with predictable incomes.

Our outcome variables of interest include a broad set of socioeconomic outcomes; we focus on educational attainment and household income level. Our two aims are to estimate (1) the impacts of five alternative policy/environmental contexts, holding constant each of the other contexts and (2) to explore interactive effects between some of the contexts of interest, where some birth cohorts in some counties could have been exposed to multiple contexts (i.e. both school desegregation and high pollution); in these cases, we will investigate evidence of statistical interaction in the contextual effects. Our focal contexts include school desegregation policies for school ages; exposure to pollutants in utero; hospital desegregation; introduction of welfare programs; and in utero exposure to salt iodization. We will use external, county level data to incorporate these contextual factors for individual in the ACS and Census data. In each case, the ""in utero"" period for each person is operationalized to be the 9-months before the birth date. These benefits cannot be completed with public data because public data do not contain county-of-birth information. Therefore, we are asking for access to restricted data.

Economists and other social scientists have long been interested in the life course impacts of early exposures to environmental and policy conditions. However, it is difficult to empirically uncover causal factors on later socioeconomic attainment.

1871,Active,Organizational Task Environment and Returns to Inventory Leanness,Boston,2022,,Cuneyt Eroglu,"Ever since the 1980's, consultants, experts, and trade press have consistently advised managers to pursue a lean strategy and to lower inventories regardless of industry, product or geographic differences. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that efforts to reduce inventories do not always lead to improved firm performance. It is conceivable that the relationship between inventories and firm performance is moderated by the environment in which a firm operates. The research question addressed in this proposal is to identify the environmental conditions that shape the inventory-performance relationship.

The project will estimate the effect of production environmental characteristics, operationalized through the Organizational Task Environment (OTE), on the relationship of inventory management and firm performance. The effect of inventory leanness is measured by regressing firm performance, measured as profitability or productivity, on an Empirical Leanness Indicator (ELI) estimated using turnover curves. The ELI is defined by the difference in a given firm's inventory as compared to the firm-size adjusted average inventory level for its industry. 

The moderating variables are environmental characteristics which are operationalized through the Organizational Task Environment (OTE). OTE is operationalized along three dimensions, namely munificence, dynamism and complexity. Munificence reflects the abundance or scarcity of production resources and capacity, generally estimated using sales growth. Dynamism refers to environmental volatility and comprises facets of instability and unpredictability, and will be measured by sales volatility over time. Complexity describes the difficulty to understand and manage a firm's environment, and will be proxied by measures of R&D intensity, information technology intensity, and management practices such as decentralization and data driven decision making. Numerous studies have found evidence of the moderating effects of environmental dynamism, complexity and munificence on the strategy-performance relationship of firms within their supply chains. Hence, the central tenet of this research project is that these OTE characteristics define the extent to which inventory leanness is associated with performance improvements in a given industry environment.",21,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,"Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders",M3,Monthly Retail Trade Survey,MRTS,Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey,MWTS,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Cuneyt Eroglu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to leveraging well-established estimates of local commuting zones to assess spillover effects of these actions, we use data from Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics and the Longitudinal Business Database to compute granular overlapping zones and a new measure of local labor and firm competition that we call Regions of Spatial Competition, which should be more accurate for areas on the borders of existing commuting zones. We then compare the mobility and wages of workers in these markets who do and do not experience corporate shocks.

The first part of this project is to understand the interaction between R&D investment decisions and the strategies used by firms to protect intellectual property. This initial descriptive study will be followed by two sets of analyses that will specifically focus on the main economic forces shaping firms’ decisions in innovation. First, we will examine the role of the risks connected with patent litigation in shaping the incentive to patent and innovate.

Our primary contribution will be a focus on geography, specifically how place shapes outcomes for individual workers. Observing the multidimensional patterns of worker adjustment, including mobility outcomes and transition to joblessness, will be highly relevant for understanding worker adjustment to mass layoffs and changing economic circumstances. We will follow individual displaced workers over time as well as across states, link their decisions to individual and local characteristics, and include a wide set of metropolitan-level characteristicsthat could shape worker outcomes, including housing costs, employment growth by industry, and other measures of labor market conditions.

1877,Active,The Insurance Role of the Family: Long-run responses to unemployment shocks,Nebraska,2019,,Daniel Tannenbaum,"The predominant purpose of this research is to benefit the US Census Bureau by presenting updated statistics on employment, marriage and cohabitating patterns, labor force participation, and uptake of public assistance in response to a layoff at the household level. In conjunction with our primary analysis, we also examine unit non-response to the CPS-ASEC after a layoff event and create a crosswalk that links marital status to the LEHD for multiple years. To accomplish this goal, we request the use of restricted data from three datasets, each of which we propose to link separately to the LEHD. These datasets are: (1) the Decennial Census, 2000 and 2010, and 2020 if available, (2) the American Community Survey (ACS), 2008–2015 and 2016-2019 if available, and (3) the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, 1985-2014, and 2015-2019 if available.
One of the goals of this project is to provide a detailed picture of the insurance role of the family. We plan to answer the following questions: 
• What is the effect of worker displacement on the long-run employment and earnings paths of family members, including spouses and adult children? 
• What are the relative roles of family members and public transfer programs over time in recovering the earnings losses of displaced workers? 
• Does worker displacement affect family structure, such as the likelihood of divorce or separation? How does a cohabiting individual differ in their responses to a displacement compared to a married individual? 
These questions are critical for understanding demographic and employment trends in the U.S., such as the decline of male labor force participation. The proposal will produce updated estimates of the effects of worker displacement on families. It will generate statistical estimates of several outcomes of interest: (i) long-run employment and earnings of family members, (ii) usage of public transfer programs, and (iii) family ruptures (such as separation or divorce).
A final and significant contribution of our research is to study how unemployment affects family structure, including the likelihood of separation or divorce, or the likelihood of marriage for non-married individuals. In the last half-century, the U.S. has experienced dramatic changes in family structure, including the rise of cohabiting couples and non-married couples with children.  Do cohabiting partners behave similarly to married partners in providing an insurance role in their labor supply decisions? The answer to this question is important for assessing the generosity of public assistance programs in the modern era of complex family arrangements. Prior work has found that job loss significantly raises the probability of divorce (Charles et al., 2004). Our proposed research will extend this analysis to study longer time horizons, and with an arguably improved identification strategy; in addition, we will include an analysis of cohabiting individuals to get a more complete picture of the dynamics of family structure in relation to unemployment.",11,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Jennifer L Bernard,Daniel Tannenbaum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we document the distribution of the number of foreign suppliers within narrowly defined products to show that top importers typically source their products from multiple suppliers. Next, we explore whether this pattern of supplier diversification can be linked to different sources of risk, including the uncertainty stemming from the supplier’s location and contractual problems that may lead to hold-up. We plan to build a theoretical model of supplier choice under uncertainty and estimate it with the microdata. We will then study how counterfactual shocks, such as an increase in uncertainty in a source country, can affect aggregate trade flows and the overall volatility of the U.S. economy.

1886,Active,The Impact of Health Care Change on Small Employers: Lessons Learned from Massachusetts,Boston,2019,,Alicia S Modestino,"This project will use the MEPS-IC to examine the impact of the 2006 Massachusetts health care law on employers, particularly small employers. The project will explore to what degree the new law increased employer sponsored coverage over what would have occurred in the absence of change, and the change in employer sponsored coverage due to a greater percentage of firms offering coverage, a greater share of employees signing up for coverage, or some combination of the two. The degree to which increases in premiums after change arise from provisions in the law versus the general trend in health care inflation observed across the nation will be performed, and if small employers experienced differences from larger employers. Analysis will uncover if small employers pass on the increase in premiums to their employees or the public sector, if firms increase employee contributions, if employees pay more in terms of cost-sharing (e.g. deductibles, copayments), and if a greater share of employees sign up for public health insurance coverage. 
By studying the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, this project will ascertain whether the MEPS-IC sampling frame is sufficient to evaluate whether the differential impacts of health care changes across states and firms of varying sizes are statistically significant. This question is important to MEPS-IC program planning because many of the recent changes in health insurance options are determined at the state level, information the MEPS-IC is designed to capture. This research will assess whether the MEPS-IC sampling frame is sufficiently robust for conducting analyses at a more granular state/firm size category than what is currently available in the summary tables. The researchers will accomplish this by analyzing changes in coverage and costs at the state level for firms of varying sizes, and benchmarking their results against a state-level survey of Massachusetts employers conducted in 2007 and 2008 by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/National Opinion Research Center (RWJF/NORC). 
Difference-in-difference estimates of the population of firms will be generated of the impact of the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, comparing trends before and after changes in coverage, employer premiums, employee contributions and cost-sharing for employers of various sizes for Massachusetts versus the United States and New England states.",1,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Alicia S Modestino,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficiency gains through consolidation help consumers by decreasing prices, but anti-competitive behavior in the product market hurts consumers by increasing prices. While generally ignored, the same efficiency and competition concerns are relevant for labor markets. If M&A increases efficiency, wages may rise if the gains from efficiency are shared with workers. If M&A increases consolidation in the labor market, wages may fall due to decreased bargaining power for workers. This research uses data from the Longitudinal-Employer Household Dynamics program combined with a dataset of M&A from Thomson Reuters to document the impact of M&A on workers. In particular, we will document how the effect of M&A on wages differs by the level of concentration in the labor market in order to disentangle anti-competitive effects from efficiency effects.

1901,Active,How Do Households Relocate in Response to the Changes in Moving Costs? ,Colorado,2020,,Jared Carbone,"This proposed study will benefit the Census Bureau under Title 13, Chapter 5. Specifically, this project will produce estimates that will provide a greater understanding of the effects of moving costs on relocation decisions for environmental reasons, which will be directly relevant for informing public policy related to environmental justice (criteria 3). Also, this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of geographic variation in environmental factors with a thorough description of the Californian population by geographic location and environmental quality (criteria 11).

Researchers consistently observe households sort themselves in response to regional differences in neighborhood characteristics such as environmental quality, crime rates, and racial mix of the population (Kuminoff et al., 2013; Tiebout, 1956). Environmental justice (EJ) literature has demonstrated that this sorting behavior can explain why certain types of demographic group such as low-income households disproportionately live near undesirable land uses (Banzhaf, 2012; Depro et al., 2015). If households find environmental harm undesirable, demand for housing near such areas will fall, driving local housing prices down. Low-income households may also dislike polluted areas, but they would be less willing to, or able to, pay for a clean environmental. Thus, they may move to locations with pollution to save money in housing expenditure and use it to purchase other goods.

This project will explore the role that barriers to moving in response to environmental harms may play in shaping the patterns found by the EJ literature. In other words, this paper addresses the question: To what extent do moving costs prohibit households from moving to cleaner locations?

Using counterfactual experiments, Lee verifies that lowering moving costs encourage households to move to locations with better air quality.

1908,Completed,How Do U.S. Firms Adjust to Chinese Import Competition?,Baruch,2018,2024.0,Xavier A Giroud,"China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 has led to a surge in U.S. imports from China and a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in industries affected by Chinese import competition. While the implications of this “China Shock” for the U.S. manufacturing sector are well documented, little is known about how U.S. firms—the entities that own plants and employ workers—adjust to the China Shock. Do firms reallocate resources away from affected plants and toward plants in less affected industries? Or do they shift resources towards affected plants, allowing them to compete more effectively against Chinese imports? And what explains the direction and magnitude of the resource reallocation? This research will address these questions by using establishment-level microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, and Annual Survey of Manufactures, and worker-level data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program.",17,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-GALT26-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,POP_TABLES,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Xavier A Giroud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1916,Active,Offshoring and Innovation: How Large are the Benefits of Co-Location?,Penn State,2019,,Wolfgang Keller,"This project has three related parts, each of which is designed to understand the implications of the growing geographic separation of R&D and production for US firms. There are two competing views on this. One view is that offshoring increases US innovation by allowing domestic firms to specialize in what they do best. By shedding activities that can be performed at lower cost offshore US firms become more competitive and have a stronger incentive to engage in R&D (specialization view). A more recent view is that the separation of R&D and production involved in offshoring limits learning-by-doing production insights from reaching the firms’ headquarters and so slows down U.S. innovation: as the country loses manufacturing it also loses its innovation capabilities (hence, called capabilities view). By tackling this question directly our project will inform the Census Bureau on whether its current approach for tracking U.S. innovation should be changed to ensure that it fully captures the various ways in which US firms innovate.
The project will assess the empirical support for the view that firms benefit from the geographic specialization of production and non-production, versus the view that co-location is instead preferable. The central question is: to what extent do firms benefit from co-locating technology creation (such as R&D labs) and production activities in close geographic proximity, either domestically and/or abroad? While interest in understanding the forces underlying the agglomeration (and co-agglomeration) of industries goes back at least to Marshall (1890), with Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr (2010) a major recent contribution to the co-agglomeration literature, the importance of geographic proximity between production and R&D labs for innovation is to date largely unknown.",18,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8.0,Kyle Butts,Xiang Ding,Teresa C Fort,Nathan Goldschlag,Wolfgang Keller,Jack Liang,Peter K Schott,Stephen Yeaple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1917,Active,"The Impact of Credit Access on Entrepreneurship, Income Inequality, and Subsequent Financial Distress",Minnesota,2020,,Gordon M Phillips,"What is the relationship between consumer and firm credit, earnings, and entrepreneurship? In particular, this project aims to uncover the impact of consumer and firm credit on occupational choices (i.e. 'formal' unemployment-insured jobs vs. 'informal' self-employed jobs vs. starting an employer business), the rate at which individuals (either entrepreneurs or wage earners) transition between income and earnings deciles, and the subsequent feedback of income changes to financial distress. In this project we lay out 4 testable hypotheses, as well as multiple identification strategies for each hypothesis.
The general theme of these hypotheses is that households have gained significant amounts of access to credit (defined as the available borrowing limit across all types of credit) over the past 40 years and we want to uncover how this run-up in credit has impacted the real economy. In addition, small firms have gained access to credit through banking reform as has been recently studied by Bai et al. (2016a). The first two hypotheses are aimed at understanding how access to credit has affected individuals' ability to start businesses, the types of employees they hire, innovation, and subsequent earnings inequality. Our identification strategies rely on a mix of IV-estimators and other natural experiments. We also plan to provide several important descriptive statistics, including income and earnings transition matrices for individuals and entrepreneurs as a function of their access to credit as well as other characteristics. 
The third portion of the project is to understand the feedback from income changes to credit access and financial distress to firm outcomes such as purchase of entrepreneurial firms and going public through initial public offerings. We plan to study the relationship between income volatility, firm earnings volatility and access to credit. In particular, how does the level and variability of income affect an individual's ability to obtain a mortgage? What is the impact of income variability and credit access of firms on financial distress for self-employed and working individuals? Simple OLS analyses will go a long way toward understanding these relationships, but we also provide some more sophisticated identification strategies to uncover these relationships. 
The fourth part of the project is to understand worker choice of type of firm to work for.  A major policy issue has been a big drop in entrepreneurship in the US over a long period. Researchers have focused on the actual entrepreneurs - their financing, demographics affecting the supply of potential entrepreneurs, exit options.

This research uses a combination of restricted-access data from the American Community Survey and Decennial Census, plus public data on household assets from corresponding years of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, to investigate omitted variable bias in the relationship between race, teenage motherhood, and high school completion. Our previous work indicates that among mobile home residents (a population group that on average has relatively few financial assets), rates of teenage motherhood and high school completion are similar between Blacks and Whites. The restricted-access data allow us to disentangle wealth effects from social interaction effects via fixed effect control variables created at the tract-level to (approximately) group mobile home residents into mobile home parks. In so doing, we test the hypothesis that omitted variable bias drives the correlation between race, teenage motherhood, and high school completion.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Laurel E Wheeler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to construct fine-grained, highly populated frequency histograms that allow us to estimate a multicomponent statistical model of the income distribution, which better capture the three generative processes that prior researchers have speculated shape the income distribution. Findings will identify the crucial characteristics of each of these processes and inform empirically-based theorizations of different modalities of income appropriation. This will ultimately cast light on the occurrence and consequences of unemployment or partial engagement with labor markets, segmentation and stratification in labor markets, and the relationship between functional and individual income.

1942,Active,"Recessions, Local Labor Markets, and Inequality",Philadelphia,2020,,Bryan A Stuart,"Growing evidence suggests that recessions catalyze lasting changes in the U.S. economy. For example, every recession since 1973 has led to a persistent decrease in earnings per capita in counties where the recession was more severe (Greenstone and Looney, 2010; Stuart, 2017). The overall consequence of this finding depends on why recessions lead to persistent declines in local economic activity. Local economic activity could decline because high-income individuals are more likely to migrate away from places experiencing negative economic shocks (Bound and Holzer, 2000; Notowidigdo, 2013), or because employers change their production process (Jaimovich and Siu, 2015; Hershbein and Kahn, 2017) or shut down (Foster, Grim, and Haltiwanger, 2016). Although a large literature documents the consequences of recessions, there is relatively little evidence that specifically examines why recessions lead to persistent declines in local economic activity.
This project will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by enhancing the measurement of local economic activity and providing new evidence on the effects of recessions on workers, employers, and local labor markets.

1946,Active,Small Businesses and Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance,Colorado,2018,,Patrick Krueger,"Employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is the backbone of coverage and health care in the United States. Yet, there has been a substantial decline in employers offering health insurance, especially among small businesses, over the past 20 years. These small businesses occupy an especially important position in the employment of racial/ethnic minorities, and thus lower rates of ESI provision for small businesses may help explain the lower rates of health coverage among disadvantaged groups. However, not all small businesses fail to provide ESI, and researchers have failed to examine the potential impacts of business owner and community demographics, which may play an important role in explaining ESI coverage. By combining data from the Survey of Business Owners, Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, and Annual Business Survey, we are able to examine ESI provision among small businesses by employer race/ethnicity, employer nativity, and the race/ethnic composition of the surrounding geographic area.

1958,Active,"Shareholder-Creditor Conflicts, Financial Distress, and the Real Economy",UIUC,2018,,Rustom D Manouchehri Irani,"A central tenet of U.S. corporate governance is that management should maximize shareholder value. However, as is now well-understood, shareholder maximization may impose costs on other stakeholders, including creditors and employees, that may not be internalized by shareholders. While there is recent evidence that the conflicts between shareholders and creditors—and even conflicts of interest among different classes of creditors—can have large impacts on corporate policies, there exists limited research analyzing precisely how these conflicts influence resource (mis)allocation in the economy. The purpose of this research is to conduct a micro-level analysis that documents how creditor control and borrower-lender relationships influence the investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions, as well as employees of borrowing firms in (or in close proximity to) financial distress. The Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Quarterly Financial Report, Auxiliary Establishment Survey, and Standard Statistical Establishment List will be used to quantify the effect of credit markets on individual firm behavior and performance, as well as worker earnings. We examine the influence of these conflicts on real activity and employees using two financial distress events that afford creditors greater control over corporate decision-making: bankruptcy and covenant violations (“technical default”). We complement these “ex post” analyses of creditor control with an “ex ante” analysis of The 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act—a major piece of legislation that strengthened shareholders’ rights relative to creditors.

We construct a unit-level panel from the American Housing Survey from 1974 to 2005 to exploit within-city variation caused by the adoption of a unique tax law in several municipalities in New York State. In 1981, New York State created the Homestead Tax Option (HTO), which allowed local governments that adopted the law to charge rental complexes with four or more units a higher property tax rate than rental complexes of three or fewer units. To identify the effect of this policy on renters, we use the census-block code available in the restricted-use data to identify if a surveyed unit is located in a city that adopted the HTO. We then utilize the within-city tax rate changes caused by the HTO to estimate, within a difference-in-differences framework, if and to what degree property owners shift the burden of this tax onto renters. This policy-relevant parameter will give insight into the equity of the property tax system in an urban setting and identify how local tax structures, such as the property tax, contribute to increased housing costs.",1,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,David Schwegman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We combine demographic data from the Decennial Censuses of 1950–2000 with data on wage setting minimums and maximums by occupation and geographical area during World War II. We then estimate the impact of wage controls on wage inequality using spatial discontinuity in wage setting across War Labor Board regions and zones. In particular, we compare economically similar proximate towns located in different War Labor Board regions and zones and, thus, subject to different wage regulation during World War II. Using this approach, we will estimate the effect of minimum and maximum wages on wage inequality and employment using the 1950–2000 Decennial Censuses to estimate the dynamic impacts of the regulation after it was rescinded. In doing so, this project sheds light on the causes of the decline in inequality experienced in the post-war period and contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the importance of institutions for inequality.

1971,Active,"Work, Disability Insurance, and Multiple-Earner Households",Chicago,2022,,Maxwell Kellogg,"This project proposes to analyze interactions between household work and U.S. disability insurance (DI) programs. Within the context of a household model of life cycle consumption and labor supply, we will use those interactions to examine the welfare and behavioral effects of changing the environment in which work, DI application, and consumption decisions are made. We propose to do this using the linked SIPP-SSA data. This proposal is motivated primarily by three features of DI programs in the United States which could generate substantial variation in the costs of applying for DI, depending on the characteristics of one's household. The first of these features is that DI application process is both long and uncertain (in terms of duration of the decision period and application outcome).  The second feature is that no constraints are placed on the earnings of other members of an applicant's household. Therefore, there is room for households to maintain income during the application process through other household members. The third feature is that access to medical insurance coverage is very limited during the application process. This feature is unique to DI programs of the United States, among developed countries; private medical insurance in the United States is closely tied to employment. These three features suggest that the (exogenously determined) composition of household structures in the United States has implications for the work disincentive effects and welfare value of the country's DI programs. With the unique interactions between medical insurance coverage and employment in the United States, the household may have a more important role to play in driving who applies for DI benefits in the United States than in other countries.",7,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,SSA Detailed Earnings Record (DER) SIPP Extract,SSA_DER_SIPP,SSA Master Beneficiary Record (MBR) SIPP Extract,SSA_MBR_SIPP,SSA Payment History Update System (PHUS) SIPP Extract,SSA_PHUS_SIPP,SSA Summary Earnings Record (SER) SIPP Extract,SSA_SER_SIPP,SSA Supplemental Security Record (SSR) SIPP Extract,SSA_SSR_SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Marai M Hayes,Ezra Karger,Maxwell Kellogg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1975,Active,Firm Organization Across Space,Boston,2019,,Teresa C Fort,"This project will use micro data to document firms’ organization of activities across space, and to assess how differences in firms’ geography and international trade activity affect their performance and innovation. A key element in the project is understanding firms’ decisions to own multiple establishments across different locations and industries. We will link detailed input usage data and product line information from the Census of Manufactures (CMF) and the Census of Retail Trade (CRT) to the international trade transactions databases. We will use these rich data to assess whether within-firm variation across establishments and international trade data can be used to impute missing data at the establishment level. We will also assess the extent to which the specific inputs or products that are pre-listed on the various economic census forms can be updated both to gather more relevant information and to reduce respondent burden. This project will also assess the extent to which various decisions, such as technology upgrading, take place at the establishment versus firm level. We will combine technology information from various surveys to document whether use of different technologies, such as electronic networks, are made at the establishment or firm level. By comparing technology responses across surveys, we can shed light on the accuracy of individual surveys. Most importantly, assessing the extent of heterogeneity within a firm and across establishments will provide the Census Bureau with valuable information on whether future technology surveys need to be conducted at the firm versus establishment level.",30,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Monthly Retail Trade Survey,MRTS,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18.0,Melissa Chow,Xiang Ding,Jonathan I Dingel,Teresa C Fort,Nathan Goldschlag,Wolfgang Keller,Jack Liang,Chenchen Peng,Christina M Qiu,Hannah F Rubinton,Peter K Schott,Dominic Smith,Chad W Syverson,Cristina Tello-Trillo,Felix Tintelnot,Jeffrey Wang,Stephen Yeaple,Nikolas J Zolas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1987,Active,Managerial Incentives in the Asset Management Industry,Boston,2022,,Kevin Mullally,"This research proposes to study managerial incentives in the mutual fund industry by primarily investigating two questions: First, does the labor market for mutual fund managers discipline poorly performing managers? Second, how is managerial compensation determined? 
To answer these questions, the researchers will request a number of internal databases, most notably Longitudinal Employer-Household Database (LEHD), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), and Compustat-SSEL Bridge files; and for external databases, Morningstar, LexisNexis Public Records, MFLinks, CRSP, and Thompson Reuters. The researchers either have subscription or membership for all external databases. All of the internal databases are requested for the years between 1990 and the latest year available, with the exception of LBD used to more accurately pin down firm age.  
The research will benefit the Census as the researchers plan to conduct a systematic assessment of the firm age variable by statistically comparing the Morningstar data with relevant data from various US Census programs. Morningstar provides a unique and an accurate way of calculating firm age for these mutual fund companies, which involves using a combination of advanced textual analysis to extract mutual funds' prospectus and tracking using a variety of different methods the inception dates of each fund affiliated with a mutual fund company. This comparison will shed light on the current methodology employed by Census to calculate its firm age variable in the LBD, i.e., firm age is counted as the age of the oldest establishment.",8,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,"State - Education - University of Central Florida, MIMFI",STATE_EDU_UCF_MIMFI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Jianqiu Bai,Kevin Mullally,Aisulu Munkina,Yuehua Tang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1988,Active,Research and Development Laboratories in the Production Process,Cornell,2019,,Kristy Buzard,"This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by expanding the understanding of how research and development (R&D) investments contribute to the productivity of firms--both the firms that undertake the investments directly as well as neighboring firms that benefit from spillover effects. Specifically, combining a unique data set of geocoded R&D labs with firm-level data from Compustat and restricted-use Census data at the firm- and establishment-level, this project will first describe how firms locate their R&D labs relative to their own production and administrative establishments as well as the labs of other firms. It will then estimate the impact of R&D labs, the locations and characteristics of those labs and the clusters in which the labs are located, and the position of labs within the production structure of the firm on total firm productivity. The researchers will test whether these estimates vary by industry, firm size, or presence of multiple labs within the firm. In addition, the researchers will use their proprietary data on R&D clusters and the strength of knowledge spillovers within them to produce population estimates of the impact of being located within R&D clusters or near the labs of other firms in one’s own industry. These estimates will help to form a more complete picture of our local and national innovation ecosystems. Given the well-established linkages between research and development (R&D), productivity, and economic growth, we believe that the results will be of broad application and interest.
The study will also provide a better understanding of how well establishments devoted to research and development are identified in the Census data. This is possible because our R&D establishment data is of very high quality. Being able to identify establishments as R&D-performing and having good detail as to the type of research performed there is essential for answering important questions related to the environment for innovation and firm production structures. When data on R&D are aggregated to the firm level as in the SIRD, this kind of analysis is impossible.

The study will investigate the earnings and employment of individuals who have interacted or will interact with the criminal justice system, as well as the characteristics of the firms that hire them. Involvement in the criminal justice system in the U.S. has large and negative impacts on earnings and employment; however, little is known about the mechanisms that cause this drop in earnings, including the relative contributions of non-employment, limited industry and occupational mobility, and lack of on-the-job earnings growth. Relatedly, there is currently no research into the firms that hire ex-offenders, including their industry and occupational distributions, wage profiles, workforce characteristics, and growth trajectories. It is possible that a large part of the earnings losses associated with having a criminal record comes through sorting of workers to firms in typically low wage or low growth industries.

While in most states kindergarten began as a voluntary program, starting in the 1970s some states evolved to mandating kindergarten attendance. Several changes in state mandatory school entrance laws across—and in some instances, within—states over time provide an opportunity to causally identify the influence of an additional year of early-childhood education on important individual education and labor market outcomes, comparing states with mandatory attendance to those with voluntary attendance. Using a natural experiment design, we exploit variation in kindergarten requirements between 1970 and 2000 using pooled repeated cross-sections for individuals born between 1965 and 1995 observed in the 2000 Decennial Census and the 2001–2016 American Community Survey.

Social capital (SK) can be defined as “the societal analogue of physical or economic capital—the value inherent in friendship networks and other associations that individuals and groups can draw upon to achieve private or collective objectives.” Previous literature indicates that community and individual SK is important in determining who becomes an entrepreneur. However, much of the previous analyses used small samples sizes or weak measures of social capital. In this research, we will use the 2000 Decennial Census, the 2000 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, and an external data set, the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), to address the following questions: (1) What types of social capital (structural or cognitive) are more important in predicting self-employment, both at the individual and community levels? (2) How important is the role of social capital in the transition between paid employment or unemployment to self-employment? (3) In the transition to self-employment, how does social capital influence an individual to remain in the same occupation or industry?

To address this information gap, this research develops small area estimates of home repair need for occupied housing units using American Housing Survey (AHS), American Community Survey (ACS), and proprietary repair cost data. We estimate the unit-level total cost of repairs by relating cost estimates to housing problems reported in the AHS. AHS units are then merged with publicly available tract- and region-level data from the ACS using geographic identifiers available in the restricted-use AHS file. We develop multilevel regression models to predict repair costs using characteristics of the unit, surrounding census tract, and region. We apply the resulting models to publicly-available data to produce aggregate tract-level estimates using a post-stratification approach. The resulting estimates will help decision makers understand the scope and magnitude of home repair needs and target resources accordingly.

A newly available dataset shows that innovative activity, broadly defined, is far more prevalent in rural areas than commonly believed; this dataset for the first time also allows in-depth research to examine the roles of different types of innovation in rural firm success. By combining this nationally representative, novel establishment-level dataset with detailed Census micro data we can test hypotheses about the emergence and viability of rural entrepreneurship that could not be examined previously. In addition, by linking the establishment survey with founders’ information in the Census Survey of Business Owners the research will provide unique insights on female and minority entrepreneurship.  We will use appropriate econometric methods including selection and survival models, quantile regression and two-sample two-stage least squares to address these questions. In addition to devising a new taxonomy of county-level entrepreneurship and presenting more refined measures of innovation, we are able to determine the precise role played by different types of innovation in firm success measured by, among other factors, earnings, survivability and the ability to compete internationally.

2090,Active,Competition and Economic Growth,Chicago,2019,,Ezra Karger,"The purpose of this project is to investigate the link between economic competition and economic growth. The goal is to empirically analyze the effect of competition on households, firms, and industries. Economists have explored this question theoretically, but all empirical analyses use small non-representative subsets of firms or identifies correlational (and not causal) relationships. A fundamental economic question is whether increased competition between firms in the same industry increases research and development, innovation, the numbers of new firms entering the industry, and the number of employees in the industry. One important measure of competition is industry and region-level concentration. We will use Census microdata to first describe industry and region-level variation in concentration between the 1960s and 2017. We will then identify the causal effect of changes in industry concentration on the economic outcomes of industries, firms, and households using lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice against firms and industries, the entry and exit of firms into local economic areas, and data describing mergers and acquisitions. This project will also provide insight into several additional important questions. For example, if an industry is very concentrated, then do fewer new companies enter the industry? If a local economic area has a small number of competitors within a specific sector, does that negatively affect local economic growth? If two companies within an industry merge, how does that affect their competitors? If an industry suddenly becomes more concentrated, how are different types of employees affected? And how do all of these effects vary by region and industry?",24,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-GALT26-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Tania Babina,Simcha Barkai,Jesse Bruhn,Ezra Karger,Scott C Loring,Sean McConville,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2109,Active,Firms and Workers: Volatility and Inequality,Stanford,2020,,Nicholas A Bloom,"Income inequality has increased substantially in the United States over the last 30 years (see Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 for a survey). However, whether the dispersion of earnings growth - what is known as income volatility or instability - has also increased and what the nature of this instability is remains the subject of considerable debate. Following the seminal work of Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), several researchers have found that income instability has increased over the past two decades. Recent work using administrative data, however, indicates a declining trend or no trend at all (e.g. Sabelhaus and Song, 2010). Moreover, most of the existing research focuses on worker characteristics, even though firm characteristics and the extent to which workers transition across different employment states and different employers could be equally, if not more important, to explain the evolution the extent and evolution of income instability.
This project proposes to combine employer-employee linked data from the Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics (LEHD) program with other administrative and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as external data to inform the Census Bureau about the evolution and nature of income inequality and income instability. Precise estimation on the evolution of the dispersion of the growth rates of labor income, a measure of income instability, is crucial to measure the degree of uncertainty or risks that workers face, informs our understanding of the evolution of income inequality, and has important economic and policy implications (see Low et al., 2010; Guvenen and Smith, 2014; and the references therein).",48,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs,ASE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data PIK Crosswalk,IP_INVENTOR_CROSSWALK,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-GALT26-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,Vanessa I Alviarez,Adrien Auclert,Nicholas A Bloom,Bharat K Chandar,Camille Hillion,Zong Yang Huang,Andre Kurmann,Brendan Moore,Katherine A Reinmuth,Sergio Salgado Ibanez,Rachel Schuh,Isaac N Sorkin,Tasaneeya Viratyosin,Alex J Wellman,Guanyu Zhou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2111,Active,Unions and Technology Adoption in U.S. Manufacturing,Baruch,2019,,Eric Verhoogen,"In the competitive world economy, firms will only be able to support high-quality employment if they continually find ways to adopt new and more sophisticated technologies. One determinant of adoption is the extent to which employees are willing to share information about new technologies, and how employment contracts shape their incentives to do so. Since Freeman and Medoff’’s landmark book, “What Do Unions Do?” (1984), the fact that unions may help to improve communication within firms and contribute to productivity improvements has been widely appreciated. But despite a fair amount of research documenting correlations between unionization and productivity or innovation, there have not been any studies that use experimental or quasi-experimental research design to estimate the causal relationship unionization and technology adoption. The current project seeks to fill that gap. We propose to use the discontinuity generated by the majority-vote rule in National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) elections to investigate the causal effect of unionization on technology adoption. The main research question is: how does unionization of a firm (or establishment) affect its propensity to adopt new, advanced technologies or management practices? The project will estimate the effect of unionization by comparing workplaces where unions narrowly won representation elections to workplaces where unions narrowly lost. The argument underlying this strategy, known as a “regression discontinuity design,” is that the workplaces where unions narrowly won or lost will be on average similar on other dimensions, including unobserved dimensions, and hence that comparing them can isolate the causal effect of union representation. The project will draw on information on all unionization elections supervised by the NLRB from 1961 to 2015. This information will be merged primarily with two Census Bureau datasets, the Survey of Manufacturing Technology (SMT) for 1988, 1991, and 1993, and the Managerial and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) for 2010 and 2015 and will draw on  supplemental information from other Census datasets.",8,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Kyle G Coombs,Eric Verhoogen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2114,Completed,Civic Engagement and Citizens' Context,Philadelphia,2021,2023.0,Lee Shaker,"This project examines the link between Americans' context--defined as their physical, social, and informational environment--and their civic engagement (e.g. participating in community groups, engaging in boycotts, etc.) in order to improve understanding of the Volunteering & Civic Life Supplement (VCL) of the Current Population Survey and suggest possible changes to its sampling strategy for future iterations. Traditionally, studies of civic engagement in the United States either use relatively small national surveys to give a general overview of Americans' behavior or employ mixed methods to delve more deeply into behavior within a handful of specific communities. To extend beyond these two approaches, I will use large Census datasets to conduct multilevel analysis of civic engagement nationwide that considers the influence of both individual and local/contextual factors. In addition, I will compare models created using the Census Civic Engagement Supplement (2008-2011, 2013) and VCL Supplement (2017-2019) datasets with similar models that include many other related political attitudes and behaviors measured by the General Social Survey and American National Election Survey (but with fewer respondents). This research offers three key benefits for Census. First, preparations for the analysis require detailed investigation of the previous year-by-year and country-by-county samples for the CES/VCL. This examination will underpin an assessment of the sampling frame's strengths and weaknesses for measuring civic engagement over time in disparate types of communities. Second, comparative analysis with external surveys that include measurement of additional related variables will contextualize findings from the VCL and improve our understanding of its results. Third, the emphasis on community context and the use of multilevel models complements existing Federal/Census approaches to estimating civic health and may contribute to future strategies for understanding civic health in different types of communities across the rural-urban spectrum.",2,CPS Civic Engagement Supplement,CPSCIVIC,Current Population Survey Volunteering and Civic Life Supplement,CPSVACL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Soojong Kim,Lee Shaker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will produce some descriptive statistics and regression estimates of population diversity within firms and the effects on productivity that are not contained in existing publications. Employment diversity is one of the important aspects of the corporate culture. In recent years, the importance of the corporate culture for firms' performance attract more and more attention. The effects of employment diversity have not been fully investigated. There are different kinds of employment diversity such as ethnic diversity, age diversity, education diversity, and gender diversity. How do these different aspects of diversity affect firms' productivity? Do some of these diversities have positive effects while others have negative effects on firms' productivity?  The LEHD data are particularly well-suited to explore these questions. 
In this project the researcher will use the LEHD Individual Characteristics File to construct firm/establishment level age, gender, educational and ethnic diversity measures. The researcher will link these measures to firm (and when possible, establishment) records in the Economic Census, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Annual Retail Trade Survey and Annual Wholesale Trade Survey. Then the researcher will use these files to generate firm/establishment productivity measures. After generating the diversity and productivity measures, the project will show the descriptive statistics of all measures. Moreover, the study will develop regression estimates of the effects of firm/establishment level diversities on firm/establishment level productivity.

2129,Active,Are Firms' Internal Capital Markets Efficient? Evidence from Regional Government Subsidies,Stanford,2021,,Rebecca Lester,"This project will study firms' internal capital markets by examining companies' responses to divisional cash shocks. Prior literature documents various frictions affecting the allocation of assets within a firm, such as regulatory requirements or agency costs. As a result, whether, to what extent, and where a cash flow shock will be spent by a firm is an open empirical question. Our ""shocks"" to capital flows are subsidies awarded to firms by regional (e.g., state, county, or city) governments, which occur frequently over our sample period. We consider two main types of subsidies - cash grants and regional tax exemptions - that either decrease a firm's operating costs for a certain period of time (in the case of regional tax exemptions) or increase a firm's available capital by providing a ""windfall"" (in the case of cash grants) in the specific subsidizing jurisdiction. Our dataset consists of a large sample of approximately 50,000 tax subsidies and cash grants awarded to over 2,000 companies since 2004. Additionally, we will use the Economic Census, the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES), and other Census datasets. Our tests provide insight into the extent to which firms efficiently redeploy their assets and the potentially different effects of the cash flow shocks provided by the two different types of subsidies we consider. We also intend to show how frictions, such as regulatory restrictions and agency costs, affect firms' internal asset allocations.

In this research project, we model the relationship between SNAP participation and educational attainment for young adults, and examine whether differences in SNAP work requirements affect that relationship. In early adulthood, SNAP may play a role in improving the feasibility of time-intensive educational investments by helping meet basic needs. This role may be limited, however, by the restrictions on SNAP access placed on young adults without children, many of whom face work requirements for eligibility unless their state or county successfully applies for a federal waiver of the requirement. We will use the Survey of Income and Program Participation, combined with administrative data on SNAP from seven states and policy data on work-requirement waivers by county, to determine whether work requirements create a meaningful barrier to SNAP for young adults, and whether SNAP access plays an important role in educational attainment. Using a variety of quasi-experimental methods including regression analyses and instrumental variables models, we expect to see reduced SNAP take-up in areas with work requirements, and potentially less educational investment by young adults with such barriers to SNAP participation.

2137,Active,Housing Choice Voucher Program Outcomes,Seattle,2019,,Rebecca J Walter,"The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the largest tenant-based rental housing subsidy in the nation. Prior research presents mixed evidence regarding the location outcomes for recipient households. This project seeks to identify the types of households, market conditions, and neighborhood composition that are more likely to promote mobility and access to high-opportunity neighborhoods for voucher recipients. It will extend past research on the HCV program to address these questions at a national scale and analyze temporal dynamics (such as conditions pre- and post-voucher receipt), a feature that is absent in the existing literature.
This research will produce new comparative statistics about the static and time-varying representation of voucher and non-voucher households according to neighborhood characteristics. For example, we will examine the characteristics of neighborhoods that see a relatively quick loss of HCV households within a short period of time. Further, this project will simulate outcome projections of the implementation of Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs), broadly and based on sociodemographic and market factors. By identifying the proportion of HCV households likely impacted by SAFMRs, and their probable characteristics, this research will offer timely insight into the efficacy of this approach to setting voucher standards. Additionally, this research will yield a variety of estimates describing voucher households and their residential mobility behavior based on recipient, household, housing unit, market, and other locational characteristics.

2149,Active,The effect of child support on mothers' labor supply,Chicago,2020,,Pinchuan Ong,"According to the Census Bureau, 26.6 percent of all children under 21 did not live with both parents in 2013 (Grall, 2016). Because of the large number of children affected, and because they tend to be disproportionately poor, a lot of thought goes into how much child support these families should receive from the noncustodial parent. In particular, economic theory predicts that receipt of child support should reduce the custodial parents' (mothers for simplicity) incentives to work, in the same way that public transfers do.
Despite the welfare implications of the reduction in work incentives, the literature on how child support affects mothers' labor supply is relatively small. Earlier papers are limited in their ability to handle endogeneity, relying mainly on father-side information and cross-state differences in the legal environment as a source of exogenous variation. Two recent papers provide more causal estimates. Cuesta & Cancian (2015) exploit the experimental design of the Wisconsin Child Support Demonstration Evaluation and find that child support did not have a labor supply effect for mothers on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Rossin-Slater & Wűst (2016) exploit the Danish child support formula's dependence on income and number of children to construct a simulated instrument, and finds no effect on mothers' labor supply. 
This project differentiates from the two by, firstly using a different source of variation, and secondly examining a different population. In particular, it aims to provide a causal estimate for the general population of mothers receiving support in the US. 
For a causal estimate, this project will exploit the dependence of child support payments on children age in a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design. In order to implement this, month-level details on marriage and fertility (suppressed in public-use data) from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) will be needed.

To show within-firm efficiency, I study firm-specific TFP and geographic mobility. For across-firm efficiency and resource allocation (i.e., shifting the allocation of labor and capital). I study whether resources move towards firms with higher productivity within local industries, whether there are disproportionate effects on smaller and younger businesses, and whether there are resource allocation dynamics between public and private establishments (e.g., standard general equilibrium effects).

Empirically analyzing the research question has been difficult because of both data and identification challenges. The analyses of ex ante regulatory design require state-level disclosure jurisdictions. To construct this measurement, I use machine learning techniques to dissect judicial opinions at state-level cases to document how rigorous and specific disclosure requirements are within the state.

Then, we will merge association measures from the Census 2000 at the tract level with the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), which contain information on social cohesion. Using ordinal multilevel logistic regressions, we will investigate whether measures of association predict trust in neighbors, net of contextual controls that are derived from the Census 2000 and data from the Department of Justice (DOJ UCR 2000). Our work will contribute to the scholarly debate on the implications of ethnoracial diversity on social cohesion. Recent studies have argued that diversity in communities diminishes cohesion, for instance, by reducing trust in neighbors. Yet classical research on social integration suggests that it is the association, or ""consolidation"", of multiple dimensions of social life (i.e. ethnic background and household income) that actually impede integration by impeding the existence of multifaceted social groups and intersecting social norms.

Next, we will document the causes of eviction, focusing on the importance of demographic and socioeconomic factors, including family type, gender, and income level. To inform policy and programmatic responses, we will then analyze the consequences of eviction on housing search, housing quality, and neighborhood quality.

2176,Active,Does Firm Corporate Governance Affect Worker Outcomes?,Boston,2020,,Dylan K Nelson,"This project analyzes how firm corporate governance affects worker outcomes. Corporate governance can be defined as the institutions within each firm that govern its decision-making, and the resulting balance of power between stakeholder groups. Contemporary trends in corporate governance include increased owner control over executives, the emergence of new styles of ownership to fund and restructure firms, and a large decline in the number of publicly listed firms. We use Census longitudinally-linked data to analyze the relationship between these trends and individual worker and worker household outcomes including earnings, employment, and occupational attainment. We begin our project by using novel network methods to impute occupation into the LEHD. We then describe the relationship between corporate governance and worker outcomes, using variance decomposition, regression, and Markovian modeling. We thirdly estimate the effect of firm governance transitions on worker outcomes, for example private equity buy-outs.

2181,Active,Dynamic Export Capabilities and Export Venture Success,Atlanta,2022,,Kelly Hewett,"Firms predominantly choose exporting in their efforts to grow via international expansion. As managers formulate their overall exporting strategies, including what products to export, which markets represent the best opportunities for their next export venture(s), and in which markets they should cease export activities, accumulated export experience and related learning play an important role, a phenomenon often referred to in the marketing literature as learning-by-exporting. While the economic trade literature has explored issues associated with exporting a number of products and exporting to a number of markets,  there remain gaps regarding the extent to which exporting different products and exporting to different markets enhance learning from exporting and how much each type of learning (from markets and from products) influences export success. To fill these gaps, we will explore how exporting firms maximize learning based on their export experiences with market and with products.  Specifically, in this project, we will answer the following questions: Does learning from exporting the same product to different markets or different products to the same market contribute more to a firm's export capabilities; how will learning from exporting change over time; and do export capabilities affect export venture survival? To answer these questions, we will estimate multivariate regression models using the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD).",4,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Kelly Hewett,Luciano Lapa,Amy Lim,Baridhi Malakar,Annette Tower,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will consider how changes in market power and consumer demand are related to the evolution of prices, productivity, markups, and costs. Our main research questions are: 1. What is the establishment-level productivity and the degree of price dispersion across various sectors and locations in the U.S. economy? 2. How much have markups risen in various sectors of the U.S. economy over the past several decades? 3. Does controlling for changing markups, particularly establishment-level price changes, significantly change the measured productivity growth both at the sector-level and across industries? 
To answer these questions, we will jointly estimate a flexible structural model of consumer demand and the production technology used in each 6-digit NAICS sector, relying on data observed in standard plant-level datasets. Applying these methods to the detailed data from the Census Bureau, we will study how the evolution of productivity and market power has occurred in different industries, geographies, and in aggregate. In particular, we will examine and pay special attention to non-manufacturing sectors as they account for the majority of the economy.

Such firms must consider not only the effects of collocation with competing firms, but also the competitive effects of their own alternate establishments. These decisions become more complicated as the multi-unit firm may also operate under multiple brands, which allows the firm to differentiate an establishment not only from its external competitors, but also from its own, internal, competing locations. The interaction of geography, brand, and ownership incentives gives rise to multiple questions concerning establishment performance, strategic differentiation, strategic behavior across geographic markets, overall system (across establishment) performance, and the evolution of local geographic markets. 
This project draws on the intersection of economic and management literatures on agglomeration effects, brand diversification, and multi-unit ownership incentives. We use establishment-level Census data from the U.S. lodging industry to exam how geographic collocation (or clustering), ownership structures, and the nature of diversification within the cluster affect performance at the establishment level. We further distinguish between multi-unit franchisees versus franchisor-owned establishments. We examine whether multi-unit owners choose to diversify their portfolio of businesses either geographically or in brand/quality space. We examine whether and how multi-unit ownership affects the decision to enter or likelihood of exiting a particular geographic market. We also examine whether multi-market contact between firms affects pricing behavior and performance across geographic markets, and whether it matters whether such contact is at the brand or ownership levels.

Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods still compares how ""clean"" versus ""dirty"" industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, the availability of firm and plant-level data makes it possible to recognize that firms within an industry differ very widely. Even within a narrowly defined industry firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces.

A long literature in corporate finance has studied the connection between firm ownership, capital structure, and investment. Going public helps firms diversify their funding sources, relaxing financial constraints (Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales 1998). On the other hand, going public increases separation between ownership and control possibly worsening agency problems (Jensen and Meckling 1976). However, evidence on the importance of these mechanisms, and on the net benefits of public ownership, is limited. This is because it is difficult to observe capital structure and investment decisions of private firms. Quantifying the benefits of going public has become a more pressing question in recent years since the number of publicly traded US corporations has declined substantially since the early 2000’s (Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz 2017).

2228,Active,"""Fixing"" 1990-2010 Census Geography: Geocoding Restricted Data and Assessing Public Estimates",Minnesota,2019,,Jonathan Schroeder,"We propose to address two major limitations of existing Census Bureau data products. First, the restricted-access 1990 and 2000 census microdata lack precise geographic coordinates for the residences of respondents. This limitation prevents Census analysts and others from conducting high-precision spatial analysis and modeling with 1990 and 2000 data. The second major limitation to be addressed is the problem of inconsistencies across time in the summarized geographic units in public census summary data. Where the extents of geographic units change between censuses, it can be impossible to determine how the units' populations have changed. To address this problem, several secondary data providers have produced geographically standardized census data series, which give estimates of population and housing characteristics across multiple census years for a single, fixed set of geographic units. The rapidly growing use of these products is concerning because errors in standardized data are potentially severe, but the real magnitude of errors remains undetermined. 
We would use restricted census microdata to address these issues in three ways. First, we will geocode all 1990 and 2000 census responses as nearly as possible to the standards of the current Master Address File. This will dramatically increase the quality and usefulness of restricted-access census microdata for these years.

On consumption, we aim to use detailed micro-data to measure which consumers buy imported products or domestic products that use imported intermediate inputs, by building a new bridge between the Census data and product-level consumption data from the Nielsen Company. On earnings, we propose to comprehensively measure the exposure of U.S. workers to various facets of international trade, namely import competition, export opportunities, and the use of imported intermediate inputs using the Census' surveys of firms and customs data. On inequality, we use a model to infer the distributional consequences of trade via consumption and earnings from the empirical patterns observed in the data. The project relies on several Census datasets: SSL and LBD to match external consumption data to firm microdata; Economic Census (for both manufacturing and other sectors), Annual Surveys, and LFTTD to measure firms' exposure to international trade; LEHD to measure worker exposure to trade; and finally CFS, SIRD, and BRDIS to understand the role of geography of sales and innovation in how U.S. consumers benefit from trade.",22,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Lydia Cox,Jiashuo Feng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2234,Active,Firm Investment under Uncertainty: Evidence from Gubernatorial Elections,Texas,2021,,Elizabeth A Berger,"This project will use internal Census business data to study how uncertainty affects firm investment, the methods that firms use to insulate themselves from uncertainty, and the factors that drive responses to uncertainty. 

Empirically, proving a causal relationship between uncertainty and firm activities is challenging because economic uncertainty is tied to the business cycle, which directly determines firm investment. Hence, a major empirical challenge is to disentangle the effects of uncertainty from those of the business cycle. Additionally, aggregate firm-level data are not granular enough to properly identify the actions of large firms whose operations span multiple countries and US states. The empirical design of this project resolves these inherent identification problems by using establishment-level data in a setting where gubernatorial elections serve as an instrument for uncertainty.  

The findings will provide new evidence about the effects of uncertainty on investment both in the short and long run.  We estimate effects on several proxies for investment: establishment births and deaths based on the Longitudinal Business Database, capital expenditures and plant utilization from the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization, research and development as measured in the Business Research & Development and Innovation Survey and Survey of Industrial Research and Development, and patents from USPTO data linked at the establishment level. The results will shed light on the types of investment distortions induced by uncertainty (e.g., intangible and tangible investment substitution).  Moreover, the results will assess whether these are short-term distortions or whether they persist in the long run.",10,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Elizabeth A Berger,Jingqiu Ren,Morad Zekhnini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is consensus in the literature that a more efficient financial sector allows for a better allocation of resources towards more-productive firms, spurring aggregate productivity and economic growth, most research only considers established firms, ignoring the creation of new firms. We analyze how credit shocks impact entry and exit of firms, as well as the productivity, size, and debt structure of firms that enter, and how such conditions persist over time. We do so by combining the Longitudinal Business Database, which tracks entry and exit for the universe of employer establishments and firms, with the Quarterly Financial Report, which includes balance sheet and income statement information for privately-owned firms, as well as local CRA lending data, Compustat financials, and the Economic Census.

In light of recent research, we identify whether the cause of the oil price fluctuations is driven by demand or supply shocks. We expect that more oil dependent industries, such as the auto manufacturing sector, will show higher levels of responsiveness than industries traditionally associated with lower oil use; this change in magnitude, however, should diminish when accounting for supply elasticity and supply or demand driven shocks. While prior research on labor reallocation primarily uses more aggregated data, this masks some of the smaller changes occurring in the labor market. As such, by using data from the Census Bureau we are able to more thoroughly investigate the responsiveness of the labor market by accounting for subindustries based off of NAICS codes and additional characteristics, such as capital intensity, energy intensity, and trade intensity.",5,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Ryan Hanson,Ana M Herrera,Steven Lugauer,Kenneth Troske,Linli Zhao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2271,Active,Measuring the Long-Run Health and Economic Effects of Childhood Health Shocks: Evidence from 1950s Atmospheric Nuclear Testing and the Salk Poliomyelitis Vaccine Trial of 1954,Chicago,2021,,Joseph Ferrie,"Early life experiences have the potential to affect the health and wellbeing of people many decades later. Positive health shocks during childhood can result in people being healthier later in life and thus less reliant on healthcare services or government social safety net programs. Conversely, adverse health shocks early in life might permanently decrease human capital and result in long run social costs. This project studies how childhood exposure to radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear testing and the Salk poliomyelitis vaccine trial in the 1950s have affected the health and wellbeing of aging populations. Both atmospheric nuclear testing conducted in Nevada and the Salk vaccine trial plausibly affected millions of people during the 1950s. Much of the affected populations have retired or are nearing retirement age and thus are relying more on U.S. social safety net programs. If past public health shocks affected the human and health capital of a large cohort of people, then it is plausible that these shocks are affecting the contemporary wellbeing and the costs of social safety net programs.  Using county level records estimating radioactive fallout exposure, I can link individuals to measures of exposure by birthplace and birth data. By comparing more and less exposed populations, I can quantify the health and human capital effects of both prenatal and childhood exposure to radioactive fallout. In contrast to atmospheric nuclear testing, the Salk polio vaccine trial of 1954 potentially led to long-run improvements in public health. While immunity to the poliovirus likely benefited many, it is plausible that that the trial itself may have altered public opinions and behaviors regarding healthcare investments. The project will identify individuals exposed to the vaccine trial and compare their long-run health, human capital, and program participation with persons who were not directly exposed to the vaccination trial.",7,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Joseph Ferrie,Keith A Meyers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the rapid progress of this literature, several major questions about human capital development remain unanswered (Currie & Almond, 2011). Perhaps most importantly: can economic and health interventions mitigate the damages from harmful early-life shocks? This project attempts to answer this question by examining long-term outcomes of children whose families were exposed to one of three early-life shocks in the early- or mid-20th Century. The three shocks affect children's health, healthcare access, and finally the interaction between wealth and environmental hazards. To evaluate their impacts, we will utilize records from the Decennial Censuses, the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the Social Security NUMIDENT database. The Census products provide outcome and control variables, while the Social Security files provide detailed information on date and place of birth, which is used to identify treated individuals.

Many contributors to these disparities have been documented, including discrimination, educational opportunities, and social networks. Since a greater ability to chase economic opportunity should improve anyone's labor market outcomes, an additional potential contributor to labor market disparities is differences in migration patterns. Constraints to migration can take many forms -- from social/cultural constraints to financial constraints. The first goal of this project is to assess whether a greater geographic mis-match between job opportunities and people at different education levels exists among racial and ethnic minorities than among white, non-Hispanics. We will utilize the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey, and the Decennial Census to examine this question.   The project will then investigate the degree to which these distributional differences across race/ethnicity, or mismatch, reflect differential responses to changing job opportunities. This will be done through regression analysis examining the direct relationship between job opportunities and education/race specific populations.  As far as we know, this relationship has not been explored across different demographic/education groups.  Our contribution to the existing literature lies in our efforts to document the differences in responsiveness to education/race specific job opportunities.

2283,Active,"State Variation in Intimate Partner Violence Rates, Reporting, and Healthcare Utilization",Colorado,2019,,Sarah small,"The proposed study uses the National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS) to investigate intimate partner violence victims' use of healthcare facilities and state-specific correlates associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) rates. We seek to increase the utility of Census Bureau data by analyzing the effects of healthcare access, income, employment, family, race, gender, and state-level characteristics on IPV rates and victims' healthcare facility utilization. We are particularly interested in whether state differences in healthcare professionals' reporting requirements explain meaningful variation in victims' likelihood of seeking professional medical services and overall rates of IPV victimization and reporting. Some argue that mandatory reporting is beneficial in that it helps law enforcement officers identify abusers and forces abusers to face the seriousness of their actions (Coulter & Chez, 1997). Others say mandatory reporting discourages victims from seeking medical help and robs them of their autonomy for safely reporting abuse, often putting victims further in harm's way. Many scholars (Sullivan & Hagen, 2005; Rodriguez et al., 2001; Glass et al., 2001; Gielen et al., 2000) have qualitatively studied patients' and healthcare workers' perceptions of mandatory reporting policies and found that most patients who have experienced IPV oppose these regulations. However, to our knowledge, this would be the first study that quantitatively examines the actual impacts of mandatory physician reporting laws on healthcare utilization rates of IPV victims using a quasi-experimental framework. In light of this debate, our central research questions are: (1) Do healthcare providers' mandatory reporting requirements impact the use of healthcare services for victims of IPV? And (2), do states with mandatory reporting requirements have more or less IPV per capita? In answering these questions we will also examine how police presence, proximity to care providers, local economic climate, family size, race, and gender impact the likelihood of experiencing IPV and seeking healthcare after an IPV incident. To answer these questions, we will make use of the restricted NCVS to obtain greater geographic precision about the counties and states that respondents reside in. We will prepare estimates of victim's healthcare utilization rates and IPV rates by state in light of variance in mandatory reporting laws. This will shed light on the costs and benefits of mandatory reporting and will provide a clearer insight into factors which determine healthcare utilization by IPV victims and state-level differences in IPV rates. Through our analysis of the data, we will also document the distribution of missing data related to IPV and how this missing data is related to the method of data collection to help increase the utility of the data to the Census Bureau.
There may be some concern about victimization generally, and IPV especially, constituting a sensitive topic of research. This concern is fair, though the NCVS is designed specifically to generate population estimates of victimization prevalence and the associated characteristics of victimized individuals. The present research falls within this purpose, and therefore represents a fairly routine use of these data. While we do plan to use these estimates to determine how state-level policies on mandatory reporting influence IPV reporting and medical care utilization, we are not assessing the impacts of any national policy issues or particularly current, sensitive political topics.",1,National Crime Victimization Survey,NCVS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Anita Pena,Philip Pendergast,Sarah small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our research will investigate the hypothesis that two major events - the economic crisis and the 2017 hurricanes - changed Puerto Rico residents' fertility and migration calculus, while affecting mortality in the short-term as well as over a multiple year period. In particular, we expect that the economic crisis and uncertainty after the 2017 hurricane season suppressed fertility, increased mortality in the short term and possible lowered mortality over a longer period, and increased out-migration.
We have three research aims. First, we will describe period and cohort trends in fertility, mortality and migration between 2000 and the latest year for which data are available. These components of demographic change are important for understanding how the sociodemographic characteristics of the population change, both through direct effects (birth, death, out-migration, in-migration) and indirect effects (changes in the population at risk of birth, death, and migration). Second, we will describe the residential locations of Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico or other U.S. states and territories in each year between 2000 and the latest year for which data are available.

2295,Active,"Labor Demand Shocks, Local Economic Activity, Employment Restrictions, and Criminal Behavior",Michigan,2022,,Michael G Mueller-Smith,"Congressional inquiries and Executive Order 13826 have called for improved access to data for research on job opportunities for individuals who interact with the criminal justice system. In order to study the interaction of labor markets and the criminal justice system systematically at the micro-level, researchers need detailed person-level longitudinal data on employment, earnings, and criminal justice interactions. Since sample surveys rarely have sufficient coverage to generate the necessary statistical power to study topics such as labor market outcomes by types of crimes or sanctions, employment prospects of ex-inmates in rural areas, or specific prison occupational programs, research requires the analysis of administrative records as described in this proposal. 
To address these needs, this project will integrate data for individuals on employment history and justice involvement to examine the effect of employment on offending at the individual -level. Specifically, this study will examine the relationships between labor demand shocks, kinship job loss, own job loss, conviction-based employment restrictions, and offending. Labor demand shocks lead to changes in own employment, which could impact offending resulting in employment restrictions for convicted offenders. It is then the employment restrictions that contribute to reoffending because of blocked opportunity to reenter the labor force. In addition, estimates of population characteristics will be produced for justice-involved individuals, a group that is notoriously difficult to reach.
To examine the framework described above, four Census Bureau provided data sets will be linked  with PI provided data. The four sources of Census Bureau data requested in this proposal include the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and the Census Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). CJARS is a new dataset built on administrative records that tracks arrests, charges, convictions, and participation in the correctional population in the United States.

We will focus on three main research questions: how do management and organizational practices relate to the rate and direction of entrepreneurial spinouts generated from an establishment? How do organizational practices influence the extent to which firms attract or lose employees, as well as the characteristics of employees who join and depart an establishment? How does early employees' industry experience affect the managerial practices adopted by new establishments? How long does this effect persist? Answering these research questions will contribute to the debate on the drivers of business dynamism and it should lead to a much better understanding of why it may be changing over time and what the prospects for the future are. Furthermore, the study will improve our understanding of why employees decide to found new firms, and, more broadly, the relationship between management at incumbent firms and the rate and direction of entrepreneurial activity.

At the same time, nominal and real exchange rate volatilities are large. The sensitivity of international trade to US dollar currency changes and whether the financial market understands the sensitivity are important and still-unresolved questions. In this project, we use the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) --which contains detailed transaction-level data for all importing/exporting US firms--to assess, 1.  heterogeneity in trade prices, volumes, and revenues of US exporters and importers in response to exchange rate movements and 2. whether financial markets understand this sensitivity. 
Briefly speaking, we will use LFTTD to obtain export and import volume and unit value information for each transaction. We use import/export dates in the LFTTD to match transactions to exchange rate movements from the IMF Exchange Rates data, using a weighted average of the exchange rates firms experience. To recover firm-level characteristics, we link transactions to US firms in the Longitudinal Business Database (LDB) and via the Standard Statistical Establishment List/Business Register (SSEL) and the COMPUSTAT-SSEL Bridge (CSB) to the CRSP/COMPUSTAT merged database.

2307,Active,Evaluating the Utility of SIPP Data to Examine the Increasingly Heterogeneous Foreign Born Population,Missouri,2020,,Claire Altman,"Social science research is intently focused on describing the characteristics of the increasingly diverse foreign-born population with respect to migrant status, and, if and how integration outcomes vary across status groups. However, empirical studies of immigrant integration have been hampered by a lack of nationally representative survey data of the foreign-born. The research proposed here - specifically focused on health outcomes- aims to address this data and methodological shortcoming and provide avenues for future empirical research on immigrant integration in America. To overcome data limitations, this project first makes three methodological advances by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from the US Census matched to federal administrative records. First, we will estimate the prevalence of measurement error of the foreign-born population in the SIPP by using the existence (or lack) of an administrative record match. Second, we will articulate a method for adjusting sample weights for coverage error in the SIPP that disproportionately impacts estimates of the foreign-born population. Third, we will test methods for using SIPP data in combination with other national surveys in order to impute characteristics of immigrants measured only in the SIPP in much larger surveys that lack such characteristics. The resulting methodological advances and data will be used to examine how health outcomes that are commonly used as indicators of immigrant integration (self-rated health (SRH), number of sick days during the previous 12 months, work disabling illnesses, indicators of psychological distress, health insurance coverage, and routine care) vary by migrant status. Together, the results will present vital methodological and substantive contributions to the growing migrant status literature in the social sciences and health fields. Ultimately, the purpose of this research is to provide a methodological foundation to support empirically-validated, important social and public policy analyses focused on migrant status as well as immigrant integration processes and wellbeing.",3,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Claire Altman,James D Bachmeier,Christal G Hamilton,Scott H Holan,Trang T Pham,Cody B Spence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will employ trans-log and difference-in-differences methodologies to estimate pre- and post-levels of R&D-related investments and outcomes (i.e. patent count and patent citations). First, it is hypothesized there is a differential effect on a firm's willingness to invest in innovation (i.e. log of R&D related expenditures) modulated by the firm's size (i.e. log of sales) between the pre- and post-periods. Furthermore, it is hypothesized the coefficient on the logarithm of sales is negative--the rationale for this is that larger firms will increase their reliance on smaller firms due to the former's ability to technologically ""leap-frog"" smaller rivals in the innovation process. Lastly, it is hypothesized that smaller, innovative firms (proxied by number of patents and citations) will experience an increase in their propensities to merge with larger, older firms since smaller firms are unable to devote the same resources as their larger and older rivals in subsequent patent races.",23,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs,ASE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,James O Driver,Adam Kolasinski,Jared Stanfield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know that these rates vary by age, sex, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and geography, among other factors (Cutler et al. 2006).  However, many questions have only been partially addressed because of data limitations.  For instance, causal effects of socioeconomic status on mortality remain unclear.  The association of many of these factors on death, by cause, is also limited because of the large sample size needs to assess relationships.  Therefore, we will ask several interrelated research questions to expand our knowledge of the sociodemographic predictors of US mortality.

Because mental migration is so common among AIAN people, the possible future population is much larger than usually estimated. Second, I will use the Navajo Nation Adult Voter data (NNAV; user-provided data) linked with the other data to develop population projections of Navajo people specifically. Tribal nation-specific projections can be more useful than nationwide projections. I expect Navajo rates of race response change to be lower than the overall AIAN rates and projections to show accordingly smaller variation. Third, expanding on my prior work on tribal non-response with unlinked data, I will investigate non-response to the tribe question among Navajo people.

2347,Active,"The Labor Share, Superstar Firms, and Business Cycles",Chicago,2022,,Christina Patterson,"Over the past several decades, there has been a well-documented change in the cyclical nature of the U.S. economy. Since the 1980s, the volatility of business cycle aggregates, such as GDP, unemployment and inflation, and microeconomic aggregates, such individual labor earnings, fell substantially. A second well-documented trend in the economy over the same period has been the secular fall in the labor share and the rise of superstar firms. Between 1987 and 2007, the US labor share, which is defined as the share of value-added earned by workers in the form of wages, fell substantially. The analysis in this proposal will link these two phenomena and hypothesize that the structural changes in the economy that lead to the decline in the aggregate labor share have also contributed to the Great Recession and changed the nature of U.S. business cycles. Specifically this project will be to provide population-level estimates for how this cyclical behavior of the labor market is affected by the falling labor share. In comprehensively answering these questions, this project will build a novel dataset that links together three main datasets -- the linked worker-firm earnings data in the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) files, the economic information on firm performance available in the Economic Census, and a new external dataset on establishment-level vacancies constructed by Burning Glass Technologies. The project will establish the patterns for the relative cyclicality of labor earnings at firms with different labor shares. In these regressions relating the cyclicality of the firm to its labor share, we will include controls for other features of the firm, such as size or industry, that may both be correlated with the firm's labor share and predict the firm's sensitivity to the business cycle. Using the linked worker-firm data available in the LEHD, we will also look within the firm and explore how the cyclicality of worker earnings are affected by the labor share of the firm in which they work. Using the information from job advertisements in the Burning Glass data, we will explore how the cyclical behavior of vacancy creation and posted wages are affected by the labor share of the firm. This comprehensive set of regressions will enable us to disentangle the margins along which high- and low-labor share firms differ in their labor market responses to aggregate shocks.",20,American Community Survey,ACS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Alex S Blumenfeld,Caroline M Chin,Feng Lin,Christina Patterson,Yuting Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2357,Active,Immigrant Generations Across the 20th Century,Penn State,2020,,Jennifer L Van Hook,"The population of the United States has been shaped and reshaped by multiple waves of immigration. Yet data limitations have made it difficult to assess the ways and extent to which immigrants and their families have assimilated and become integrated into mainstream U.S. society.  Of key concern is understanding how assimilation patterns have differed across national origin groups, birth cohorts, and receiving contexts. This 5-year project builds on an ongoing Census Bureau data linkage project, the Core Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), which links individuals and families across decennial censuses, CPS and ACS survey data files from 1940 to the present. The current project will leverage the CLIP data to provide unique and new information about the adaptation and integration of immigrant populations over time and across three generations from 1940 to the present. In doing so, the research seeks to better understand the ways in which the assimilation process has varied across national origin groups and across different time periods and destination contexts.

While local governments have responded through various policies, understanding of housing and labor markets at a localized level is still relatively superficial. This project will develop a rich understanding of many aspects of local housing and labor markets. Using data available through the Census RDC--in particular the LEHD--this project proposes to understand (1) how households decide where to live within a city (e.g. proximity to employers, other location-based amenities, physical characteristics of housing, and price) and (2) how real estate stock passes through different geographies and demographic groups (i.e. the ripple effects of new development via the chains of vacancies created as households move).

From 1920 through 1980, there were approximately 1,600 openings of colleges (mainly two-year colleges) in the United States;  Between 1966 and 1980, 24 states introduced public funding for kindergarten; Between 1950 and 2000 in the U.S., over 120,000 schools were eliminated through consolidation and the average school size increased from 87 to 440 students. Each of these can be taken as an education policy natural experiment. That is, depending on location and date of birth, otherwise similar people were exposed to differences in college costs, access to public kindergarten, and school size. Using data from the Census Bureau, we will estimate the causal effect of these changes in education policy on important college and life outcomes, including educational attainment, family income, spouse educational attainment, migration, one's neighborhood characteristics as an adult, occupation, self-reported health status, wealth accumulation, premature adult mortality, the incidence of chronic disease, the educational attainment and longevity of one's children, and a number of outcomes relating to Covid-19 (in particular, the impact of Covid-19 at both the level of individuals and communities).",16,American Community Survey,ACS,American Housing Survey,AHS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC Crosswalk 1940 IPUMS Research,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_1940_IPUMS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Housing Survey (AHS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_AHS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,CMS Medicare Enrollment Database (EDB),CMS_EDB,1940 IPUMS Research,COMM_1940_IPUMS_RESEARCH,Census IPUMS Research,COMM_CENSUS_IPUMS_RESEARCH,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Kevin Connolly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will aim to provide a causal explanation for the counter-cyclical behavior of basic research observed in aggregate data. Its findings will also be used to reassess the effect of short-term economic fluctuations on technological development and growth. To do that, we will combine Census data from BRDIS, SIRD, LBD, and QFR, with data we provide from Compustat, and USPTO. We will impute for no-response using multiple imputations, test for causal connections using regression, and investigate macroeconomic dynamics by calibrating a novel endogenous growth model.

Our hypothesis is that weak demands induce firms to shift from launching new products, through applied research, to building ability to innovate, through basic research. Empirically, we expect to find that, controlling for confounders, there is a negative correlation between a firm investment in basic research and the predicted demand for its new products. Also, we expect the data to validate our novel endogenous growth model that implies that downturns are followed by rapid technological innovation. The project may contribute to the literature by providing evidence that downturns are beneficial for future technological development and growth, in stark contrast with the dominant view that assets that they are inimical to both.

2371,Active,Improving the Efficiency of Model-Informed Decision-making in Responsive and Adaptive Survey Designs,Michigan,2021,,James R Wagner,"Sample surveys are a critical resource for social science and health research. Large-scale national surveys, such as the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) and the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), are essential for understanding the population. However, sample surveys are increasingly facing the dual pressure of rising nonresponse and shrinking budgets. This pressure threatens the quality of survey estimates.

Survey methodologists have responded to these pressures by proposing two new classes of designs which are aimed at increasing quality or controlling costs. The first new class of designs, known as responsive survey designs, uses incoming data from the field to trigger changes in the design. In effect, these responsive designs identify cases that are not responding well under the current protocol, and offering them a new protocol that is more likely to induce response. The second class of designs is known as adaptive survey design. These designs attempt to identify subgroups in the population for whom different designs may be more effective. The goal is to identify the optimal design, with respect to a stated objective, that is tailored to individuals--i.e., assigns different designs to subgroups. Both classes of designs rely upon inputs for decision-making. Often, these inputs are in the form of model predictions about the probability of response. Unfortunately, the quality of those inputs has not been evaluated in either of these new classes of survey designs. We propose to evaluate the quality of these inputs. In particular, we will evaluate the impact of model selection procedures on the effectiveness of responsive and adaptive survey designs.

We will use data from the largest ongoing survey in the U.S., the American Community Survey (ACS), to accelerate progress on evaluating different approaches to informing the data collection design. The ACS is a mandatory survey with a 95% response rate that also uses a phased design with multiple protocols,
making it ideal for this study. We will vary both the information being used to direct data collection at the sample case level, and the primary objective of the targeted use of more costly methods ",14,American Community Survey,ACS,American Community Survey Paradata,ACSP,Decennial Census,CEN,Commercial DAR Partners,COMM_DAR_PARTNERS,Commercial Experian End-Dated Records (EDR),COMM_EXP_EDR,Commercial Experian Insource (INSRC),COMM_EXP_INSRC,Commercial Infogroup,COMM_INFOGROUP,Commercial Melissa Data Base,COMM_MELISSA,Commercial Targus National Address File (NAF),COMM_TARGUS_ADDRESS,Commercial Targus Federal Consumer,COMM_TARGUS_FEDCONSUMER,Commercial Targus Pure Wireless,COMM_TARGUS_WIRELESS,Commercial VSGI Consumer Referential Database,COMM_VSGI_CRD,Commercial VSGI Tracker (TRK),COMM_VSGI_TRK,Planning Database (PDB),PDB_PUBLIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,James R Wagner,Xinyu Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2377,Active,"Flood Risk, Migration, and Policy: Evidence from U.S. Households",Kentucky,2022,,Lala Ma,"Floods trigger monumental losses across the US that are projected to increase with climate change. With the recent history of unprecedented flood losses from events including Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey, growing concern surrounds the detrimental consequences for some of the nation's most vulnerable communities. These distributional concerns are not new. Critically, little is known about how households may heterogeneously adjust to flood risk along several key housing margins including location choice and the decision to rent versus own, as well as how these decisions may be impacted by public welfare programs. The project will provide insight into these flooding issues through two empirical papers carefully motivated by theory. Both papers use data from the American Community Survey (2000-2023, as available).  Paper 1 applies a residential sorting model to data on recent movers in major metropolitan areas within the US to analyze the extent to which homebuyers and renters heterogeneously sort across flood risk based on their race/ethnicity, income, and educational attainment. These results will then be used to estimate the impacts of the National Flood Insurance Program and changes in flood risk on intra-US migration decisions and the resulting distribution of socioeconomic groups across flood risk in the US. Paper 2 examines how serious flood events affect migration decisions (e.g. whether, and where, to move within the US, and whether to rent versus buy) and mortgage impacts, and if participation in social insurance programs modifies the responses to flood-related natural disasters.

2387,Active,Understanding Factors Affecting the Ability of Older Workers to Participate in the Labor Force: Employer Concentration and Employer Demand,Boston,2021,,Gal Wettstein,"Longer lives, the shift to defined contribution (DC) plans, and lower Social Security replacement rates mean Americans need to work longer to secure an adequate retirement. This project analyzes the ability of older workers to find employment in an environment where longer careers are likely to be necessary but where increasing firm concentration and a lack of demand from employers threaten their ability to do so. First, the project examines the relationship between employer concentration and labor force participation (LFP) for workers at various ages. To establish the mechanisms involved in this association, the project will test for heterogeneity in the correlation of concentration and LFP by two dimensions: education and unionization.  In both cases, the effect of concentration is expected to be smaller for workers with more bargaining power, such as the more educated and the unionized. Second, the project explores whether older workers are good for firms' productivity and profitability. The project will estimate the firm-level correlation of the share of workers over age 55 and the productivity of the firm, as measured by revenue per worker, the ratio of revenue to wages, and for the manufacturing sector total factor productivity and whether production targets were met.

2389,Active,"Wages, Worker Productivity, and Imperfect Competition in the U.S. Labor Market",Boston,2020,,Samuel G Young,"Recently, there has been considerable interest in how closely workers' pay is tied to their productivity. One motivation for this discussion is the fact that median US worker pay growth has been far weaker than the growth of GDP per worker (labor productivity) since the mid-1970s. In
the decades prior to this, productivity and pay growth followed each other quite closely. Research has shown that the competitive model of wage setting is inconsistent with many parts of the labor market, and critical questions remain. How has the relationship between productivity and wages changed over time? Is the imperfect pass-through of productivity to wages driven by monopoly power in the product market, monopsony power in the labor market, adjustment frictions, and/or other factors? What firm and labor market characteristics are associated with firms paying workers close to their productivity?

This project will improve measurement of the relationship between workers' productivity and their pay, and explore heterogeneity in these measures across time, firms, and labor market conditions. The analysis will add to our understanding of why firms can pay workers less than their productivity and what types of firms pay workers closer to their productivity. The main project uses production function estimation techniques to measure the degree of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market, and will estimate this measure across a large number of firms over multiple decades. We can estimate the wedge between workers' marginal revenue product and their wage. Then using another input into the production function (e.g. materials), we can separate how much of this wedge is due to monopoly power in the product market vs. monopsony power in the labor market. Under a model of wage posting with monopsony power, this measure directly identifies a time-varying elasticity of labor supply faced by each firm. As a supplement to this new measure of imperfect competition, we also plan on estimating standard rent-sharing elasticities that measure how exogenous shocks to worker productivity pass through to their wages.

While there are existing estimates of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market, most of the empirical evidence on this topic is not directly tied to theories of wage setting and/or are focused on very specific occupational labor markets (so lack enough external validity for the general U.S. labor market). We propose to estimate two theoretically motivated measures of imperfect competition across a large number of firms and over time. Both measures estimate how worker productivity changes pass through to their wages. The first relies on production function estimation and is similar to how IO economists measure markups. The second is a rent-sharing method familiar to labor economists. With estimates of both measures for an overlapping set of firms, we can compare the two different measures, analyze heterogeneity across firms and labor markets, and document how these measures have changed over the past 25-40 years.",32,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Business Expenditures Survey,BES,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - No Revenue,LBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey,MECS,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,National Employer Survey,NES,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,John M Van Reenen,Sean Y Wang,Michael B Wong,Samuel G Young,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2391,Completed,The Impact of Financing Constraints on Trade: Evidence from US Firm-Level Data,Colorado,2021,2022.0,Danny Kurban,"Economic theory suggests that trading firms should be particularly dependent on external and internal financing due to issues such as long shipment lags, currency and regulatory risks, and high initial fixed costs to set up a distribution network abroad. This implies that firms with tighter credit constraints should be significantly less likely to export to a given destination (extensive margin) and have significantly lower export shares (intensive margin) than comparable, but financially unconstrained, firms. However, existing strategies fail to document how financial constraints determine trade shares because they lack firm-level microdata.

2403,Active,"Cross-Neighborhood Mobility and Implications for Understanding Cities, Neighborhoods, and the Effectiveness of Place-Based Policies",Philadelphia,2020,,Evan Mast,"Geographic mobility plays an important role in many economic issues, and thus mobility across metropolitan areas, states, and countries has been widely studied. Recent research increasingly suggests that mobility across neighborhoods is also important, for example in determining the effectiveness of place-based revitalization programs (Busso, Gregory, and Kline 2013) and influencing the long-term educational attainment and earnings of children (Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016; Chetty and Hendren 2018a,b; Chyn 2018). Yet despite this importance, studying cross-neighborhood mobility and its implications for individual outcomes has been challenging because of data limitations. This project combines data from the Census 2000 and 2010, American Community Surveys 2005-2018, and Master Address File (MAF) to obtain longitudinal individual observations with detailed location information, demographic characteristics, and outcomes. We first explore how different types of individuals move across different types of neighborhoods and how these mobility patterns shape individuals' longitudinal exposure to neighborhood characteristics such as poverty and segregation. We expect that mobility will lead to exposure measures that differ from measures using cross-sectional data. We then study the role of individual mobility in neighborhood change, and we expect this will reveal that neighborhoods are more dynamic than usually assumed. Finally, we use these data to study the effectiveness of place-based treatments for incumbent and future residents. Overall, our results will improve understanding of cross-neighborhood mobility, gentrification and neighborhood decline, and the effectiveness and distributional consequences of place-based treatments.",14,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Commercial Black Knight Assessment Data (ASMT),COMM_BLACKKNIGHT_ASMT,Commercial CoreLogic Buildings,COMM_CORELOGIC_BLDGS,Commercial CoreLogic Property Deeds,COMM_CORELOGIC_DEED,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,HUD Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS),HUD-TRACS,HUD Public and Indian Housing Information Center (PIC),HUD_PIC,HUD PIC and TRACS Longitudinal,HUD_PICTRACS_LNGTDNL,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,POP_TABLES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,Alaina G Barca,Nathaniel Baum-Snow,Eric T Chyn,Robert Collinson,Daniel A Hartley,Evan Mast,Davin Reed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LEHD model for establishment assignments contributes to workplace tabulations of jobs for several public use data products. We would supplement the LEHD administrative data with survey responses of workplace location from the 2000 Decennial Census long form and the American Community Survey. We would link survey respondents to LEHD jobs and, for each job, try to identify an establishment that agrees with the surveyed workplace location, in order to assemble a survey-based match set. With wide coverage over geography and time, we would use the match set to evaluate the quality of the LEHD establishment assignments. We would also evaluate the assignments in a banking industry context for cases of establishment non-response and employer restructuring. In addition, we would use LEHD, the surveys, the match set, as well as the Small Business Lending Survey to study role of workers in banking. The banking industry has undergone extensive consolidation and technological change in recent decades, so understanding the effects of bank acquisitions on workers and the role of specialized worker knowledge on bank operations and performance would help to explain both the rationale for, and consequences of, these structural changes. Specifically, we would estimate models to explain the effect of acquisitions on workers at the target bank, both immediately and in the long term, which would provide evidence of how banks value human capital. We would also use bank-by-market level variation due to acquisitions, as well as other industry changes, to examine whether bank workers' human capital or market specific knowledge plays a role in the services a bank provides to a market and the bank's performance in that market.",13,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,FDIC Small Business Lending Survey - Preliminary Data,SBLS_FDIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Joseph W Kinsella,Mark J Kutzbach,Smith Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Were there long-term consequences for women who entered the workforce and for their children? In order to address these questions, I make use of the Census Numident File combined with the 1940 Census to construct a novel intercensal measure of labor force entry--SSN first issuance--for the wives of draft-eligible men. After linking these data to the WWII Enlistment Records, I exploit the draft lottery to construct an individual-level instrument for married women's workforce entry. In doing so, I can disentangle the supply and demand-side drivers of female labor supply during WWII--the former being proxied by government spending by town--conditional on a rich set of covariates. Furthermore, I plan to leverage the longitudinal structure of PIK-ed mandatory surveys to assess the long-term consequences of female entry. Specifically, by using reduced form evidence and instrumental variable techniques, I intend to assess whether being a working woman increased the likelihood of divorce and whether the outcomes of children of working mothers differed substantially from those of non-working mothers. In order to address identification concerns, I plan to extend the analysis to elicit random variation in the entry of female neighbors.

2428,Active,Housing Unit Rental Rates and Unit Quality,USC,2021,,Evgeny Burinskiy,"Preliminary work with data from American Housing Survey (AHS) PUF sample suggests that the difference between low- and high-quality housing units in some metropolitan areas is small.  With these results as our motivating base, we aim to use housing and occupant  data from American Housing  Survey  IUF  samples  to  conduct  a  more  rigorous  assessment  of  the  quality-to-rent relationship and test two hypotheses that may explain variations in the relationship. First, using the more precise geographical coding of IUF micro-data, we incorporate important spatial unit characteristics and Census demographic data into the hedonic equation that estimates the rent-to-quality schedules.  Using  these  estimates  of  the  relationship,  our  first  hypothesis  examines  the extent to which rental and ownership markets compete. We suspect competition may exist in cities with  more  accessible  ownership  markets  since  landlords  catering  to  renters on  the  margin  of buying a home may have smaller pricing power which results in lower relative rents. Conversely, metros in which the housing market is more expensive, even higher-income households may not have the capacity to enter the owning market so landlords catering to them have more pricing power; hence, higher relative rents. The second hypothesis we examine stems from evidence of potential landlord monopoly power in select neighborhoods. Chiefly, we estimate whether rents in neighborhoods with highly-concentrated unit portfolios are higher than they otherwise should be using  a  hedonic  between  IUF  rents  and  market  concentration  indexes.  To  estimate  market concentrations,  we  utilize  official  tax  and  property  assessor  databases  on  property  ownership. Because  we  presently have  access  to  assessor  databases  for Milwaukee  City and  Los  Angeles County, we perform market concentration analysis in these areas but will expand to other cities or metropolitan areas as more assessor data become available.",1,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Evgeny Burinskiy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A deficit of high-quality accessible data impedes the study and development of evidence-based policies in the civil justice arena, and will cripple evidence building and policy responses during pandemic recovery unless more knowledge is created.  This project develops methods to produce statistics characterizing parties involved in civil court eviction cases, noting how they differ across sites and over time.

The project addresses knowledge and data gaps about the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of court participants.  Such data are not collected in the civil courts themselves, unlike the situation in criminal courts where more information about defendants (e.g., age or date of birth, race and ethnicity) is captured. For civil cases, even if courts were to begin collecting these characteristics regularly, the data would not be comprehensive or representative because 40 percent of defendants in evictions cases do not show up for their court hearings.

We intend to use researcher-provided-data from 9 sites with demographic and geographic characteristics in this project.

2441,Active,"Innovation, Concentration, and Growth",Chicago,2020,,Chang-Tai Hsieh,"This project will use the Economic Censuses (EC), the Business R&D Surveys (SIRD, BRDIS and the ABS), the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD), and the Revenue-Enhanced Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to provide new series that shed light on two questions.   First, what are the sources of innovation?  What is the role of creative destruction, innovation on a firm's own products, and creation of new products?  How important is access to foreign markets for each type of innovation?  Second, what are the effects of top firm concentration on innovation, aggregate growth, and the spatial distribution of economic activity?

This project builds upon the work the researchers completed in their previous Census RDC projects.  In these projects, the researchers tackled two questions.  First, how do we measure the efficiency of resource allocation across firms for a given distribution of underlying firm productivity?  Second, what are the mechanisms behind the changes in the distribution of firm productivity over time?  How much of the growth in firm productivity takes the form of creative destruction, innovation on the firm's own products, and the creation of brand new products?  

In the current proposal, the researchers plan to address two questions.  First, the researchers will address three limitations of the previous census project.  In the previous project, the researchers inferred the contribution of each type of innovation from the distribution of job flows.  The researchers did not directly observe each type of innovation, but rather inferred the frequency of each type of innovation from the distribution of job creation and job destruction.  The researchers also assumed that the size of quality improvements was the same for creative destruction and own innovation.  A third limitation was that the researchers assumed innovations only built on the products owned by domestic firms.  In the proposed research project, the researchers will directly measure the frequency and improvement in quality from each type of innovation based on the business R&D surveys (ABS-BRDIS-SIRD).  In addition, the researchers will measure the contribution of access to foreign markets to innovation by merging the LFTTD with the LBD and EC.

A second objective of this research proposal is to measure the effect of the growing concentration of sales at top firms.  The researchers believe that growing firm concentration could be the consequence of new technologies that enable top firms to expand.  The researchers plan to examine this hypothesis by measuring the following moments.  First, the researchers will decompose the growth of top firms in an industry into the contribution of expansion into new product lines or markets.  Second, the researchers will measure industry productivity growth in sectors where top firm concentration has increased.  Third, the researchers will measure changes in the share of payments to labor in industry sales, and their correlation with the change in the market share of top firms in the sector.  Fourth, the researchers will measure changes in the market share of top national firms in local markets (defined as an MSA or a county), and the extent of local labor productivity growth in each local market.  Finally, the researchers will examine the correlation of job destruction with the change in the market share of top national firms in the sector.

However, while development has produced a mix of diffuse economic benefits, it also raises concerns about locally-concentrated health risks and environmental justice (EJ) issues.

2459,Active,Employees in the U.S. Non-profit Sector,Michigan,2021,,Stephanie Karol,"Despite the fact that the non-profit sector employs roughly 10% of the American workforce, making it the third largest workforce behind retail and manufacturing, relatively little is known about its employees. Indeed, very few studies conduct a detailed analysis of a particular sector. Those that do consider a narrower subset of workers, are mainly concerned with public sector workers, and do not focus exclusively on charity employees. This project will be the first to use administrative data to paint a picture of the U.S. non-profit sector, and answer important questions such as who works in the non-profit sector, and how do shocks and government policies affect its employees.

Up until now, researchers have used survey data to focus on the motivation of non-profit workers, and how their behavior differs from for-profit workers. Using British panel data, Gregg et al. (2011) show that non-profit workers are more likely to donate their labor (as measured by unpaid overtime), than their for-profit counterparts. In the U.S. context, Houston (2000, 2006) finds that public employees place a higher value on intrinsic reward, and government employees are more likely to volunteer for charities and donate blood than for-profit employees. However, they found no difference among public service and private employees in terms of individual philanthropy. This is in contrast to Buurman et al (2012), who conclude from a Dutch survey that public sector employees contribute less to charity because they feel that they contribute enough to society at work for too little pay.

Therefore, although we know something about the motivations of charity employees, we know very little about their basic demographics, how they interact with the charity labor market, and how they move between the for- and non-profit sectors. Furthermore, understanding how organization-level shocks affect charity employees, and how government policies affect non-profit employment decisions will add to our knowledge of the charity labor market and contribute to the policy debate over the benefits of public versus private provision of services.

The use of administrative data is crucial in our setting; the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) is the only data source that allows us to focus on the employer-employee relationship in the United States. Using the LEHD also provides several benefits over using survey data, such as larger sample sizes and avoiding concerns about non-random measurement error. Indeed, previous studies have found the size of the non-profit sector to be misrepresented in surveys (Millard and Machin, 2007).",8,American Community Survey,ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Ashley Craig,Olivia Edwards,Stephanie Karol,Jennifer Mayo,Jonathan Meer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we will estimate empirical models that project R&D characteristics on measures of firm size. Using unique innovation information from the BRDIS and product-level sales from the CMF, we will extend our empirical analysis to innovation by type: internal (towards market areas the firm is already active in) and external (towards market areas new to the firm).

I use the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) to study the 2014 introduction of ""Pre-K For All"" in New York City, a universal pre-K (UPK) policy that increased the city's capacity of full-day, public preschool seats for 4 year olds from around 20,000 in 2013 to approximately 70,000 in 2015. To identify the causal effect of the UPK offer on mothers' labor force participation and hours worked, I use a difference-in-differences (DID) research design that leverages age and residency eligibility requirements to construct two different comparison groups of mothers: Mothers of same-aged children in nearby New Jersey, and mothers of slightly older children that reside in NYC.

It has been documented that when urban areas are carved up into small, independent governmental jurisdictions, those areas tend to have greater racial, ethnic and economic segregation, more urban sprawl, and lower job growth. Some evidence indicates that the fragmentation of urban space in other ways, such as through the creation of gated communities, may also generate inequality. For example, gated communities may encourage resource hoarding and undermine political will to engage in regional problem-solving efforts, both of which impose disproportionate burdens on residents of nearby low-income neighborhoods. This project will empirically investigate the effects of gated communities on socioeconomic inequality. Our primary goal is to contribute to knowledge about whether and how residential gating affects the life chances of low-income individuals living in the surrounding area.

To answer these questions, the PI's will use a novel combination of rich longitudinal data and quasi-experimental research designs. At the core of the analysis are researcher-provided eviction court case histories, which will be linked to information on socio-economic outcomes for defendants in eviction court, their family members, and any non-family cohabitants.

2477,Active,Estimating the Impact of Labor Market Concentration and Health Care Costs on the Generosity of Health Plan Benefits Offered by Employers,Maryland,2021,,Matthew Eisenberg,"Employee contributions to health plan premiums and less generous forms of health insurance have both increased in prevalence in recent years in the employer-sponsored health insurance market. Given these trends and the related impact to the financial well-being of individuals, this research project seeks to understand potential drivers of less generous forms of health coverage in employer-sponsored health insurance markets. The research objectives of the project are to investigate the effect of 1) labor market concentration and 2) rising health care costs on health plan benefits offered by employers using Census-provided data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance/Employer Component (MEPS-IC), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), and the Census of Manufacturers (CMF) for the years 2001-2023, as available. We hypothesize that both higher labor market concentration and higher health care costs lead to less generous health benefit offerings in the employer-sponsored health insurance market.

The key outcome variables for both sets of analyses will be health plan characteristics computed at the establishment level based on MEPS-IC data (e.g., average employee share of health plan premium). Labor market concentration will be measured at the county-industry-year level based on the LBD data. Local health care costs will be measured based on the average plan premium cost at the county-year level using the MEPS-IC data. 

We will estimate the effects of these independent variables on plan benefit characteristics through regression analysis of establishment level data, controlling for establishment and market level covariates, as well as county and industry-year fixed effects. Establishment level covariates will include measures available from MEPS-IC (e.g., total part-time employees) and productivity measures available for a subset of manufacturing firms from the ASM and CMF data. To account for any unobserved market specific time varying factors that may bias our population estimates, we will use the labor market concentration of neighboring counties and state level malpractice payment rates to instrument for labor market concentration and health care costs, respectively.",4,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Mark Meiselbach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas prior studies focus on the firm-level life cycle, the proposed study will be the first study to focus on the establishment-level life cycle. Specifically, we will investigate whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower for multi-unit firms whose units are in different life-cycle stages than those whose units are in the same life-cycle stage. The expected findings will suggest that the forecasting difficulty of more diversified firms can be attributed to the different life-cycle stages of each establishment. Additionally, for firms whose units are in the same stage, we will examine whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower if all the units are in earlier stages than if all the units are in later stages. Also, for firms whose units are in different stages, we will examine whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower if the units in earlier stages are larger (i.e., generates more revenue) than the units in later stages. To estimate the establishment-level life-cycle stages, we will use the Census data (CMF) at the establishment level. As a comparison, we will also estimate the life-cycle stages using firms' segment classifications in their 10-K filings. For the additional analyses, we will investigate the industry dynamics associated with life-cycle stages.",6,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Sudipta Basu,Xin Dai,Caroline Lee,Yue Qiu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, are younger and smaller firms more responsive to monetary shocks? There is a strand of literature that measures the effect of monetary shocks on the aggregate economic activity including employment. However, little is known about the disproportionate effect of monetary shocks on the employment of different firm groups. This project aims at providing new evidence on the distributional effect of monetary shocks on firm dynamics. It intends to examine heterogeneous responses of firms to monetary shocks and the propagation mechanism of monetary shocks to employment through financial frictions. It is important because the effective usage of monetary tools to promote maximum employment depends on the understanding of monetary transmission to household spending, business investment, production, employment, and inflation in the United States.

2485,Active,The Relationship Between Neighborhood Abandonment and New Urbanist Environments,Texas,2021,,Ryun Jung Lee,"For urban planners and designers, New Urbanism has been a principle approach in promoting a sense of community and walkability. The principles of New Urbanism primarily deal with urban form and design aspects; however, what is typically lacking are social aspects in urban communities. A notable and arguable aspect of New Urbanism is the assumption of economic stability and population growth. In recent years, the assumption that cities must inevitably grow has been criticized as many cities rather experienced urban decline. How New Urbanist communities mitigate or respond to neighborhood abandonment and physical disorders is still understudied. 

To fill the gap in the New Urbanism literature, our project uses the American Housing Survey and the American Community Survey from 2009-2018 to investigate four sub-studies examining the relationship between the New Urbanist environment and neighborhood abandonment. Study 1 examines if communities with New Urbanist features are more resilient to abandonment than are other communities. Study 2 examines if New Urbanist features can mitigate or predict neighborhood disorders. Study 3 compares the effects of the New Urbanist environment on neighborhood abandonment across growing, shrinking, and stable metro areas. Study 4 examines the role of the New Urbanist features in the relationship between neighborhood change and abandonment at the neighborhood level.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Ryun Jung Lee,Michelle C Stanley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use successive panels from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked to the Detailed Earnings Record (DER), the Numident, and Census Household Composition Key datasets to study how the transition to parenthood shapes within and between household economic inequalities. We use couple-level fixed effects regression models to study how coupled men's and women's earnings change with the transition to parenthood (and how these changes have evolved since the 1980s across different socioeconomic groups) and we use log-linear models and simulation/decomposition methods to study how the economic consequences of parenthood shape family income inequality. These questions represent critical gaps in the literature on gender, work, and family that limit our understanding of how family decision-making is shaped by changing norms and institutions and in turn how these processes play into increasing income inequality across households. We expect that the economic consequences of parenthood have declined most rapidly for highly skilled women, who have most incentives to stay attached to the labor force after parenthood, and that those changes might have contributed to exacerbate income inequality across households.",5,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,SSA Detailed Earnings Record (DER) SIPP Extract,SSA_DER_SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Pilar Gonalons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2489,Active,The Role of Mothers on Social Mobility of Sons and Assortative Mating in the United States,Yale,2021,,Jose-Antonio Espin-Sanchez,"There is growing interest in inequality and social mobility in the United States. However, most of these studies share one important limitation: they analyze almost exclusively the role of men in social mobility. This is because of the general lack of data on women's socioeconomic status (SES), such as income or occupation. We propose a methodology allowing researchers to calculate the transmission of social status from and to women without directly observing it, by using information from various (male) relatives. Moreover, discussing the role of women in social mobility naturally leads to consideration of the role of assortative mating. This can be a powerful source of social immobility, and so studying intergenerational status transmission and assortative mating together can yield new insights.

The standard model in social mobility implicitly assumes that only the father's SES affects the son's SES. We consider a simple extension to that model and consider that both the father's and the mother's SES affects the son's SES. In the absence of information about the SES of women, the only empirical estimate available is the correlation between the father's and son's SESs. Even if we were only interested in the direct effect of the father, we cannot get a consistent estimate if we only have information on the father and the son. We propose a new empirical methodology that allows us to estimate transmission from both men and women, as well as assortative mating, by using data on other male relatives through the maternal line.  Using linked family trees, we can estimate these parameters using a General Method of Moments methodology.",11,American Housing Survey,AHS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC Crosswalk 1940 IPUMS Research,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_1940_IPUMS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Housing Survey (AHS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_AHS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,1940 IPUMS Research,COMM_1940_IPUMS_RESEARCH,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Jose-Antonio Espin-Sanchez,Joseph Ferrie,Christopher Vickers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will exploit variation across cohorts and counties in policy and economic shocks to explore two respective questions: (1) What are the later-life impacts of public investments in universal early education, and how do they vary by local characteristics at likely time of exposure? (2) How do educational choices respond to local labor market conditions during one's teenage years, both in the short- and long-term? 

To address these questions, we will link internal demographic Census data to cohort-by-place-of-birth varying measures of exposure to universal early education (spanning the 1960s to the 1990s) and local economic circumstances stemming from the highly localized spread of fracking in the 2000s. We will also merge in data at the state, county, state-by-cohort, or county-by-cohort level as necessary to implement and test the robustness of our proposed research designs.

In particular, we estimate the average intend-to-treat effect of exposure to WIC that lasts for different periods of time and starts at different times during one's childhood, such as in-utero, in the first year of life or later, in the third-fifth year of life, etc. For this purpose, we combine data on adult outcomes of children born in the 1970s from the American Community Survey and 2000 Decennial with our data on WIC timing and geographical spread across counties and use a difference-in-differences research design.

By linking young adults in the American Community Surveys and the National Surveys of College Graduates to themselves and their parents in the Decennial Censuses, we propose to study how family background and local economic conditions influence these behavioral margins. We expect that the children of wealthier households are more likely to pursue high-earning majors/degrees while accruing less student loan debt. Individuals may respond to adverse local economic shocks by pursuing more schooling and more generally applicable majors.

Doing so will substantially enrich the PSID with measures of housing and neighborhood conditions, thereby allowing achievement of the broader goal of the more robust examination of the role of assisted housing in children's developmental outcomes than has been possible to date. Outcomes of interest are three aspects of healthy development--cognitive development, social-emotional development and several dimensions of health such as psychological distress. There are three main hypotheses to explain assisted housing effects: improved housing affordability, improved housing conditions, and improved neighborhood conditions. The PSID-AHD allows us (and other analysts) to follow a nationally representative sample of children younger than 18 who lived in assisted housing into adulthood and compare their outcomes to similar children who were eligible for but did not live in assisted housing.",1,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Charles S Holupka,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2508,Active,Skill Mismatch and the Countercyclicality of the College Quality Premium,Wisconsin,2020,,Lois Miller,"Several papers in the economics literature have documented large and persistent effects associated with graduating into a recession. However, comparatively less is known about how these effects vary over college quality. If these negative effects are disproportionately concentrated among individuals graduating from worse schools, then this heterogeneity may have important implications for income inequality and mobility. By using data on college attended and time of graduation in the restricted-use National Surveys of Graduates, we propose to study how the returns to higher-quality colleges vary over the business cycle. We expect that the earnings and employment premia associated with higher college quality increase during economic downturns, with potential drivers of this result including graduates of higher-quality colleges being more able to find jobs that match well with their skills or being more willing to move to better labor markets. These results may have important policy implications and will further our understanding of socioeconomic mobility and inequality in the United States.",1,National Survey of College Graduates,NSCG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Garrett Anstreicher,Lois Miller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2511,Active,"Private Equity Long-Term Outcomes: A Study Examining Firm Productivity, Employment and Worker Wages",Boston,2021,,Gordon M Phillips,"This project will examine the long-term changes to productivity, employment and worker wages of firms that are acquired by private equity. The central contribution of this project will be to examine how and why ownership by both private owners and by public shareholders along with real and financial factors impacts public and private (both private equity and non-private equity) firms differently in their growth, productivity, and employment over time. We examine the impact of real and financial factors to initial acquisition decisions by comparing the participation of public and private firms in merger waves and their outcomes.  We will then track productivity, employment and worker wages over time. Using plant-level data on a sample of firms over the 1963 period to the present period, we will examine the long term outcomes over five to ten years subsequent to buyouts and purchases by private equity firms and compare these to the same outcomes for firms that are publicly traded. We also will investigate the outcomes and employment of workers based on their personal credit to examine how workers fare after separation from private equity backed firms.

We will also investigate whether the financial resources along with innovative activity in the  industry and by the firm, measured by industry R&D and the number and significance of patents, affect the firm's choice to be privately (with private equity backing and without private equity backing) or publicly held. Such an effect might arise for several reasons. First, growth of seasoned firms and also exploitation of innovations might require external financing. External financing needs of individual firms will also depend on industry characteristics and stage in the industry life-cycle. Thus, they will be a function of aggregate industry investment relative to aggregate cash generated. Second, the exploitation of growth and technological opportunities may require different amount of monitoring by investors, and hence might affect the organizational form of the business --- private firm or a public firm (a division of a public firm or a stand-alone public firm), holding the need for external funds constant.

In light of recent events pertaining to the COVID-19 crisis, we further plan to understand how large and small private equity owned businesses and non-private equity owned firms (both privately held and publicly traded) have fared along with their employees. We will extend the project to examine these business - both private equity owned, non-public non private equity and publicly traded firms - over the COVID-19 to study the effects of liquidity and demand shocks on labor outcomes and business outcomes (including subsequent earnings, hiring patterns, innovation, IPOs, and mergers), and credit outcomes (bankruptcies, foreclosure, student loan default, etc.), as well as feedback effects to the general macroeconomy.",35,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,American Community Survey,ACS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC PIK Crosswalk Transunion Credit File,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_TU,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Transunion Credit File,COMM_TU,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data PIK Crosswalk,IP_INVENTOR_CROSSWALK,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Department of the Treasury State Small Business Credit Initiative,SSBCI,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Jianqiu Bai,Kyle F Herkenhoff,Markus Lithell,Gordon M Phillips,Chenqi Zhu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2512,Active,Factors Associated with Establishment Export Performance and the Spatial Dimension of Knowledge Management,Penn State,2021,,Stephan Goetz,"This project will assess the value of constructs such as innovation to understand the role of U.S businesses in the international economy and to compare the correspondence between administrative export data and self-reports of export performance.  Preliminary research using the 2014 Rural Establishment Innovation Survey--covering all establishments in tradable industries with 5 or more employees in both metro and nonmetro areas--provides suggestive evidence of the importance of innovation, intellectual property, and skilled labor to the ability of firms to successfully penetrate export markets (Wojan 2019).  Linking REIS to the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) may support more definitive analysis of the association between establishment and local area characteristics and export performance if the self-reported and qualitative assessment of exporting success generally comport with observed export activity from administrative data. The LFTTD will also make it possible to track export performance through time to identify business characteristics associated with entering export markets since 2014. Isolating the factors associated with better export performance can inform: 1) government policy with the objective of improving the balance of trade; 2) the value of collecting data on these factors; and 3) the value of administrative data in facilitating export performance analysis while minimizing respondent burden. A critical complement to the export performance research is the analysis of differences in the knowledge management strategies of exporting and non-exporting establishments.  Despite incredible advances in information and communication technologies, and new platforms for networking and sharing knowledge, the bulk of research examining the transfer of knowledge between firms focuses on the potential benefits of localization. REIS provides unique data on the location of important sources of information and knowledge for respondent businesses.  Preliminary research has demonstrated that the knowledge management strategies of metro and nonmetro firms are different, reflecting differences in the richness of local networks (Dotzel and Faggian 2019).  Linking REIS to the LFTTD and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) will allow assessing the potential performance advantages in terms of export, employment, and wage growth. This exercise will also inform the value of adding questions to the Annual Business Survey that in 2018 asked about the domestic or international status of cooperators in innovation activities but not their proximity to the firm.",7,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs,ASE,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,USDA Rural Establishment Innovation Survey (REIS),USDA_REIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Luyi Han,Zheng Tian,Timothy Wojan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2517,Active,American Communities Project,Baruch,2020,,John R Logan,"This project has four main components.  In one component, newly available linkages between census records in different years will be used to study two dimensions of neighborhood change: changes in relative income levels (such as gentrification and community impoverishment) and in racial/ethnic composition (such as increasing or declining diversity). The general approach using data from 2000 and 2010 is to identify the location of very person enumerated in either decennial census in each year, then analyze the composition of movers and stayers. The same database will also be used to study selective mobility into and out of neighborhoods at the individual level. The second component is to improve the estimation of tract characteristics in a given year within the boundaries of tracts as they were defined in a later year. Confidential census data sets identify people's census tract location based on the tract boundaries at the time of enumeration, but they also provide information that can be used to place them in other boundaries. This project will develop estimates for tract characteristics in 1950-2000 within 2010 tract boundaries, then extend the estimates to 2020 tract boundaries. The third component seeks to improve estimates of segregation of people across census tracts in terms of social characteristics such as education and occupational standing, similar to recent studies of income segregation.  These measures are susceptible to systematic bias associated with sample size and weighting, and the analysis will introduce methods of bias correction in order to evaluate change over time accurately.  The fourth component is small area estimation (SAE) for characteristics of individual census tracts.  We will examine Bayesian SAE models to increase reliability of point estimates of various population characteristics at the census tract scale that are based on sample data. The result will be an improved understanding of issues of sampling variability at the tract scale, methods for improving estimates, and disclosure of alternative estimates for a select set of variables.",8,Address Control FIle,ACF,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,POP_TABLES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,Howard J Carlson,Todd K Gardner,Eunah Jung,Samuel Kye,Han Liu,John R Logan,Rachel McKane,Elisabeta Minca,Jongho Won,Hongwei Xu,Wenquan Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected almost every aspect of food supply chain, from farm gate to food processing/manufacturing plant through to grocery store. The crisis is expected to have a large impact on and reshape the food sectors in long-lasting ways.

The U.S. federal government signed a Compact of Free Association [COFA] with these Micronesian nations in the 1980s and 1990s which allowed COFA citizens to live and work in the U.S. without a visa. Media accounts discuss a growing stigma against COFA citizens in Hawaii and their unique immigration status reduces their access to important social services. I ask the following questions: 1) how does the immigration status of COFA migrants inform their housing, employment, poverty, and healthcare outcomes and do these outcomes change during times of significant legislative change that affects access to social services and 2) how does the intersection of structural inequalities based on race, class, gender and migration status shape COFA migrant resource access in Hawaii? Using 1990-2020 Decennial Census and American Community Surveys, I conduct logistic regression analyses to isolate the effect of COFA status on poverty, employment and healthcare access and use the multi-group entropy index and index of net difference to examine patterns of segregation in Honolulu County. Findings support that COFA status is associated with more poverty, lower employment, less healthcare, and that these outcomes worsen over time. Additionally, COFA citizens are increasingly segregated in lower-income areas of Honolulu County. This adds to existing literature by analyzing how immigration status beyond the undocumented/citizen binary influences degrees of exclusion which speaks to broader research on how immigration status affects immigrant incorporation.",2,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Sabrina Nasir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The core of the project will examine labor market scarring. While the conditions at the time of labor market entry can have potentially lasting effects on career trajectories, life-course income, and the intergenerational transmission of wealth, recent work has focused on the relatively short-term consequences of graduating into a recession, largely because for recent downturns, timescale and privacy concerns together limit the data necessary for a comprehensive, life-course perspective. In this project, we overcome these limitations by turning to a setting that is both intrinsically important, and which allows us visibility into issues of long-run scarring: the Great Depression.

In this project, we will test for nonresponse bias in the NLSY79 (birth years 1957-1964) and NLSY97 (birth years 1980-1984) by matching the NLS records to the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Census (DC) surveys and the American Community Survey (ACS). Matching to these datasets will allow us to compare NLS respondents to non-respondents in terms of key variables representing a range of economic and social characteristics. The DC short-form data, though they cover a limited set of topics, can be matched to nearly all NLS sample members. The long-form DC and ACS are more comprehensive in terms of topics but have smaller samples. We will use the matched data to estimate statistical models that address three issues related to nonresponse in NLS surveys. First, we will estimate how outcomes measured at a point in time in the DC short-form data (marital status, number of children, household structure and size, and geography) are related to the likelihood of nonresponse in the NLS. Second, we will use the DC long-form and ACS data to estimate how nonresponse affects regression estimates of economic relationships, such as the returns to education.

2527,Active,Linking Worker and Firm Dynamics,Baruch,2021,,Sebastian Heise,"To what extent are workers' careers tied to the fate of their employers? How does worker composition change over a firm's life cycle? And how are firms' incentives to invest and expand tied to worker dynamics? These questions are fundamental for understanding the interaction between workers and firms in the U.S. labor market. Existing studies of worker and firm heterogeneity usually take a static view of the labor market, in which the dynamics of firms (e.g., firm entry, exit, and growth) do not affect worker outcomes. Conversely, the dynamics of workers (e.g., worker transitions and life-cycle mobility patterns) do not affect firm outcomes. This project will explore the empirical relationship between worker and firm dynamics over time and space using the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and the Economic Census datasets of the U.S. Census Bureau. The project investigates three sets of empirical hypotheses. First, it examines how workers' attachment to their birth county and state affects their mobility and wages, and analyzes whether firms' location decisions are influenced by workers' regional attachment. Second, the project studies whether certain groups of workers benefit more from working at ""high-productivity"" firms than others, and whether differences in geographical or industrial mobility explain these results. Finally, the project tests whether younger employers are equally attractive to work for, conditional on pay, as old employers and analyzes to what extent employer pay and nonpay amenities determine worker attraction and retention.",33,American Community Survey,ACS,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-GALT26-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,Jason Chen,Emilien Gouin-Bonenfant,Sebastian Heise,Kathryn C McDonald,Christian A Moser,William H Nober,Tommaso Porzio,William R Schirmer,Aiden C Toner-Rodgers,Julia Y Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2528,Active,Worker and Firm Responses to Changes in the Business Environment,Triangle,2021,,Earnest Curtis,"This research will consider how workers are affected by shocks such as changes to the cost of investing in physical capital, environmental policy changes, energy price shocks, housing price shocks, and shocks to the fiscal conditions of local governments. Many of these shocks will be relevant for economic conditions like those experienced following the Covid-19 pandemic, either experienced as direct effects associated with economic downturns or through associated government or employer responses to the shocks/downturns. Effects of these shocks may occur directly as firms adjust inputs to reflect changes in effective prices, or indirectly as the shocks change the structure of labor markets and interact with existing labor market frictions. The researchers will relatedly examine how labor market characteristics can mitigate or exacerbate the effects of economic shocks on workers. Specifically, researchers will study three mechanisms through which shocks may affect workers that are likely of particular importance in the wake of a Covid-19 pandemic-induced economic downturn: barriers to occupational mobility, local labor market power, and state/local government finances. Barriers to occupational mobility may stop workers from being able to switch to alternative occupations when they experience shocks. Local labor market power possessed by firms, similarly, can prevent workers from flexibly switching to alternative sources of employment when experiencing a shock. Finally, financial stability of state and local governments may affect how different types of workers are able to weather employment shocks. Assessing the importance of these channels will provide guidance for addressing the effects of economic shocks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic on worker outcomes.",15,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Household Pulse Survey,HH_PULSE_SURVEY,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8.0,Earnest Curtis,Maya E Donovan,Clare M Doyle,Jason Harrison,Michael Lipsitz,Eric Ohrn,Kevin A Roberts,Juan Carlos Suarez Serrato,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2534,Active,New Directions in Research on Immigration and Crime,Irvine,2022,,John R Hipp,"Despite significant advances in the literature on immigration and crime, as well as several noteworthy findings, critical areas of inquiry remain. Extending prior research that often lumps all immigrants together and neglects important differences across groups, this project will distinguish between immigrant composition based on race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and country of origin. We will create novel conceptualizations of immigrant neighborhoods. Furthermore, the project will take into account the macro context in which this immigration occurs--that is, characteristics of the broader city and county context, as well as immigration-related policies and practices--and assess whether this moderates these relationships. Combining public use crime data aggregated to census tracts with restricted access data housed at the RDC will allow us to construct measures of immigrant concentration based on household-level data that is localized at the neighborhood (census tract) level on ancestry, income, and citizenship status (i.e., the American Community Survey). To account for the fact that only a subset of criminal actions are reported to police, we will also use geocoded information available on the restricted National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to identify factors associated with individual-level reporting of crime to local law enforcement. We will also use the RDC data to construct measures of neighborhood inequality based on household-level survey data (e.g., American Community Survey, Decennial Census). The analyses will use data from a variety of sources over many years (2000-2016), allowing us to refine and advance our understanding of the immigration-crime relationship. One set of analyses will examine the immigration-crime relationship focusing on differences among immigrants based on citizenship status, reason or motive for migration, and level of assimilation. Another set of analyses will provide an alternative conceptualization and operationalization of immigrant neighborhoods. A third set of analyses will consider the extent to which the broader city-context of reception as well as immigration-related policies and practices condition the immigration-crime relationship.",3,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,National Crime Victimization Survey,NCVS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,Derek Christopher,John R Hipp,Charis Kubrin,Xiaoshuang Luo,Emily Owens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2539,Active,Firms and Economic Geography,Missouri,2021,,Hannah F Rubinton,"This project will use micro data to document differences in establishment productivity and wages across space. A key focus will be to understand how these differences across establishments aggregate to determine regional differences in productivity and wages and how differences in regional productivity have been affected by changes in business dynamism, productivity growth and the geographic expansion of large firms. 

First, we will analyze the spatial differences in measures of business dynamism (such as the firm start up rate and exit rate, job creation and job destruction, and job separation and job finding rates). In previous work, we have documented that the relationship between business dynamism and city size (measured in population) has changed over time (Rubinton, 2020 under Census project 1975). In 1980, there was no relationship between dynamism and city size, while today big cities are much more dynamic than small cities. A key question will be to explore the causes of the changing patterns of business dynamism across space and the implications for productivity growth. 

Second, we will examine whether patterns of geographic convergence in productivity measures at the firm and establishment level have changed. Previous work has documented that income convergence between poor and wealthy regions in the United States has stopped after 1980. We will examine if the same patterns hold when looking at productivity and worker wages and then explore the underlying causes of the convergence patterns we document. Key areas of interest will be to examine the impact of technology diffusion and adoption, business dynamism, innovation and the geographic expansion of large firms on convergence in productivity and wages. 

Third, we will analyze the geography of technology diffusion and adoption. We will approach this question in several different ways. One method will be to look at whether industries are becoming more concentrated in space. We will look at which industry characteristics are important for determining their geographic concentration, such as age of the industry and measures of innovation or technology use. We will also examine technology diffusion more directly by examining whether local characteristics are important for determining whether or not firms adopt new technologies or whether or not they choose to innovate. We will ask how differences in technology diffusion and concentration impact regional differences in productivity and wages.

Fourth, we will examine whether patterns of selection have changed over time and across space and how this will matter for productivity growth. By selection, we mean the correlation between a firm's productivity and the probability that they exit the market. We will examine the factors that affect selection such as changes in congestion forces in frontier and lagging cities. We will then look at the effect of changes in selection for productivity growth and wage growth across space.",36,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Commodity Flow Survey,CFS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Foreign Trade Data - Export,EXP,Foreign Trade Data - Import,IMP,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) - 2014,LEHD-GAL-2014,LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-GALT26-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ICFT26-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,LEHD Successor-Predecessor File (SPF) - 2014,LEHD-SPF-2014,LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) - 2014,LEHD-U2W-2014,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Monthly Retail Trade Survey,MRTS,Ownership Change Database,OCD,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Survey of Manufacturing Technology,SMT,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Victoria Gregory,Margaret Isaacson,Xian Jiang,Jeremy Majerovitz,Charly J Porcher,Hannah F Rubinton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially true for commutes made using public transit, where walking makes up a substantial portion of commutes. We propose to improve estimates of commuting time and accessibility by worker income and industry, as well as estimating the extent of the MAUP in comparable studies, by using precise origin-destination pairs derived from linked American Community Survey and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. We supplement these data with detailed, external information about transit networks and associated travel times.

2541,Active,The Effect of Exogenous Housing Displacement on Commute Time,Philadelphia,2021,,Joshua H Davidson,"To best investigate how commute time may change, and thereby (hypothetically) improve the socio-economic quality of life for working people, particularly low-income workers, I propose to isolate and expand on one factor that is not considered in enough depth in the literature: exogenous residential change, more commonly referred to as a forced move, or displacement. The hypothesis I wish to test is whether the displaced, particularly the low-income population forced to move, face longer commutes, measured by time, post-displacement than they faced pre-displacement.
I plan to conduct my study across two different research question. First, how do exogenous housing shocks that force an individual to move residences - operationalized through public housing eradication in the HOPE VI program - impact a worker's commute time, measured as a change in their commute time pre versus post displacement. Second, using transportation models, geospatial methods, and new, open-source trip routing algorithms, I will explore how the effect of exogenous housing displacement may differentially effect commute time when it is modeled across public transit, private automobile, or other transport modes (cycling, walking, etc.). 
The methodology will generally follow a quasi-experimental research design, that will seek to employ the benefits of individual-level, panel data to isolate the effects of an exogenous independent variable (displacement from residence via public housing eradication, conducted as part of, but not limited to the HOPE VI program) on a dependent variable (commute time). The model specification will be a difference-in-difference regression model that takes advantage of the panel data's structure. Furthermore, my focus on a residential move due to assumed exogenous reasons (rather than an individual's desire to move) will allow for isolating possible causality in changes to commute time.",10,American Community Survey,ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,HUD Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS),HUD-TRACS,HUD Public and Indian Housing Information Center (PIC),HUD_PIC,HUD PIC and TRACS Longitudinal,HUD_PICTRACS_LNGTDNL,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Joshua H Davidson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2542,Active,Globalization and the Rise of Dispersion in Firm Performance,Chicago,2021,,Binyamin Kleinman Orleansky,"In the past few decades, U.S. industries have experienced an increase in market concentration and productivity dispersion. The divergence in firm performance raises concerns regarding potential abuse of market and political power by large ``superstar'' firms, emphasizing the importance of understanding its underlying reasons. Recent literature has focused on the potential roles of the changes in the U.S. anti-trust regime and the rise of information technology (IT). This project studies the role of globalization, i.e. whether increased access to foreign output and input markets, concentrated within large firms, has amplified their ex-ante advantages in the U.S. market. We will use Census Bureau restricted data on foreign activity and firm performance to document how dispersion in access to foreign markets has evolved over time; how did increased market access affect domestic market shares and price-cost markups; and whether the differences in market access can explain observed changes in the distribution of productivity, sales and employment, and specifically the reallocation of production to large firms.

Despite the central importance criminal deterrence plays in immigration enforcement, there is little research on the impact of immigration enforcement on the criminal environment in the United States. In our project, we plan to evaluate the effect of changes in immigration enforcement on both crime rates and crime reporting behavior. To measure crime rates and willingness to report crime, we intend to use the National Criminal Victimization Survey (NCVS), a survey that is uniquely able to measure crime reporting behavior conditional on victimization. Our main measure of immigration enforcement will be monthly counts of the number of ICE detainers issued in each county in the United States, measured using supplemental data from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRACFed). We will measure immigration enforcement in two ways. First, we will study the rollout of the Secure Communities program between 2008 and 2014, which enhanced cooperation between local and federal law enforcement and subsequently increased the number of detainers and deportations. Second, we will measure the number of individuals detained by immigration agencies in a county-by-year and use an instrumental variables strategy to identify the causal effect of changes in the intensity of immigration enforcement. Moreover, our analysis will test how impacts on victimization and reporting vary according to survey participant demographics or by the types of individuals who are detained (e.g., their country of origin).",2,NCVS Contact History Instrument (CHI),NCS_CHI,National Crime Victimization Survey,NCVS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,Felipe Goncalves,Elisa Jacome,Emily Weisburst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2547,Active,Civil Rights Legislation and the Labor Market Conditions of Southern-born Black Americans,Atlanta,2022,,Celeste Carruthers,"Among the leading explanations for Black income convergence in the 20th century U.S., the improved quality of southern schools and a suite of Civil Rights era employment protections are dominant. We assess the impact of each change, alone and in concert, by following Americans born between 1902 and 1932 through their work lives. Our earlier work indicates that poor school quality was the proximate cause of income inequality for this group at labor market entry in 1940. We merge school quality data from the segregated pre-1940 South with restricted access Census and Social Security earnings data to investigate the long-term legacy of separate and unequal schooling. We take advantage of cross-cohort and geographic variability in the quality of pre-War Black schools, along with teacher salary schedules and Rosenwald school-building campaigns that drove some of that variation quasi-experimentally, to uncover causal effects of school quality on the shape of long-term age-earnings profiles.

Since the ""long term"" for these cohorts overlapped with the Civil Rights era, we can additionally explore whether there were corrective effects of Civil Rights era legislation, in part by measuring whether the race-specific and race-by-gender-specific returns to school quality and experience changed after the mid-1960s.

We are interested in establishments in the ""customer-facing"" sector, by which we mean both traditional in-person retail, as well as in-person food and in-person personal services. The once-in-a-generation technological change brought by the Internet fundamentally alters the frictions consumers face in searching for goods. Specifically, we seek to answer three main research questions: (1) Since consumption search and matching costs, rather than firm input costs, play a more prominent role in location for customer-facing firms, how do patterns of customer-facing agglomeration differ from those for manufacturing?; (2) Has the rise of the Internet caused a change in the spatial pattern of customer-facing agglomeration and establishment co-location, especially in urban settings?; and (3) Has the rise of the Internet changed the fundamental building blocks of cities - land use and property value?  

We answer these questions using establishment-specific location data from the Census Bureau, combined with administrative property data and proprietary CoStar lease level data for the two largest metropolitan areas in the United States: New York and Los Angeles.

We investigate three cases: (1) Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans; (2) the US home foreclosure crisis; and (3) the COVID-19 epidemic. The first case studies Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina caused an unprecedented displacement of the population of an entire U.S. city when residents of Orleans Parish, Louisiana (the City of New Orleans) were forced to evacuate in August 2005. To study the long-term outcomes of the disaster-affected population using a quasi-experimental design, we link representative data on pre-Katrina individuals from New Orleans to information on their mortality and subsequent residential locations as well as other social and economic outcomes in the years following the disaster. The nationwide studies of the home foreclosure crisis and the COVID-19 epidemic also employ a quasi-experimental design. These two cases affected the entire U.S. population with spatial variation in the timing and intensity of their effects. Using spatial indices of exposure to the home foreclosures and COVID-19, we will measure variation across regions and between demographic groups on mortality, residential mobility, and other social and economic outcomes.

Labor markets in practice, however, are local. Understanding the interaction between local labor market concentration and the generosity of UI benefits therefore helps us learn more about the role of local labor markets in shaping outcomes for unemployed workers. Most of the existing literature on UI extensions finds no effect on the quality of subsequent employment matches. Motivated by the local nature of labor markets, I contribute to this literature by providing the first evidence of how local labor market concentration affects the quality of matches following an unemployment spell. I propose using the Employer Characteristics File, Employment History File, Unit-to-Worker Impute File, Individual Characteristics File, and Individual Characteristics T26 Components file from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau from 2005 to 2015 to study UI benefit extensions during the Great Recession. I will use a differences-in-differences approach that exploits a natural experiment which caused longer eligibility for benefits in some states with otherwise similar labor market conditions as other states. My main approach will estimate how labor market outcomes are affected by the interaction of these exogenous changes in UI benefit duration at the state level and local labor market concentration.

On the other hand, if more R&D leads to a more educated workforce, then locations may need to invest in R&D tax credits or other incentives for companies.

Specifically, we are interested in understanding the role of heterogeneity in worker types for a variety of macroeconomic outcomes. First, we investigate the role of worker composition for aggregate productivity growth. Second, we analyze the importance of worker composition in determining the success of startups and the spillovers from startups to other firms. Third, we estimate the degree of labor market power in the US economy and investigate the extent to which market power interacts with worker composition. The lack of a comprehensive source of micro-level data covering the majority, if not the whole, of the US economy has impeded a structural analysis on the above research questions. Therefore, we propose to use micro-level data from the Census Bureau to uncover new facts on firm- and worker-level outcomes and how these observations will aid us in understanding the sources of heterogeneity in US aggregate outcomes and how these have evolved over time.",22,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data PIK Crosswalk,IP_INVENTOR_CROSSWALK,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database,LFTTD,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,Matthew L Haumann,William E Schmidt,Bradley Setzler,Chen Yeh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I analyze this issue using data from 2014 Panel and 2018 Panel of the restricted-use Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). My economic approach is to use the policy assigning housing vouchers based on an income cutoff as an instrument to study the effect of housing vouchers on low-income people's employment, family formation and homeownership. The assignment policy states that households with income lower than 50% of the median income for the MSA/county area are eligible for housing vouchers. In order to infer the household eligibility status, I need the household MSA/county code, which is accessible through the SIPP restricted-use data. With household eligibility status, I compare the households whose incomes are slightly below the income cutoff (eligible households) with households whose incomes are slightly above the income cutoff (ineligible households) to identify the effect of housing vouchers on employment, family formation and homeownership. This project will contribute to understanding the effect of Section 8 Housing Voucher on low-income households' labor supply, family formation and homeownership decisions as well as the welfare implication of such housing assistance programs on low income households.

To precisely measure how rising industrial concentration has shifted the ownership of establishments toward multi-market firms, we plan to link multiple Census Bureau microdata sources, including the Annual Surveys, Economic Censuses, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). We develop a flexible method for high-dimensional data to construct new annual estimates of establishment-level sales and productivity. This method deploys a Bayesian interpolation procedure on the sparse time series of establishment-level data from the five-year Economic Census to interpolate measures in missing years, incorporating a rich set of establishment-, firm-, and region-level characteristics. We will use these interpolated variables to examine the economic consequences of increasing concentration in two areas. First, our work studies the potential for large firms to amplify short-run economic fluctuations. We will examine how shocks to a large firm's financial health or technological capabilities can have persistent effects on regions due to spillovers onto workers and other businesses. We will also estimate the extent to which large, multi-unit firms make joint employment and investment decisions in a way that causes business cycle shocks to propagate across the regions or workers in the firm's network.

Much of the previous literature has attempted to answer this question using population-level or aggregate data. If the mortality effects of health insurance are small, however, they will be difficult to detect without detailed data linking mortality records to individual characteristics that identify the individuals most likely to benefit from health insurance. We aim to study the effects of Medicare on mortality by examining whether mortality changes at the Medicare age-65 eligibility cutoff using a regression discontinuity framework. We link the ACS and Decennial Census data to the Numident file using PIK crosswalks. Importantly, the Numident records contain exact dates of birth and death for individuals with a Social Security Number, which allows us to precisely identify Medicare eligibility (our treatment) and death (our outcome variable). The large sample size and granular dates in the Numident file makes it more likely that we would be able to detect small changes in mortality.

This project exploits large historical changes in tax legislation and regional institutional features of tax assessment in order to obtain shifts in taxation that are uncorrelated with business conditions. In conjunction with microdata on establishment-level outcomes from the U.S. Census Bureau, this variation will yield estimates of a range of business responses to taxes, including changes to wages, employment, revenue, prices, and location decisions. The central empirical design relies on merging an external dataset, comprised of publicly available regional property and transfer tax rates and parcel-level property records, to multiple U.S. Census Bureau datasets, including the County Business Patterns Business Register, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the Economic Census. This linkage will permit estimation of establishment-level event-study models as well as comparisons between Census records and the external data. This study will yield the first rigorous empirical estimates of responses to taxes on business property.

One key aspect of government responses to Covid-19 has been an attempt to help firms remain afloat during and after the associated lockdowns. Based on a belief that the crisis would be short-lived, but that the effects of inefficient firm churn can be long-lasting, solutions have tended to promote business hibernation by extending liquidity to firms facing fixed operating costs but diminished cash inflows. The underlying premise assumes a tight link between financial distress and bankruptcy that does not necessarily depend on firm fundamentals, a premise that contrasts with workhorse models of firm dynamics in which exit patterns greatly depend on firms' idiosyncratic productivity levels. Using granular empirical evidence, this project will investigate the role of financial factors in firms' exit decisions, and whether the relevance of these factors fluctuates with the business cycle. The hypothesis is that firm exit in normal times is driven by the long-run sustainability of business operations (solvency), but that short-term restrictions in access to credit markets (illiquidity), play a sizable role during downturns. Accordingly, the researchers will study the sensitivity of firm exit to financial health, controlling for other firm characteristics, as a function of the business cycle.",12,Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS),BDS,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Supplementary Public Data - International and Trade Data,INTL_TRADE_DATA,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Gideon Bornstein,Laura Castillo-Martinez,Catherine L Gonzalez,Tanvi Jindal,Weiting Miao,Paige Stevenson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2608,Completed,"The Dynamics of Compensation at Young, High Growth Firms",UCLA,2021,2022.0,Anthony Papac,"Over the last ten years, research on worker mobility has uncovered a number of facts about the direction and composition of worker flows in the US economy. For example, Goetz et al. (2015) found that workers tend to move from older to younger firms, and Crane (2014) discovered that workers with higher previous wages tend to move from slower growing to faster growing firms. However, little work has been done to investigate the wage recruitment strategies causing so many high wage workers to move to younger, faster-growing firms. This project fills the gap in the literature by investigating the wage recruitment strategies that young, high growth firms use to attract and ultimately poach workers from other firms. Using linked employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics and Longitudinal Business Database, the researchers of this project plan to decompose the starting salary of workers using the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (AKM 1999) model of additive worker and firm fixed effects. Moreover, the researchers will use the AKM 1999 model to estimate the returns to tenure at firms of different ages and growth trajectories. Finally, the researchers will use information on the number of hours worked for workers in the LEHD who were also surveyed by the American Community Survey to compare the starting hourly wages and hourly wage growth of workers at younger, faster growing firms with those of workers at older, slower-growing firms.",8,American Community Survey,ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) T26 Components - 2014,LEHD-ECFT26-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) - 2014,LEHD-QWI-2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Anthony Papac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first investigate whether there are spillover effects of the shock across plants, i.e. whether plants in non-treated regions change their level of capital and employment following a shock occurred to other plants located in another region but that belong to the same firm. Second, we aim to identify the local government intervention using data on the loans given by the Small Business Administration to firms hit by a natural disaster. To estimate the spillover effect of the policy, we compare untreated plants belonging to firms that were hit by a disaster and were provided public funds, against untreated plants belonging to firms equally hit by a comparable disaster that were not helped.

2644,Active,The Impact of Housing Assistance on Residential Environmental Exposures,Baruch,2022,,Catherine L Connolly,"Housing assistance is associated with improved physical and mental health for children and adults and may impact health by improving housing quality and the residential environment. However, few studies have examined the impact of housing assistance on residential environmental exposures and their determinants, such as indoor and outdoor pollutant sources, product usage, resident activity patterns, and the design and maintenance of building systems. In addition, there are limited comprehensive measures of residential environmental exposures at the national level.
This study will investigate the relationship between federal housing assistance and residential environmental exposures. We hypothesize that residential environmental exposures will be significantly different between residents living in HUD-assisted housing programs and residents living in other types of low-income housing due to differences in: compliance with federal regulations and policies specific to public housing and privately-owned multifamily properties, management and maintenance practices, and physical attributes of the housing stock. 

To conduct this analysis, we developed a national, multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI) from the public American Housing Survey (AHS) based on questions about housing quality, physical infrastructure, indoor hazards, product usage, and resident satisfaction. Using the geocodes available in the restricted-use AHS files, we will examine the associations of the HEQI with neighborhood measures of ambient air pollution, socioeconomic, and environmental conditions. Information about HUD assistance program type in the restricted AHS files will allow for comparisons of mean HEQI scores by type of assistance, as well as across income levels, housing type, sociodemographic subgroups, and neighborhood conditions. We will run multivariable models to estimate the relative risks of having poor HEQI scores, overall and within each HEQI domain, between assisted and unassisted households. The proposed study will advance our research understanding of whether housing assistance is an effective tool for reducing socioeconomic inequalities in residential environmental exposures, with important implications for social, housing, and public health policy",2,American Community Survey (ACS) and Linked HUD-Subsidized Administrative data,ACSHUD,American Housing Survey,AHS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Catherine L Connolly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2652,Active,"Volatility Shocks, Financial Frictions, and Worker Reallocation",Missouri,2021,,Yajie Wang,"This project studies the effect of volatility shocks on worker reallocation through the financial channel. When the volatility of firm-level productivity increases, firms are more likely to go bankrupt because of the higher likelihood of bad shocks, especially for firms with higher leverage. Since workers bear losses after their firms' bankruptcy, highly leveraged firms need to pay higher wages as compensation and hire less. Consequently, a positive volatility shock generates worker outflows from highly leveraged firms to lowly leveraged firms, amplifying the recession. We will use Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data which provides information on firms' employment, workers' earnings, and job transitions. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) supplements the LEHD files for more information on employment and other employer characteristics. We also prepare external data to supplement firms' financial information, including Compustat and the firm default probabilities calculated from the CRSP Daily Stock dataset. Compustat/CRSP will be linked to the County Business Patterns – Business Register (CBPBR) using the Compustat-SSEL Bridge (CSB). CBPBR also provides internal identifiers to link to LEHD and LBD. Our main empirical tools are multivariate regressions for panel data with fixed effects. We will conduct our empirical analyses at the individual-level (worker-level and firm-level) and worker-firm-level (job-level) to analyze the impact of volatility shocks on firms' employment decisions and default probabilities, workers' earnings, and job transition probabilities conditional on firms' leverage.

Utilizing the matched employee-employer nature of the LEHD and a double fixed effect specification as in Bonhomme et al (2020), we plan to analyze to what extent the observed patterns are driven by different assortative matching at the beginning of the workers' careers. For example, a slower wage growth profile for STEM workers, as previously estimated by Deming and Noray (2020), could be generated by the fact that these workers enter in the labor force better matched than workers with different degrees. 

Our analysis will also include other potential explanations, such as different industrial matching, i.e. the matching between an industry and the skills of the workers, and a discussion on the role of geographical sorting, estimating to which extent these patterns are generated by the fact that labor markets of different sizes employ workers from different majors. We finally plan to estimate whether workers of different degrees are able to absorb or learn skills from their coworkers with different intensities using a framework similar to Jarosh et al.

2679,Active,Parameterizing the Income Distribution,Michigan,2022,,Conrad Kosowsky,"Pareto established a century ago that large incomes follow a power law, but the body of the income distribution is still largely uncharacterized. Rather, authors have modeled incomes using a variety of different distributions including generalized beta, a combination of log-normal and Pareto, and a combination of Boltzman-Gibbs and Pareto. Historically, modeling choices have been even more varied. For this project, I will fill this gap in the literature by establishing which distribution or select multiple distributions fit the data most closely. I will estimate the model parameters and show the fit visually, and I will analyze the error under the best-fitting parametric model. I will use Current Population Survey data from 1970 to 2020 as available, and I will base my analysis on the variables that measure total income and income of different types at the individual, family, and household level. Plotting both the model and the sample density on top of one another allows for a clear and easy judgement on the various fits. I will use both a linear plot to evaluate the fit in the body of the distribution and a log-log plot to evaluate the fit in the tail. My project requires access to restricted data because using publicly available, top-coded data will introduce an unknown amount of error into my estimates. If the error is extreme, it may become less clear which distribution matches most closely.",1,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Conrad Kosowsky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The newly available 2018 Annual Business Survey provides the ideal dataset for identifying these rare firms and for assessing their contribution to the Nation's science and engineering enterprise. The central empirical problem is differentiating the small firms operating in innovation markets--developing innovations that are made available to market-leading incumbents either through acquisition or licensing--from the much more numerous small firms operating in product markets.  This is likely to be a problem even among the subpopulation of R&D performing microbusinesses.  The project will use latent class analysis and information on founder characteristics, sources of revenue, the importance of intellectual property protection, and testing or use of esoteric technologies to derive a probabilistic measure of membership as an innovation market participant. 
Information on innovation market participants will be used to construct a longer time-series of such firms in BRDI-M (2016) and BRDIS (2008-2016) to map the trajectory of these firms through time with links to the Longitudinal Business Database and County Business Patterns Business Register.

Specifically, we will examine whether the likelihood of hate crime victimization and reporting associates with contextual characteristics for all racial/ethnic/gender categories. In addition, we will investigate whether the potential effects of contextual characteristics are different by race, ethnicity, and gender, and whether the possible relationships between the race/ethnicity of the victim and the race/ethnicity of the offender and hate crime victimization and reporting are conditioned by the contextual characteristics. Drawing upon the literature and theory of hate crime victimization and reporting, we develop hypotheses regarding the relationships between hate crime victimization and reporting and contextual characteristics. To achieve our goals, we will combine data on hate crime victimization and crime reporting from the 2005-2015 NCVS and community-/county-/state-level data from multiple sources, including the publicly available Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement. We will analyze these data using the survey Heckprobit selection model.

Quantitative scholars consistently find little evidence of physical displacement within gentrifying areas, but are rarely able to assess the social impacts of gentrification on a wide scale. In this study, I aim to reconcile this gap through a two-step structural equation model and maximum likelihood regression analysis of the 2013 American Housing Survey's Neighborhood Social Capital variables. First, I assess how the multi-dimensional social costs and benefits of neighborhood change might be measured by incorporating these 21 variables into a latent factor analysis. Based on previous literature, I expect to find 5 latent measures of social experience. Then, utilizing longitudinal tract-level data from the American Community Survey, I classify each respondents' neighborhood as gentrifying or not. Using this classification as the primary independent variable, and controlling for various other household- and neighborhood-level factors from the AHS and ACS, I analyze the impact on the social experiences of long-time resident households. I expect to find that living in a gentrifying area is negatively associated with social capital, ties, and efficacy. Therefore, I refer to these impacts as the social costs of gentrification, and provide more nuance to quantitative research beyond the tracking of displaced households.",2,American Housing Survey,AHS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,AJ Golio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will use American Community Survey (ACS) data (2005-2019, and through 2027 as new data become available during the course of the project).

This study will generate population estimates from neighborhood-level models of employment outcomes. These estimates, based on underlying microdata aggregated to the Census tract-level, will increase the Bureau's understanding of the quality of the data contained in the ACS. The estimates produced will not be released into the public domain, but will instead be used in models that examine neighborhood-level employment and poverty status following changes in the minimum wage and the EITC. The research will focus on whether any resulting changes in employment status disproportionally affect socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, either in isolation or when compared to population estimates that are grouped into spatially larger levels of geography. These estimates, constructed from models with Census tract as the unit of observation, will also demonstrate how alternatively aggregated microdata can be used to increase the utility of Census Bureau data for analyzing demographic, economic, and social conditions.

The researchers will exploit publicly-available tract-level aggregates and create their own (non-comparable) aggregates using confidential data. The investigators will generate a panel dataset across spatially and temporally harmonized Census tracts that will allow them to examine local-level outcomes as a function of minimum wage increases.

2695,Active,The Impact of Childhood Medicaid Eligibility on Future Criminal Involvement,Chicago,2022,,Ethan Jenkins,"The United States incarceration rate is more than six times the incarceration rate of a typical OECD country. Additionally, the United States spends around $250 on total correctional expenditures per capita. This number has tripled since 1980. In addition to this fiscal cost, incarceration has lasting negative effects on an individual's future. Given the large fiscal and social cost of incarceration, understanding cost-effective interventions that reduce criminality is important.

I plan to identify the effect of access to Medicaid on subsequent criminal behavior using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) exploiting a policy discontinuity where several Medicaid expansions in the 1980s and early 1990s only applied to those born after September 30, 1983. This variation is almost certainly exogenous since these expansions occurred well after 1983, making it impossible to sort around the cutoff. This policy discontinuity was first used by Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) to identify changes in insurance coverage and healthcare utilization. This discontinuity has been used to show that Medicaid eligibility reduces future teen mortality and adulthood hospitalizations. I would implement this RDD using day-of-birth cohort incarceration rates as the unit of observation.
An alternative identification strategy is to leverage differences across states and time in Medicaid expansion through the 1980s and 1990s using a two-way fixed effects model with simulated Medicaid eligibility. This approach has been widely used to study the effects of childhood Medicaid expansion. To use this strategy the unit of observation would be state month-of-birth cohorts.

The primary data set needed for this project is the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). Using CJARS, I can construct day-of-birth cohort totals for variables such as ever incarcerated, number of years incarcerated, ever charged with a crime, ever found guilty of crime, and ever arrested. Additionally, I would like to disaggregate these totals by race and sex. For the arrest and adjudication tables, I would like to disaggregate by offense type to explore what types of crime are averted. In addition to CJARS, I plan to use the public-use National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Birth Data Files. Using this data, I can calculate the number of people in each day-of-birth cohort for the states with the relevant CJARS coverage. With the criminal involvement totals from CJARS and total population from NVSS Birth Data, I can create rates for each cohort such as percent ever incarcerated. I can use the cohort rates to estimate an RDD.

To estimate a two-way fixed effects model, I can construct similar totals but for day-of-birth state cohorts. No variation in Medicaid eligibility changes within month, so month-of-birth state cohorts is also workable. I will then merge these rates simulated Medicaid eligibility from Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie (2020). This simulated Medicaid eligibility data contains the number of years eligible for Medicaid holding population characteristics fixed. Simulated Medicaid eligibility does not vary within state-month cohorts. It captures changes in Medicaid eligibility due to state law changes. Neither the RD nor two-way fixed-effects approaches need the CJARS data to be linked at the individual level.",2,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,University of Michigan - CJARS,UM_CJARS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Ethan Jenkins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will investigate whether an additional unexpected empirical finding, that firms do not fully exercise their labor market monopsony power, can provide an explanation by enabling firms to adjust their within-firm wage distributions to counteract the intended equity effects of progressive taxation.  To answer this question, we propose a model where a measure of real pre-tax within-firm income inequality (constructed using the LEHD's EHF) is regressed on an interaction term constituted of instrumented measures of within-firm income-tax progressivity (constructed using the LEHD's EHF and researcher-provided tax data) and firm-level labor market monopsony power (constructed using the LEHD's EHF, and establishment-level QWI).  The coefficient on this interaction term will tell us what portion of a change in a firm's income distribution can be attributed to changes in the exercise of monopsony power that are induced by changes in income taxes.  We expect this coefficient to show evidence of widening pre-tax inequality in response to an increase in progressivity.  We then also propose running additional models to investigate the impact of this estimated change on the annual earnings growth of certain demographic groups (defined using information in the LEHD's ICF).  These additional regressions will tell us what groups of workers are most likely to be adversely affected by the unintended consequences of progressive taxation that we estimate in the main regressions.",5,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Amy Lim,Alexander Siebert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2698,Active,"Firm Heterogeneity, Misallocation, and Trade",Atlanta,2022,,Jong Chung,"How does firm-level misallocation modulate the size of the gains from trade? In this project, I propose a way to detect significant deviation from optimal allocation of production factors across firms and develop an open-economy model that incorporates firm-level misallocation. Using the model, I measure the size of the welfare gains from trade liberalization both with and without misallocation to estimate the impact of domestic distortions on the gains from trade. In a broad class of models featuring monopolistic competition, heterogeneous firms, and fixed overhead cost associated with exports, I show that under the optimal allocation, firm size and revenue productivity are positively correlated among non-exporting firms, and firm size and export intensity are positively correlated among exporting firms. I test these correlations in both Chinese manufacturing sector survey data and the US Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) data. Then I extend the canonical model to explicitly allow misallocation. The model parameters are estimated using the same datasets again for China and the US. Preliminary findings show that in the Chinese manufacturing sector, the patterns expected under the optimal allocation fail to hold and that the size of the gains from trade is dampened due to the observed distortions. With the US data, I expect that expected patterns to generally hold and the effect of misallocation on the gains from trade to be smaller in magnitude.",3,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Jong Chung,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explore this topic in three steps, employing a difference-in-differences approach in which hospital mergers serve as a shock to local healthcare costs and utilizing LBDREV, MEPS-IC, ACES, and CMF/ASM. We first study the health insurance outcomes of smaller firms in comparison with larger ones following a shock to healthcare costs, testing the hypothesis that smaller firms are price-takers with respect to health insurance premiums. Given heterogeneous increases in health insurance premiums, theory predicts that smaller firms will be unable to fully pass through costs to employees and will adjust on other margins; we next test this hypothesis by studying economic outcomes such as employment, entry, and exit. Finally, we study the effect of hospital mergers on firms' corporate finances (such as capital expenditures, financial leverage, revenues, and expenses) to provide insight into the channels through which these economic outcomes occur, for example, if lower employment following a shock to healthcare prices is a result of firms shifting from labor to capital or suffering from decreased profitability.",9,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Form 5500 Bridge File,F55BF,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component,MEP,Disclosure Avoidance Population Tables,POP_TABLES,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Samantha Zeller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the 2015-19 American Community Survey (ACS) sample data, this project will investigate the degree to which the identification of children from mixed family backgrounds is altered by adding information beyond the race and Hispanic-origin data stipulated for the children.  In a first step, the ancestry data provided for the children will be considered.  In a second step, the race, Hispanic-origin, and ancestry data for their parents will be added.  The use of the CHCK file will allow the analysis to include data for a sample of non-coresident fathers.  At each step, the children's ethno-racial classification will be reconsidered in light of any new descent information. A second major focus of the project is on the neighborhood contexts where mixed children grow up.  This choice is dictated by the critical role of social segregation in the transmission of inequalities from one generation to the next.   By merging the 2015-19 ACS file of census-tract characteristics with the individual children's records, we will estimate the characteristics of the neighborhoods where mixed children are growing up (e.g., percent of adults with college degrees) and compare them to the equivalent estimates for children belonging to unmixed groups (e.g, neighborhoods of Asian-white children compared to those of Asian-only children on the one hand and of non-Hispanic white children, on the other).   Using multivariate analyses, where neighborhood characteristics constitute the dependent variables, we will also compare mixed and unmixed ethno-racial categories, while controlling for individual and family characteristics, such as parental education and family income.",3,American Community Survey,ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Richard D Alba,Jiwon Lee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2705,Active,Evidence from National Surveys on STEM Workforce Development for Diverse Young Adults,Berkeley,2023,,Byeongdon Oh,"Improving STEM learning and broadening participation in STEM are essential for growing the economy and remaining globally competitive. Nonetheless, after six decades of federal emphasis, the STEM workforce remains non-representative of the US population. With the federal emphasis often on collective benefits, the individual benefits of STEM degrees and occupations are less clear, whether in terms of socioeconomic attainment or well-being. The individual benefits of STEM degrees and occupations for diverse young adults, those under-represented in STEM, are particularly unclear. The structural and interpersonal characteristics of STEM environments that differentiate individual benefits likely also shape selection and persistence in STEM degrees and occupations. We investigate three broad questions: 1) What aspects of STEM environments (e.g., discipline, field) increase the likelihood that students choose and persist in STEM degrees and STEM occupations? 2) Do STEM degrees and STEM occupations relate to socioeconomic attainment and well-being? 3) How do these relationships vary depending on individuals' social position (SES, race, immigration status, and gender)? We seek to utilize restricted-use data from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) linked to the American Community Survey (ACS). The NSCG is a unique source of extensive information on college graduates' experiences in both undergraduate and graduate school.

As both employment and childrearing require substantial time and resource commitments, women facing these decisions likely face trade-offs. Gaining access to public school for children could relax mothers' time constraints, potentially affecting work decisions, the ability to move in response to labor market conditions, and the feasibility and timing of additional children. This study combines information on a child's eligibility for public early childhood education with restricted microdata from the 2000 Decennial Census, 2010 Decennial Census, American Community Survey and LEHD. We use a regression discontinuity design based on child's birthday relative to a school cutoff date to determine how just barely gaining access to early child education one year earlier affects mothers' decisions in the short-, medium-, and long-run from 2000-2025. This project provides new insight into the persistence of family-level effects of early childhood education provision as we evaluate many family outcomes, explore a long time horizon, and study mediating pathways in children's outcomes.",11,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF) - 2014,LEHD-ECF-2014,LEHD Employment History File (EHF) - 2014,LEHD-EHF-2014,LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF) - 2014,LEHD-ICF-2014,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Jocelyn Wikle,Riley Wilson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disparities in robot adoption rates between large-, and Small and Medium-sized Manufacturers (SMM)s are becoming a substantial issue in the U.S. However, there are surprisingly few empirical studies highlighting such imbalance. To increase understanding of robot diffusion, this study seeks to contribute empirical evidence of factors that influence SMMs' decisions on robot adoption.

Using the integrated dataset, we will 1) evaluate the robotic data collected in ASM and ABS, 2) examine establishment- and regional-level factors that influence robot adoption, and 3) investigate cross-interaction between firm sizes and regional characteristics. We expect to find regional advantages that play a critical role in facilitating robot adoption and SMMs are more susceptible to such influence.

I first provide summary statistics and graphical output, which will provide insights into decisions made by firms of different sizes and industries. I then estimate wage floor impact on technological adoption by regression, using imports, capital expenditures, and employment to construct measures of adoption. The estimates and summary measures are important for understanding wage floor policies' impacts on the already increasing trend in automation, and they will also be utilized in a theoretical model in later work to connect the impact on technological adoption with other connected decisions, such as entry and exit, labor decisions, and wages.

Recent research using CPS data has indicated small wage gains for minority workers. The initial goal of the project is to replicate those estimates with more extensive data and to identify wage disparities across different gender, race, and age groups. However, salary history bans generate informational asymmetry where a worker's current employer has salary information that other employers do not, barring voluntary disclosure. Thus, they may also induce higher turnover in the form of job-to-job transitions among these same individuals, something not easily testable in CPS data. Towards this goal I intend to use the following elements of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data from 2013 onwards: Employer Characteristics File (ECF), Employment History File (EHF), Individual Characteristics File (ICF), and Successor-Predecessor File (SPF).

This (mis)allocation of investment capital across firms, especially for smaller firms, can still impact the aggregate economy through two distinct channels. First, the distortions affecting smaller firms influence the decisions of larger firms through product and input market competition. Second, if financial frictions hold back small firms today from trade, investment, and innovation, these firms will likely remain small in the future. While it is known that the few largest firms in the economy account for most output and exports, it is also the case that we know little about how certain small firms ultimately became large. 

In this project, we aim to provide firm and establishment-level evidence in both the cross-section and over time for how financial constraints distort U.S. firms' total output, exports, and innovation and investment decisions. We will construct a detailed panel dataset of firm activity using Census datasets including the EC, LBD, and LFTTD, and merge it to external datasets containing firm-level financial data such as Compustat and Dealscan. Our methodology consists of isolating clean credit supply shocks in the cross-section and using difference-in-differences estimations to track how these frictions affect firm decisions and outcomes.

The Flexner Era was characterized by an increase in medical school standards and saw the number of medical schools in the United States decline by 40%, due to closures and mergers. The Flexner Era culminated with the release of the Flexner Report (1910), which recommended the closure of all but 28 medical schools in the United States. We begin by documenting the time-path of physician concentration at the county-level from 1900-2020. To do this we make use of publicly available full-count Decennial Census data from 1900-1940 and restricted access long-form Decennial Census and ACS data from 1950-2020. We next construct a measure of how impacted each county was by Flexner Era medical school closures based on proximity to closures and the number of graduates from closed schools. Our results indicate that counties more impacted by school closures had relatively fewer physicians per capita in the post-Flexner Era - a result that persisted until at least 1940. We plan to extend this analysis to 2020 using the restricted access long-form Decennial Census and ACS data to determine if these results persisted into the modern era. We also plan to examine how the decrease in physician concentration resulting from Flexner-era school closures impacted population health by studying mortality.

In addition to measuring overall effects of childhood neighborhoods on adult political behavior, we will also investigate whether neighborhood's influence is larger at certain ages. Furthermore, we will measure heterogeneous effects by demographic characteristics and location to uncover the mechanisms by which childhood environments shape political behavior.

Idiosyncratic shocks affecting one firm are known to propagate upstream and downstream over supply chains. Direct and indirect customers of firms hit by idiosyncratic shocks, such as natural disasters, experience significant declines in sales growth and profitability. However, while the existing literature documents the risk of propagation, little is known on how firms react when negative shocks affect their customers and suppliers. The purpose of this project to conduct a micro-level analysis that documents how shocks that disrupt supply chains affect customers' investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions. The project will conduct this analysis in two parts that complement each other: First, we conduct an ""ex post"" analysis by examining how realized disruptions of suppliers' production affect customers' investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions as well as their productivity.  Second, we complement the ""ex post"" analysis in the first part with an ""ex ante"" analysis.

An important motivation for electrifying the trucking industry is to relieve the disproportionate burden of local air pollution on disadvantaged communities. We study the role of charging infrastructure in determining the distributional consequences of truck electrification. We first build a micro-founded framework that measures pollution inequality in conjunction with the underlying income inequality. This framework allows us to decompose welfare into income size and inequality, analyze inequality within and between demographic groups, and investigate the long-term effects of inequality given the human capital cost of pollution. To apply this framework to truck electrification, we estimate a transport mode choice model based on Commodity Flow Survey data, simulate which shipments would adopt the electric truck mode under various charging infrastructure designs, and calculate the economic and pollution effects of those adoption patterns.  Our inequality framework then combines those effects of truck electrification with American Community Survey data to quantify the distributional consequences of truck electrification and identify charging infrastructure designs that best support equality and efficiency.",8,American Community Survey,ACS,Commodity Flow Survey - T13,CFS_T13,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Supplementary Public Data - County Characteristics,PUBLIC_COUNTY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Cuicui Chen,Daiqiang Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2769,Active,"The Effects of Place-Based Treatments on Neighborhoods, Incumbent Residents, and In-Migration",Philadelphia,2022,,Evan Mast,"The neighborhood where one lives has been shown to have important impact on adults' and children's outcomes. And while much research has studied the impacts of neighborhood-level (place-based) treatments such as Empowerment Zones, housing demand shocks, or recession shocks on aggregate neighborhood outcomes, data limitations have made it difficult to study how these treatments affect incumbent neighborhood residents (Neumark and Simpson 2015). Yet answering this question is crucial to understanding the distributional consequences of these treatments and, for certain treatments, the effectiveness of potential policy responses. For example, the distributional consequences of a neighborhood-level treatment are very different if it improves aggregate labor market outcomes by improving employment and incomes of incumbent residents---particularly in low-income neighborhoods---or if it improves aggregate outcomes through displacement of incumbents and selective in-migration of employed, higher-income residents. Similarly, understanding the extent to which incumbent labor market improvements in a neighborhood might be offset by rising rents for incumbents (through rising in-migration) are also important for understanding the distributional consequences of place-based treatments.	

This project will study the effects of place-based treatments on neighborhoods, incumbent residents, and in-migration by leveraging unique features of the LEHD and Census Bureau data sets such as the Decennial Censuses, American Community Surveys (ACS), and Master Address File-Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF). Combining these data sets will provide detailed residential location information for millions of individuals; important outcomes such as employment and income, rents, and house values; and detailed demographic characteristics such as education levels.

Specifically, it will quantify the roles of vertical and horizontal job differentiation and coordination among firms as sources of monopsony power in labor markets.  

This project will construct two primary analysis files. The first will use the ACS, National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN), and LEHD ICF to build a panel of Registered Nurses working in healthcare facilities. We link this panel to the LEHD ECF and Revenue-Enhanced LBD (LBDREV) to incorporate information about employers. We further enrich this file by linking in external data on healthcare facilities from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) and Provider of Services (POS) data, and California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Quarterly Financial and Utilization Reports. We additionally link in external data on inpatient claims at healthcare facilities from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project (HCUP). We use this panel to model several main outcomes of interest: wages, employment, and healthcare quality. 

The second file will link the LEHD ICF to the LEHD ECF and LBDREV to build a panel of individuals not restricted to individuals working in healthcare facilities. Individuals will be classified into labor markets defined by their education, experience, and wages rather than into a labor market defined by occupation as in the first file (Registered Nurses). This panel will also be used to model wages and employment as the main outcomes of interest. 

We will study the switching of individuals across employers and how this varies over time and across labor markets. We will decompose the variation in earnings of individuals within labor markets into: an individual's marginal product (individual fixed effect), a firm's wage premium (firm fixed effect), and time-variant individual controls following Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999).

Concerns about providing these displaced workers with sufficient time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment motivated the adoption of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), which established a rule that requires employers to give affected employees at least 60 days' notice of such an employment action. Such layoff notices could benefit disadvantaged households, by allowing them to supplement temporary decreases in earnings through a credit channel. Alternatively, by giving workers time to self-insure, layoff notices could unintendedly exacerbate debt problems for disadvantaged households, which has important consequences for households, lenders, and the overall labor market. Using data on roughly 50,000 mass layoffs in the U.S. (from 2000 to 2018) obtained from WARN notices, TransUnion monthly credit report data, and the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics database, we estimate whether credit-constrained workers are better off when they are warned of a layoff.",10,BOC PIK Crosswalk Transunion Credit File,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_TU,Transunion Credit File,COMM_TU,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Sophia B Moore,Christopher R Stewart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I then quantify the impact of innovations produced on productivity in different regions via the same inter-city innovation networks, and the impact of inventor in-migration on the subsequent skill mix of the region.

To examine the aggregate impact on innovation production, I build a parsimonious spatial model with endogenous agglomeration forces that spillover across cities. I then endogenize the formation of co-inventor networks via the search and matching of inventors in different locations to illustrate how falling communication costs impacts the spatial networks of inventors. I embed these spatial networks of innovation into a quantitative dynamic urban and trade model that incorporates the migration of inventors and workers and endogenous amenities in each region that varies with the skill mix of the city. I simulate this full model to quantify the general equilibrium welfare impacts of different inventor migration costs, falling communication costs, and place-based innovation policies.",17,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Auxiliary Establishment - ES9200,AUX,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Ivan Rudik,Weiliang Tan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will link a variety of Census datasets, including the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the Small Business Pulse Survey (SBPS) with external data on participation in government support programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). 
In addition to studying SBPS survey nonresponse, we will ask several questions. First, what were the productivity effects of the pandemic? Our empirical approach will mirror Baily et al. (1992) and Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2001). We expect that the pandemic will have increased the entry and exit rates of firms, particularly at the lower end of the productivity distribution, although government support programs may have lessened the degree of reallocation.
Second, we will study the effects of the pandemic, such as on revenues, investment, and participation in government programs, on different types of firms, such as differences across industries, size, and owner characteristics. This analysis will use OLS and IV regressions, where we will instrument participation in government programs with measures of pre-existing banking market characteristics. We expect that the effects of the pandemic will be highly heterogenous, with firm productivity and access to capital playing important roles.
Third, we will study how businesses respond to restrictions on business activity using a discontinuity approach around the borders of states with different levels of restrictions.

2802,Active,Exploring Prosecutor Behavior and Its Impact on Society,Boston,2023,,Chika Okafor,"Prosecutorial behavior is one of the least measured parts of the criminal justice system, and perhaps the most consequential.  And it is impossible to study prosecutors without evaluating their incentives, and one of those is election cycles.  As such, I will investigate how voter preferences, the general public, and the political process affects the decisions of local prosecutors (called district attorneys (DAs) in this proposal), how this relationship has contributed to the emergence of mass incarceration, and how the severity of DA sentencing affects both individual prisoner (e.g., length of time in prison, educational attainment, income) and broader societal outcomes (e.g., unemployment levels, crime levels, economic well-being). Most DAs are elected officials, which suggests the public opinion may impact decision-making.  The decision on whether to charge an individual, on what charges to file, on whether to drop a case, on whether to offer a plea bargain, and on the specific terms of the plea offer remains an unreviewable power of local prosecutors. This project thus represents one of the first comprehensive research agendas in the Economics literature that centers the role and influence of district attorneys and advances our understanding of their decision-making.  I will utilize my independently constructed and novel dataset detailing the political careers of DAs--and will use Criminal Justice Administrative Records (CJARS) data --to determine criminal sentencing outcomes of the accused.

2809,Active,Targeting Homes with High Pb Exposure Risks by Leveraging Big Data and Advanced Machine-Learning Algorithms,Kentucky,2024,,Jacqueline MacDonald Gibson,"We aim to improve current methods for assessing Pb hazards and advance solutions related to 1) lack of integrated biological and environmental datasets, 2) lack of innovative cumulative and predictive risk assessment tools, 3) a feasible, convenient approach to identifying households for investigation and mitigation that can be scaled to expanded geographical areas, and 4) better protection of vulnerable populations and those living in affordable housing. Despite evidence that Pb exposure is still occurring in childhood homes, comprehensive and nationally applicable data and tools for identifying at-risk homes and communities are lacking.

Our project uses state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms and citizen science-based testing, paired with data sharing from community partners, to devise predictive Pb risk tools that bridge the gap between wondering about Pb household exposure risks and understanding the complete household Pb exposome. The results could greatly improve current methods for assessing and mitigating Pb hazards.

First, we will leverage existing big data sets as the foundation of our research, including biological data (approximately 100,000 childhood Pb blood levels from 2002-2019), soils data (464 residential Pb soil levels measured in Greensboro, NC, in 2018-2019), multimedia household Pb investigation data from 2002-2019 (from homes where Pb evaluations were previously conducted), household demographic and socioeconomic indicators (from ACS 2000-2020), water source and water quality information, and proximity to current and legacy Pb sources.

Second, we will advance residential risk assessment by using innovative, non-traditional methods that can identify how subtle differences in geography, household demographics, household structures, and environmental media contribute to Pb exposure risk across households. Traditional risk assessment methods often focus on one source of Pb exposure, such as paint, without evaluating the whole household exposome. Furthermore, additional factors, such as the role that household demographics play in Pb exposure, are omitted. Our Bayesian network modeling approach ensures that we pinpoint the range and likelihood of Pb exposure risks for children, and further, that we identify the importance of each risk factor and the relative Pb source contribution by household. The variability in our extensive data set will allow us to predict household variability in Pb exposure risk, as well as variability across cities or counties.

Third, we will validate our innovative risk assessment findings by conducting multi-media testing in households. We plan to adapt an existing award-winning online enrollment, citizen science training, and reporting approach available at www.cleanwaterforuskids.org which will also improve the ease of residential Pb assessment.

We also expect that the characteristics of teachers, such as their own education, measured by observing teachers located near children in the 1940 census, may matter to long term outcomes especially in rural areas where educated men and especially women were scarce.

Asymptotic spectral theory and computationally efficient procedures for understanding massive bipartite networks are also being developed.

In this project, we aim to investigate how hurricanes impact rental prices, rental housing stock, and household adaptation strategies. The effect of hurricane disasters on housing sale prices has been well documented. However, little is known about how housing costs change for renters, even though renters make up one-third of the US Population. We hypothesize that after a hurricane disaster: 1) rental prices increase, 2) supply of rental housing decreases, 3) renters and homeowners migrate at different rates, and 4) insurance attenuates the migratory responses of homeowners more than renters. To test our hypotheses, we plan to use American Community Survey data and American Housing Survey data to create a panel at the Census block group-level and household-level. We combine this panel data with IBTracs spatial hurricane data, as well as FEMA aid and insurance data. We use staggered difference-in-differences and an event study framework as our main specifications. We leverage hyper-specific data about hurricane tracks and wind speeds as a source of exogenous variation, comparing areas that were directly hit with a hurricane to comparable control areas. Importantly, we  account for common difference-and-differences issues at the forefront of the econometrics literature.

Specifically, we predict that firms with better corporate governance, lower cost of debt, more private equity or bank financing, and those in skill-intensive industries have higher poaching rates. Further, firms going public or getting acquired by more dispersedly owned firms will also become more likely to poach rather than hire from nonemployment. In terms of the implications of differential labor hiring strategies, we hypothesize that firms with higher poaching rates have less procyclical hiring costs, pay less procyclical wages, have more procyclical profits, and thus have higher expected stock returns. In addition, the technology investment of firms with higher poaching rates will be more sensitive to changes in technology price.

First, we will construct several measures of mismatch to characterize how mismatch varies by major and over the business cycle through a reduced form design. We anticipate earnings losses when mismatch increases. After estimating the reduced form results, we will build a search model to demonstrate how mismatch is generated through a labor demand shock.

To estimate the model, we will match aggregate moments from labor supply data on college graduates and labor demand data from Lightcast (formerly Burning Glass Technologies). We will use the ACS-NSCG data linked with the Master Address File to obtain information on recent college graduates.  We anticipate that a labor demand shock to one market will reallocate workers to other subsets of the labor market and generate mismatch, leading to lower welfare and wages.

We also contribute to the literature by producing estimates that account for measurement error when measuring social status, error that may vary across data sources. In addition to estimates of social mobility for the overall population, we will estimate how mobility varies by nativity status, which will contribute to understanding how economic assimilation has changed across immigration cohorts in the 19th Century, early 20th Century, and today.

2851,Active,The Impact of Natural Disasters on Business Dynamics,Baruch,2023,,Tarikua Erda,"Natural disasters are often said to create winners and losers due to their redistributive effect. Part of this redistribution may occur in the context of firm dynamics--an inherent feature of Schumpeterian creative destruction and of reallocation and growth. Yet, little is known about how (much) exactly natural disasters--exogenous yet powerful forces of destruction--affect firm dynamics, and how federal assistance factors into this process. Our research project aims to address this gap. Our preliminary work using publicly accessible data finds that US counties which experience at least one natural disaster see a pronounced increase in the number of new startups and a very small drop in the total number of businesses within the same year. Moreover, our analyses using the Small Business Administration's disaster assistance data show that disaster loans to businesses are associated with a substantial increase in new business formation, primarily by non-employer businesses. These preliminary results warrant further, detailed inquiry into the impact of disasters on broader business dynamics. Thus, we seek to combine restricted economic data from the US Census Bureau with disaster records from various sources to produce novel estimates of the impact of natural disasters on the number, survival, and productivity of startups and businesses in the US, to describe the heterogeneity and mechanisms of these impacts, as well as to examine the role of federal assistance in recovery. Examining a unique phenomenon at the nexus of disasters and business and labor dynamics, this research agenda stands to contribute meaningfully to the literature on firm dynamics as well as that on the economics of disasters, reallocation, and inequality.

Common ownership has been increasing in the U.S. in the past four decades, and this phenomenon raised the alarm that a small number of giant asset managers could effectively control most large, publicly traded firms in the near future. Increased common ownership could increase firms' employer market power, which in turn could contribute to the wage stagnation since the 1970s. Although this argument is theoretically appealing, little is known about whether and how common ownership affects employees and capital investment in reality. To achieve our goal, we merge microdata in the Census, for example, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Census of Manufactures (CMF), and Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), with institutional ownership data from SEC Form 13F. In addition to canonical panel regressions, we further use a firm's addition to the S&P 500 index as a shock to the common ownership of its competitors in local labor markets and use a matched difference-in-differences analysis to identify causal impacts of common ownership.

Yet, it is less known about to what extent different entrepreneurial frictions may affect the gap between large and small firms and what can be done to support small businesses. Given limited resources, small firms often face various frictions or barriers to technology, information, and investment opportunities. In this project, we propose to examine and quantify the effect of these frictions and explore approaches to reduce the gap between small and large firms.

Unlike large corporations, small firms often have limited resources to keep up with the latest technology, and information or adopt effective managerial practices, resulting in lower productivity and growth. To understand these factors on the performance of small firms and, ultimately, the gap between large and small firms, this project will examine whether small businesses that had access to technological innovations and innovative management knowledge had better business outcomes and a higher rate of survival than businesses that did not. In addition to the general effect, we will also examine the variation of effects by service type (i.e., technology implementation vs. training in managerial practices), firm type (i.e., size, age, or prior performance), and location (rural vs. urban; market concentration; competition, etc.). Our findings will offer insights to small manufacturing firms in the U.S. to identify the specific types of services that will result in better business outcomes and improve their ability to be competitive in the domestic and international markets.

Our preliminary findings suggest a permanent increase in local product-market concentration following positive shocks to government spending. We then develop a model in the spirit of Aghion and Howitt (1992) where competition discourages laggard firms from innovating but encourages neck-and-neck firms to innovate. Together with the effect of competition on the equilibrium industry structure, we provide the conditions under which a permanent increase in government spending leads to higher industry concentration.

Recent scholarship has discovered a growing gap between high-paying and low-paying employers; a second literature finds that firms have become more racially homogenous in the twenty-first century.

Summarizing this project's activities, after initial data linkages, we will develop descriptive analysis on the relationship between SNAP distribution dates and labor market and health outcomes. Then, this project will leverage program eligibility cutoffs for SNAP, and program policy variation in SNAP-Ed to causally identify the effect of SNAP/WIC on labor market (e.g., employment and income) and health outcomes (e.g., hospitalization and mortality). Despite the restricted-use micro-level SNAP/WIC datasets being non-comprehensive in terms of state-year coverage, we have identified several examples of program administration variation (with the state-years available) that we can leverage to estimate causal effects. For the sake of this proposal, we highlight a limited number of examples of SNAP and WIC administration variation that we will exploit for both descriptive and causal analyses. Specifically, we are interested in (1) variation in SNAP distribution dates and in certification period length, (2) variation in employment and age eligibility requirements, and (3) variation in SNAP-Ed program implementation. With (2), for example, some states reduce work requirements for individuals over 50, so we will compare otherwise-similar SNAP-participating households across the 50-year-old threshold to examine the effects of dropping the work requirement on employment (and other labor market and health outcomes). For WIC, we will conduct an analogous comparison based on the 5-year-old cutoff for children granting eligibility. Additionally, variation in certification periods will allow us to exploit the differential timing of reductions in SNAP benefits occurring from shorter recertification periods, rather than other unobserved factors. This will facilitate a powerful descriptive analysis, and we will explore the potential for estimating the causal effect of changes in SNAP benefit amounts resulting from the differential timing of recertification. Furthermore, the extensive longitudinal micro-level linkages will facilitate the examination of specific mechanisms for observed effects, such as educational attainment, family formation, migration, and hospitalization, all of which are testable.",23,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS) Food Security Data,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS_FS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement,CPSFS,State - SNAP and TANF - Connecticut,STATE_SNAPTANF_CT,State - SNAP and TANF - North Carolina,STATE_SNAPTANF_NC,State - SNAP and TANF - Nebraska,STATE_SNAPTANF_NE,State - SNAP and TANF - Nevada,STATE_SNAPTANF_NV,State - SNAP and TANF - South Carolina,STATE_SNAPTANF_SC,State - SNAP and TANF - South Dakota,STATE_SNAPTANF_SD,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - California LACO,STATE_SNAP_CA_LACO,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Illinois,STATE_SNAP_IL,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Maryland,STATE_SNAP_MD,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Montana,STATE_SNAP_MT,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Wyoming,STATE_SNAP_WY,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Colorado",STATE_WIC_CO,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Connecticut",STATE_WIC_CT,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Maine",STATE_WIC_ME,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Montana",STATE_WIC_MT,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - South Dakota",STATE_WIC_SD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Craig Carpenter,Thomas C Keene,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite death events being a common occurrence over virtually everyone's working lives, little is known about the consequences of the phenomenon for employment and organizational performance. Prior empirical work has been limited by available data, and prior empirical settings have relied upon small samples with potentially severe sampling selection bias (e.g., only considering a single occupation in a single city). While valuable, such analyses are significantly constrained in their ability to allow detailed examination and provide generalizability. This project seeks to better understand the consequences of this important and prevalent phenomenon. Several data sources will be linked at the individual- and establishment-/firm-levels, each of which contains measures relevant to execute the study. The researchers will also include publicly available external data on job characteristics, based on occupational codes from internal Census data, provided by O*NET. The proposed project will involve multivariate analyses, primarily using logistic regressions and OLS fixed effects regressions. This project will produce population estimates on how deaths of employees or the deaths of their loved ones may affect establishment/firm performance. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies of its kind, especially with large scale, administrative data, and will provide important, novel estimates on a phenomenon that everyone in the working population will experience at some point.",27,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,American Community Survey,ACS,Annual Integrated Economic Survey,AIES,Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs,ASE,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,National Survey of College Graduates,NSCG,National Survey of College Graduates Crosswalk,NSCG_XWALK,Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (formerly known as PCU),QPC,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Bryan Hong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of occupational mobility has, by contrast, languished because the available surveys are too small to reliably estimate recent trends. We are accordingly left with a shortage of evidence on (a) trends in occupational mobility, (b) cross-group differences in occupational mobility, and (c) the relationship between occupational mobility and other types of mobility (e.g., educational, economic). The National Research Council's (NRC) Standing Committee on Creating the American Opportunity Study has recommended that the Data Linkage Infrastructure (DLI), which links individuals across Decennial Censuses, the ACS, and the CPS, serve as the country's new data resource for monitoring occupation mobility. It is accordingly critical to understand the methodological costs and benefits of relying on the DLI for this purpose. We do so by ""stress testing"" the range of topics that occupational mobility researchers will want to carry out with this new infrastructure (e.g., trends in mobility; racial and ethnic variability in mobility; gender-based variability in mobility; family structure and mobility, and the relationship between economic, income, and education mobility). These analyses will be based on the 2007-21 American Community Surveys and the 2000 Decennial Census (as well as earlier Decennial Censuses insofar as the DLI completes their work with them and can make them available).",4,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Sofia Avila Jamesson,Joshua P Gagne,Renee Louis,Colin Peterson,Maxwell C Rong,Kimberly A Weeden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What explains variation in immigrants' integration choices? Although seminal theories in political science argue that military service is a critical driver of assimilation, some scholars have challenged the empirical basis and theoretical logic underpinning this relationship. A major obstacle bedeviling the study of military service and integration is self-selection: immigrants who are better assimilated may be more likely to join the military in the first place. We address the selection problem by examining the effects of military conscription during the Vietnam War using an instrumental variables approach. Conscription during the crucial years 1970-1972 was decided on the basis of national draft lotteries, which assigned draft numbers based on an individual's date of birth. We use the draft lottery to instrument for military service and estimate the causal effect of service on a range of integration outcomes using granular data from the decennial censuses. Our study thus contributes novel evidence to key debates on the implications of military service for assimilation and national identification, while also highlighting a potential role for public policy to encourage immigrant incorporation via national service.",5,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Melissa Desfor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While there are many programs and service available to address food insecurity, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the emergency food system, use of these resources differs between demographic groups. Urban/rural status is a key sociodemographic factor that influences food security and use of food assistance services, but publicly available measures of urban/rural status are imprecise. This study aims to understand relationships between food security, SNAP participation, and receipt of emergency food, and the rural-urban continuum before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we will link USDA Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes to 2015-2021 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement data. RUCA codes provide census-level tract measures of the urban/rural continuum that will allow for a granular examination of the role of urban/rural status plays in our outcomes of interest (food security, SNAP participation, and receipt of emergency food). We will produce weighted prevalences for each outcome and use multivariable logistic regression to examine the impact of time period (before versus during COVID-19 pandemic) and urban/rural status on each.

But little is known about household food insecurity dynamics, i.e., whether food insecurity is an outcome that households experience only transitorily, for short periods of time, or a more chronic state and for which households food insecurity is chronic versus transitory. We use a new synthetic panel estimation method (Dang et al. 2014), a data-driven approach to estimate dynamics when we cannot directly observe the same households over many time periods (as in panel data).  We adapt the existing method to the rotating panel sampling design in the Current Population Survey, in particular its Food Security Supplements (CPS-FSS). We generate a new food insecurity dynamics measure we developed, the probability of food security (PFS, Lee et al. 2022), by comparing observed household food expenditures to the food expenditures needed to avoid food insecurity, as reflected in the USDA's Cost of the Thrifty Food Plan estimates. Combining the new method and measure permits us to estimate indicators of food insecurity dynamics among US households from 2000-2021. Specifically, we will estimate the prevalence of short-run, transitory food insecurity and of long-run, chronic food insecurity. We will estimate spell lengths for periods of food insecurity and the share of the food insecure who are chronically versus transitorily, food insecure, in both national and state-specific samples.

2925,Active,How Much do Firm Differences Contribute to the Gender Pay Gap? Examining Gender Inequality across the Earnings Distribution from the 1990s-Present,Baruch,2023,,Greer Mellon,"After converging dramatically in the 1980s, the gender pay gap has only narrowed slightly since the mid-1990s, especially for highly skilled workers at the top of the earnings distribution. While there is growing evidence that firm-specific pay differences have played an important role in growing earnings inequality in the U.S. in recent decades, there has been less research on the contribution of firm-sorting to the continued gender pay gap. This project examines how much of the continued gender pay gap can be explained by differences between the employers that men and women work for (i.e., firm sorting). Our project will address four specific research questions: (1) How does the sorting of women and men between firms with different average individual-level earnings contribute to the gender pay gap? (2) Have pay differences between employers become an increasingly important explanatory factor for the gender pay gap between the 1990s and the present? (3) How does the contribution of firms to the gender pay gap vary, for
workers at different hierarchical positions in the earnings distribution? and (4) if employer differences between men and women are an important contributing factor to the gender pay gap, what factors are associated with the sorting of men and women between firms with different average individual-level earnings? We will focus on the role of childbirth events and work interruptions following childbirth. Our research has the potential to enable new understandings of the barriers that women face in reaching earnings parity with men.",16,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_SIPP,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Thomas A DiPrete,Greer Mellon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior research has found multiple negative associations between parental incarceration and children's well-being, extending well into young adulthood. However, research has been limited by small samples of children who have experienced parental incarceration within larger studies, and less attention has been paid to the consequences of a family member's conviction (without incarceration) or the influence of neighborhood context. This project will create new population estimates that fall in three broad research areas: 1) How children's exposure to household members' criminal justice contact (CJC) has varied over neighborhood and family context and time; 2) how children's exposure to familial CJC is associated with children's immediate household-level context, including levels of poverty and food insecurity; and 3) how children's exposure to familial CJC effects their outcomes in young adulthood, including educational attainment, economic mobility, and their own involvement in criminal justice systems.",19,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Best Race and Ethnicity Admin Records Modified,CENSUS_BESTRACE_NONRSTRCT,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,BOC PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_SIPP,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement,CPSFS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Household Pulse Survey,HH_PULSE_SURVEY,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,University of Michigan - CJARS,UM_CJARS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Naoka Carey,Rebekah L Coley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will then probe further hypotheses understanding how, and among whom, MTO affected mortality and fertility/birth, and neighborhood quality outcomes. To achieve this goal, our study proposes to link the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) for Fair Housing Study data with mortality data and fertility/birth data from the Social Security Numident data and the Census Household Composition Key File. Linkage to mortality records through 2021 will extend the follow up length 11 additional years beyond the last formal active follow up in the 2008-2010 MTO final survey, to inform two demographic events: birth and death. We will examine the longitudinal risk of death and birth, to the household head adults, as well as to the children who lived in the household at baseline in 1994-1997. This proposed study is cross-sector, interdisciplinary, and policy relevant, as housing vouchers represent the largest federal affordable housing investment. It is methodologically very strong, since the experimental design and random assignment is the gold standard for causal inference, and the MTO enrolled over 15,000 individuals in over 4000 families, in 5 different large US cities. This proposed study would test how interventions to address fundamental causes and social policy outside of the health sector has profound influences on two of important long-term population health outcomes: mortality and fertility.

Entrepreneurship research has grown rapidly as academics seek to investigate the role of start-ups in innovation and economic growth. Although job creation is one of the most important aspects of entrepreneurship, little is known about the relationships between regional variables and the early-stage hiring decisions of entrepreneurs. The proposed research aims to uncover which regional variables are related to entrepreneurial job creation in different geographies. In particular, five key regional variables could influence the propensity of entrepreneurs to hire workers: minimum wages, the duration of unemployment insurance benefits, Medicaid expansion, Job Creation Tax Credits, and homestead exemptions in personal bankruptcy law. These five regional variables vary across states and time, and minimum wages additionally vary across an increasing number of cities. The regional variables may affect entrepreneurs in different ways across communities that vary by wealth levels and racial and ethnic composition. To enhance our understanding of the large heterogeneity in entrepreneurial outcomes in the nationwide sample, the proposed project will analyze heterogeneous effects of the regional variables by demographic characteristics, which are measured at the levels of counties and zip codes.",2,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Frank M Fossen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine short-term mortality risks, we will identify coresident grandparents (and their caregiving responsibility) in the 2019-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) samples.

2947,Active,The effect of access to subsidized housing in the United States,Missouri,2023,,Brittany Street,"The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housed millions of people in the US since 1965, offering a critical piece of stability and offsetting the largest share of monthly expenses for these families. This paper studies the effect of access to affordable housing through HUD on employment, household structure, criminal activity, and mortality. To do so, we leverage three natural experiments, including the 1997 one-strike policy, openings and closing along with distance of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), and local waitlists along with restricted microdata through the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs). Our study will add to the existing literature by considering how HUD benefits affect short- to medium-term labor market outcomes, household structure, criminal justice contact, and mortality for adults and whether effects vary across racial and gender groups. We will also compare our results to the effects of other public programs using county-level rollouts in the later 1960s and 1970s, as a measure of increased access to non-housing subsidies. The project requires access to restricted microdata for two main reasons. First, public data does not allow for linking of people across HUD, labor market data, mortality data, and criminal justice datasets at the individual level to examine impacts of access to affordable housing. Second, public data does not allow for the linking of people within households to observe changes in household structure and the spillovers of HUD assistance to other members of the household on the listed socioeconomic outcomes. This project will use the Census Numident, Decennial and American Community Surveys, CJARS, LEHD, and the HUD Longitudinal Research file as well as the HUD PIC and TRACS enrollment files.

2956,Active,"Residential Property Valuation, Tax Exemptions, and Migration",Kentucky,2024,,William Hoyt,"Beginning with Oates (1969) There exists a voluminous literature in economics on the effects of property taxation on housing prices and, to a much less extent, on how property taxes affect locational decisions. That property taxes affect housing prices is, it has been argued by Oates and others, is an indication that households incorporate local public policies, taxes and public expenditures, into their decisions of where to reside as argued by Tiebout (1956). Further, the relationship between how property taxes and levels of public services each affect property values has been used in numerous studies to ascertain whether public services are efficiently provided or not (Oates (1969), Brueckner (1979, 1982), Barrow and Rouse (2004), and Bayer, Blair, and Whalley (2021) among others). What has been ignored in virtually all this literature, except for Banzhaf et al (2021), is the extensive number and variety of property tax exemptions provided by states. For households eligible for these exemptions, their tax payment, the product of the assessed value of their home and the local property tax (millage) rate, is not, in fact, the taxes they pay on their home but something less. That these exemptions vary among states and by taxpayer characteristics, most importantly age, suggest that households might change where they reside (which state or type of residence in which they reside (rental vs. owner-occupied) to take advantage of these exemptions.

2957,Active,Examining Interventions to Improve the Post-Release Outcomes of Incarcerated Individuals,Michigan,2023,,Nikhil Rao,"Individuals with criminal convictions face enormous difficulties upon release from incarceration facilities. In the United States, rates of recidivism are high and previously incarcerated individuals face well-documented barriers to employment (Alper, Durose and Markman 2018; Mueller-Smith 2015; Western, Kling and Weiman 2001). In response, correctional institutions and governments have established various interventions to help inmates re-integrate into society upon release. Most prison systems in the United States typically approach these issues from a labor-supply angle, offering a variety of training services for inmates, including basic education, vocational training, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). State legislation has focused on influencing labor demand by reducing firms' costs of hiring from this population or by reducing uncertainty about worker quality. While these interventions are increasingly common, there is little empirical evidence formally quantifying the benefits associated with them.
The goal of this study is to examine how labor supply- and demand-side forces that shape the development of cognitive and 'non-cognitive' (i.e. social and behavioral) skills affect labor market, public program, and crime outcomes for justice-involved individuals. We will use quasi-experimental variation generated by institutional features of prison systems and changes in state-level legislation to estimate the causal impacts of these types of interventions. We will also conduct heterogeneity analyses to understand how benefits vary by different subgroups and analyze how labor market conditions mediate these effects. We will do this by combining administrative prison records from CJARS, LEHD data, public program data (SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, etc), non-Census prison records, as well as a variety of survey data sources (Census, ACS, CPS, SIPP, etc).",23,American Community Survey,ACS,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC Best race and ethnicity administrative records file,CENSUS_BESTRACE,BOC Best Race and Ethnicity Admin Records Modified,CENSUS_BESTRACE_NONRSTRCT,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk CPS School Enrollment Supplement,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPSSCHOOL,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS) Food Security Data,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS_FS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Census Household Composition Key File,CENSUS_HH_COMP_KEY,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement,CPSFS,CPS School Enrollment Supplement,CPSSCHOOL,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,University of Michigan - CJARS,UM_CJARS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Nikhil Rao,James M Reeves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has implications for first and second generation immigrants as financial mobility is limited. This study aims to assess the levels of financial participation for immigrants, as well as intergenerational financial mobility. To assess the level of financial participation, we will estimate banking rates, access to credit and total number of investments. We will consider the extent to which Latin Americans own and use financial products and services, in comparison to US native born, and study the evolution of these financial inclusion gaps over time.

The project will analyze these topics through the lens of two populations that have potentially costly access to entrepreneurship and standard work: immigrants and justice-impacted individuals. Both immigrants and justice-impacted individuals face various frictions in both the labor market and the ability to engage in entrepreneurship - frictions such as regulation and discrimination, credit market frictions, and social and cultural barriers. Yet, both groups are important sources of new firms in the United States. The researchers will exploit the various frictions faced by these groups to better understand the entrepreneurial process, asking under what circumstances these populations start and grow businesses and affect their local economies, and ultimately how the Census Bureau can better capture outcomes for young businesses founded by these groups.

Tom Mueller,"Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, wherein states have the option to expand Medicaid coverage to adults with household incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, has been shown to reduce mortality rates nationwide. From 2014 to 2018, mortality rates dropped 3.6% more in states that expanded Medicaid than those that did not. Although the impact of Medicaid expansion on mortality is well-documented, its impact on mortality disparities remains underexamined. The overarching goal of this study is to identify the relationship between Medicaid expansion and rural-urban ethnoracial disparities, while also estimating the mediating role of poverty alleviation in this relationship. The project will be completed through three specifics aims. The first to be completed outside of the RDC, and the second two to be completed within the RDC. In Aim 1, we will estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on ethnoracial mortality disparities by rural-urban status from 2011 to 2019. We will do so using time-varying difference-in-difference design with marginal prediction analysis via census data and restricted data from the National Vital Statistics System. In Aim 2, we will improve the cost-of-living adjustment in the existing Supplemental Poverty Measure and estimate the improved measure at the county level from 2011 to 2019. As detailed in our Methodology, we will do so using restricted American Community Survey data, alongside the SPM-ACS estimates generated by Fox et al. (2020), to create a county-specific cost-of-living adjustment and corresponding county-specific and county-sensitive poverty estimates. In Aim 3, we will bring estimates of all-cause mortality generated via restricted CDC data into the RDC to estimate the mediating role of poverty reduction in the relationship between Medicaid expansion and rural-urban ethnoracial mortality disparities from 2009 to 2019.

2978,Active,Mothers' Work Schedules and Children's Participation in Early Care and Education,Wisconsin,2024,,Alejandra Pilarz,"Mothers' employment in jobs with nonstandard schedules has been associated with adverse child cognitive and academic outcomes. A key pathway via which these associations are hypothesized to operate is children's participation in early care and education. Working during nonstandard times is expected to limit the use of formal early care and education (ECE) programs because the times during which parents need care are mismatched with these programs' weekday, daytime schedules. Formal ECE tends to be higher-quality than care provided in home-based settings and has been associated with more positive child cognitive and academic skills. Although prior correlational studies find an association between mothers' work schedules and children's participation in formal ECE, two recent studies suggest that mothers' nonstandard schedules are not necessarily associated with a lower likelihood of using formal ECE, depending on child age and family structure. Using nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the purpose of this study is to examine trends in children's participation in ECE programs from 1996 to 2020 and estimate associations between mothers' work schedules and children's ECE participation, including examining heterogeneity in these associations by child age, family demographic characteristics, and county-level characteristics. Further, this study will use county-level labor market and economic indicators as instruments for mothers' work hours and schedules to provide evidence of causal associations between mothers' work schedules and children's ECE participation.",1,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Alejandra Pilarz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2981,Active,"Composition of external finance, information, and firm ownership",Wisconsin,2023,,Dean Corbae,"This paper investigates the effects of firm ownership and information disclosure regulation on the composition and costs of external financing for private and public (listed) US firms. Theoretical literature has shown that private information affects firm's capital structure, borrowing costs, and could result in capital misallocation (e.g. DeMarzo and Fishman (RFS, 2007), Holmstrom and Tirole (QJE, 1997)). Still there has been limited empirical evidence for the effects of private information due to absence of mandatory disclosure in private companies on firm's financial and real outcomes. This paper takes a novel approach in which it differentiates between information environments of private and public companies using firm-level administrative dataset, the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR), which covers a large sample of manufacturing, mining, retail, and wholesale trade firms since 1977. First, this paper uses the QFR merged with other publicly available databases (CRSP-Compustat and others) to decompose external financing used for investment into debt issuance (e.g bank vs non-bank debt, short-term vs long-term debt), equity issuance and sales of financial assets for privately and publicly owned companies in the US. Second, it estimates the relative contribution of private ownership and access to corporate debt markets to the components of external financing, controlling for firm specific observable characteristics. Third, this paper quantitatively evaluates the effects of changes in disclosure regulation on the costs of external financing for private and public firms using difference-in-difference analysis. Finally, the paper sheds light on the relationship between firm ownership and external funds volatility through the differences in debt maturity structure.",1,Quarterly Financial Report,QFR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Dean Corbae,Ekaterina Kazakova,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do so, we use data from the National Survey of College Graduates to compare the earnings of students who double major with earnings of peers who graduated from the same institution and who are observationally similar but single major instead. To address concerns that students sort into major type (double versus single) along unobserved characteristics that may affect labor market outcomes, we use a partial identification method to obtain bounded estimates for the causal effect of double majoring, which accounts for the role of selection on unobserved characteristics.

To document the causal effect, we will exploit time-series variation in the restrictiveness of creditor collection practices across states. Stronger creditor restrictions reduce debt recovery rates, which ultimately make creditors reduce credit supply. We hypothesize that stronger creditor restrictions negatively affect entrepreneurial activities, due to the following two mechanisms. First, stronger restrictions make it harder for entrepreneurs to borrow money from creditors, which could inhibit their abilities to launch or maintain businesses. Second, stronger restrictions also influence credit supply for local customers, which could lower the demand for products and services. This project includes three sub-questions. First, we will utilize the QFR to measure firm debt structure and investigate whether there is a reduction in unsecured debt when lenders face more restrictions. Next, we will obtain measures of firms' revenue from the SAS/ARTS/LBD and test whether more restrictions hurt firms' revenue. Finally, we will use establishment-level LBD data to explore how multi-segment firms with establishments in different regions react to changes in creditor restrictions.

3002,Active,"Childhood Poverty, EITC, and the Criminal Justice System: Can an early intervention prevent Criminal Justice System Involvement?",UCLA,2023,,Danielle Sobol,"A central goal of criminal justice reform initiatives is to reduce the number of people whose lives are altered by the justice system, often by reducing justice system involvement. The majority of policies that work to this end - for example: diversion efforts or sentencing reform - focus on interventions within the system itself. Such policies the fail to address the root causes, structural inequalities, and institutional contexts that lead to criminal justice system involvement in the first place. Poverty is a significant root cause of criminal justice system interaction and growing up in poverty is directly associated with a host of risk factors for justice system involvement. This research explores how the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a safety net benefit that has been associated with substantial declines in childhood poverty rates, might protect an individual from the life-changing negative consequences of the justice system in adulthood. It investigates the questions: Do policies that reduce childhood poverty prevent subsequent involvement in the criminal justice system? For whom might such policies prevent involvement, by how much, and what crimes might be affected?

The analysis will take two approaches to exploring the value of EITC as an early intervention. The first will exploit state-level generosity in supplemental EITC benefits to estimate the impact of high-level policy variation on all children. The second will focus on children in EITC beneficiary households and, similarly, exploit variation in state EITC policy to estimate the effects of marginal increases in benefits. Both analyses will utilize childhood data from the Current Population Survey - Annual Social and Economic Supplement data (CPS-ASEC) linked with adult criminal justice outcomes from The Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). Analyses will explore heterogeneous effects by race in order to identify for whom the EITC might mitigate the consequences of childhood poverty on criminal justice system interaction and how that might impact racial disparity in the justice system, as well as effects by gender and age cohort to explore how benefits or information campaigns can be best targeted. The final scholarly product will be a dissertation and a journal article. As governments consider the critical goal of criminal justice system reform, this research can offer insight into a social policy, rather than a justice system policy, that targets a root cause of criminal justice system interaction and that could provide a policy lever to reduce inequality.",6,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_CPS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey-ASEC (CPS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Current Population Survey March Supplement,CPS,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,University of Michigan - CJARS,UM_CJARS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Philip O Armour,Danielle Sobol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a method to identify the sources of this cyclical variation in hiring risk by estimating firm-specific discount rates using establishment-level panel data. Our method relates measures of labor intensity (e.g., the labor share) to previous and future hiring rates and uses Euler equations to connect the estimated coefficient to discount rates. We implement our method using restricted-use microdata from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). Cost information comes from the Economic Census and annual surveys, and balance sheet data comes from the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR). Lastly, we project the estimated discount factor on firms' characteristics, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms at play. We show that financial frictions are crucial for understanding cyclical fluctuations in unemployment, specifically for small firms that depend on banking lending.

3012,Active,"Merger Impacts on Productivity, Markups, and Beyond",Georgetown,2023,,Cameron W Healy,"While a wealth of research has addressed the question of how mergers and acquisitions (M&A) impact ag-
gregate productivity and welfare in an economy, studies thus far have failed to ascertain microeconomic
information critical to the modeling of merger impacts on a macroeconomic scale. Existing studies have
either restricted analysis of mergers' effects to a single bespoke industry or have suffered econometric prob-
lems. Therefore, past research has not identified generalizable impacts of mergers on firm-level markup and
productivity in manufacturing (or any other sector). We provide contribution by identifying productivity in
merger-rich sectors' firms by combining a parametric production function estimator, a robust law of motion
for productivity that incorporates acquisition history, and econometric adjustments to the proxy function
approach that renders the method appropriate for quinquennial census data. We then identify impact of
mergers on markups through firm- and market-level output demand elasticities, and then leverage matched
difference-in-differences to identify shocks to productivity induced by said mergers. By combining a diverse
set of census datasets with Thomson/Refinitiv's SDC Platinum M&A dataset, we are able to draw novel and
wide-ranging conclusions about impact of mergers in six diverse industries in the United States Economy's

3018,Active,Estimates of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Employment and Wages,Maryland,2024,,Ethan D Kaplan,"This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by producing population estimates examining the impact of Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) generosity on employment and wages. Utilizing merged Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data with other internal Census Bureau demographic datasets, the researchers will both reassess the existing literature on employment effects and provide credible estimates of the effect of this refundable tax credit on hourly wages. Two main identification difficulties exist for estimating the effects of the EITC - controlling for the effects of the economic environment and controlling for unobservable heterogeneity across individuals. The researchers will attempt to solve the first of these problems by utilizing local geographic variation in state EITC supplements across state borders after 2000. Using local geographic variation will allow the research to sidestep ongoing debates about the potential confounding effects of welfare reform and the booming economy during the major EITC reforms of the 1990s. In addition, the researchers will simultaneously match individuals with similar demographics and work histories to attempt to better control for individual heterogeneity as the LEHD contains individual-level variables which are not observable in other datasets. The ability to simultaneously control for the local economy (using local geographical variation in treatment) and simultaneously control for individual selection (by matching on wage and employment histories plus demographics) is feasible only with the LEHD data and will be best achieved by linking those data to the American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and/or Current Population Survey - Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). In addition to the LEHD data, the researchers also request access to these latter three datasets, associated Protected Identification Key (PIK) crosswalks with which to link between these datasets, and Numerical Identification (Numident) file data with which to identify deaths (pertinent events in the LEHD data that are not otherwise observable). The Master Address File-Auxiliary Reference File (MAF-ARF) and MAF Extract File (MAFX) are requested to provide more detailed information about housing units.

3019,Active,"Incarceration and mortality in the United States, 2008-2015",Stanford,2023,,Mathew V Kiang,"Approximately 1.8 million adults in the U.S. are incarcerated in jails and prisons; another 3.7 million are on probation or parole (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2021), and many more have had previous involvement in the correctional system. The incarcerated population is both a socially vulnerable and a legally protected population. There is overrepresentation of socially minoritized populations among incarcerated individuals including populations with lower levels of education, Black or Hispanic race, mental health disorders, and substance abuse disorders (Collateral Costs: Incarceration's Effect on Economic Mobility, 2010, 2017; Freudenberg, 2002; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2020; Travis et al., 2014). What is more, history of incarceration can be a barrier to employment, healthcare, and social inclusion (Travis et al., 2014) The purpose of this proposal is to quantify the impact of incarceration on mortality and to compare the leading causes of death by incarceration status. The Mortality Disparities in American Communities (MDAC) dataset links 2008 American Community Survey records with National Death Index records from 2008-2015 resulting in a study population of 4,512,376 individuals. Using MDAC data, we will identify incarceration status of individuals 18 years or older at the 2008 ACS completion and will use statistical matching of demographic characteristics to match incarcerated and non-incarcerated individuals to increase the comparability of the groups. Using the matched cohort, we will compare all-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality rates by incarceration status and will further compare these rates to the U.S. general population using CDC WONDER data to calculate rates for the general population. Finally, we propose using survival models to estimate the probability of survival during the 7-year follow-up period and to assess differences in survival by incarceration status. We hypothesize that individuals who were incarcerated in 2008 will have an increased rate of all-cause mortality as compared to individuals who were not incarcerated in 2008. Further we hypothesize that individuals incarcerated in 2008 will be more likely to die from alcohol-related deaths, drug overdose, and suicide - a trio sometimes referred to as ""deaths of despair"" in epidemiologic research (Case & Deaton, 2015; Scutchfield & Keck, 2017).",4,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,Mortality Disparities in American Communities,MDAC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Mathew V Kiang,Esther Velasquez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will also prepare estimates of population and characteristics of population as authorized under Title 13, Chapter 5. In particular, the project will verify information contained in the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data set and American Community Survey (ACS) data set. It will also generate new estimates of characteristics of population as described below. The researchers will use individual address information (available down to individual's census block, tract, and ZIP code) contained in the credit bureau data to verify employee address information in the LEHD. In addition, the researchers will use information on identity theft and fraud provided in the credit bureau data to verify the LEHD data at the time of such incidents. Finally, the credit data include mortgage information for each individual (including payments, balance, delinquency), which will be used to verify ACS mortgage data (which is allocated at higher rates) and provide the Census with methods to improve the quality of these data.

This research project seeks to examine the effects of debt overhang on individual labor outcomes, as well as new business creation and growth. As a result of these analyses, we will provide the Census Bureau with new estimates of population characteristics not available and examined in the existing literature. We define debt overhang in a few different ways. First, we would like to examine how a high and growing student debt burden affects earnings, job search, and entrepreneurial activity of individual borrowers. Second, we would like to examine how changes to mortgage payment schedules (because of loan modifications, forbearance, or interest rate changes) can affect homeowners' mobility decisions, labor supply, earnings and entrepreneurial outcomes. Third, we would like to use credit bureau data on third-party collections, tax liens, and wage garnishments to examine how creditors' adverse legal actions and collection practices, which effectively reduce take-home pay for affected individuals, change individual labor supply, overtime work, and attachment to the labor market.

3031,Active,Linking the National Survey of College Graduates to Census Bureau Employer Data,Triangle,2024,,Darryl Cooney,"This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau as it generates population estimates during the  process of: (1) improving the linkage methodology for two types of Census Bureau-collected surveys; (2) linking currently unlinked data from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) to the Census Bureau's internal business data, providing new information on foreign-born scientists and engineers; and (3) comparing two parallel linking processes for matching the NSCG data to the Census Bureau's business data and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program data.
The researchers will use both direct and probabilistic entity resolution (i.e., record linkage) to match employer information in the NSCG to U.S. Census Bureau employer records, using data from the LEHD and County Business Patterns Business Register (CBPBR) for employer matching. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) will be used to assist with the matching effort, especially in terms of tracking establishments and firms over time. Links between the NSCG and LBD/CBPBR will be performed probabilistically based on employer information reported in the NSCG. Links between the NSCG and LEHD data will be made directly at the employee-level using Protected Identification Key (PIK) information available in both data sources. For cases where a PIK match can be made,  the accuracy of these ""employee"" matches can be straightforwardly compared at employer-level since both linking processes can be employed side-by-side. Correspondingly, one Census benefit of the project will be the comparison of the accuracy for the two methods as well as verification of one process (when possible) through use of the other. The end result will ultimately enable data-driven analysis of foreign-born scientist and engineer (FBSE) employment in the context of immigration status, degree fields, and industry sectors, improving the analytic utility of the NSCG data for future users. Moreover, the Census Bureau's LEHD and LBD data, as well as other business data that can be linked to the LBD, will be enhanced going forward through the ability to link those data sources to the NSCG. The researchers will provide the Bureau with a technical memorandum summarizing the results of the linking process, and comparisons made during that process, to summarize the benefits provided.
The effort will link databases utilizing the approach of d-blink, which proposes a scalable unsupervised joint approach for blocking and entity resolution. This approach will handle missing information and will be more accurate in situations where firm ownership, names or addresses change over time. The d-blink approach can also simultaneously merge more than two databases, is based on Bayesian methods and is less sensitive to the choice of matching threshold and will provide uncertainty quantification from the entity resolution process. In contrast to existing methods for canonicalization, our proposed approach does not rely on training data and can handle categorical, ordinal, and numerical attributes. By performing each stage--entity resolution, canonicalization, and downstream task--in a Bayesian framework, uncertainty is propagated throughout and properly accounted for when reaching final conclusions. This statistical solution will enable data-driven analysis of foreign-born scientist and engineer (FBSE) employment in the context of their immigration status, degree fields, and the industry sectors in which they are employed. The research will ultimately improve the analytic utility of the NSCG data for Census Bureau stakeholders, both internal and external.",17,BOC Census Numident (CNUM),CENSUS_CNUM,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,LEHD Person-Level Residence (Workers Only; ICF Residence),LEHD_RESIDENCE,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,National Survey of College Graduates,NSCG,National Survey of College Graduates Crosswalk,NSCG_XWALK,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Supplementary Public Data - County Characteristics,PUBLIC_COUNTY,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Jennifer Ozawa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This central question to corporate finance has been largely examined for public firms, but less studied for private firms due to data constraints. Using confidential Census microdata and various shocks to firm financing from lenders (in the form of traditional lending like the SBA 504 or 7(a) program), venture capital funds, and private equity funds, we provide a coherent picture of firms' financing and how this affects their life cycle. Additionally, we measure how firm financing affects market power. While market power may be driven by multiple sources, we hypothesize that financing scarcity may boost established firms' market power by preventing entry. Lastly, we examine the rise in earning inequality through the lens of market power. Specifically, we look at firm wages and the impact regulatory costs have on firms.

3044,Active,"Human Resources, Natural Resources, and the Location of Individuals and Economic Activity in Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan Areas",Penn State,2023,,Luyi Han,"Regional economic development crucially depends on human resources and natural resources.  In particular, highly-educated professionals and entrepreneurs are expected to have important effects creating local jobs and increasing incomes and well-being for themselves and others.  Primary, secondary, and higher education institutions help build, attract, and retain local human capital, but access to high-quality education institutions varies considerably across geographic areas and lack of educational access is expected to especially hinder non-metropolitan areas and smaller metropolitan areas.  Furthermore, natural resources play an important role in job creation for less densely populated areas.  However, some natural resources may enhance human resources, while other natural resources may hinder the creation and retention of human capital.  For example, mountains, lakes, and parks may be especially attractive natural amenities that attract and retain skilled workers and entrepreneurs, while oil and gas fracking activity creates jobs but also environmental disamenities that may push away skilled workers and entrepreneurs that are vital for long-run economic development.  We propose to investigate these and related issues to better understand how human resources and natural resources shape regional economic activity using restricted access microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2000 decennial census long-form surveys.  Restricted access data are critical for this analysis because publicly available microdata do not identify counties with population less than 100,000 and do not identify the specific county where individuals were born.

3054,Active,Early Childhood Education and Long-Run Outcomes,Michigan,2024,,Jordan Berne,"Public early childhood education (ECE) expanded rapidly beginning in the 1980s. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of states funding preschool rose from 4 to 30. Importantly, these programs differed on a number of dimensions from the smaller, much-studied programs of the 1960s and 1970s. Enough time has now passed that we can begin to examine the long-run outcomes of the participants of public ECE in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. We hypothesize that participants will have better long-run outcomes (educational attainment, employment, earnings, etc.) than non-participants, although the differences may be smaller than those between individuals born in the 1960s and 1970s. To understand any observed differences, we will also examine the short- and medium-run mechanisms (parental employment, family earnings, etc.) that mediate children's long-run outcomes. Our analyses will use a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework, the synthetic control method (SCM), and regression discontinuity (RD) designs, as applicable.

But some scholars have emphasized that certain administrative procedures support, rather than burden, program participants. We investigate this potential tradeoff in the context of physical presence requirements in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Opponents of physical presence requirements in WIC emphasize their disenrollment effects, while proponents argue they provide WIC participants with important information and referrals to other resources. Using restricted SIPP and WIC administrative records, merged with restricted SNAP, TANF and CPS FSS files, we exploit geographic and time variation in the use of physical presence requirement waivers among local WIC agencies during COVID-19 to examine their effects on program participation outcomes, emergency nutrition assistance and healthcare use. To investigate whether physical presence requirements preclude program uptake, we first estimate whether WIC enrollment increased following the availability of in-person requirement waivers for waiver counties relative to nonwaiver counties. Next, we examine whether WIC enrollees in waiver counties were less likely to redeem WIC benefits, participate in SNAP or TANF, receive emergency food assistance, or utilize healthcare. If in-person appointments support connecting WIC enrollees to other resources, we should find that waivers reduced WIC benefit redemption, multiple program participation, and emergency food assistance and healthcare use.",24,BOC Consolidated PIK Crosswalk Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),CENSUS_CONSXWALK_SIPP,BOC PIK Crosswalk Current Population Survey (CPS) Food Security Data,CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CPS_FS,BOC Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_MARF,Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement,CPSFS,Master Address File Extract,MAFX,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panels,SIPP,State - SNAP and TANF - Connecticut,STATE_SNAPTANF_CT,State - SNAP and TANF - Iowa,STATE_SNAPTANF_IA,State - SNAP and TANF - South Dakota,STATE_SNAPTANF_SD,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Arizona,STATE_SNAP_AZ,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Colorado,STATE_SNAP_CO,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Illinois,STATE_SNAP_IL,State - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - Montana,STATE_SNAP_MT,State - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) - Arizona,STATE_TANF_AZ,State - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) - Montana,STATE_TANF_MT,"State - Women, Infants and Children (WIC) - Arizona",STATE_WIC_AZ,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Colorado",STATE_WIC_CO,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Connecticut",STATE_WIC_CT,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Illinois",STATE_WIC_IL,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Kansas",STATE_WIC_KS,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Maine",STATE_WIC_ME,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Montana",STATE_WIC_MT,"State - Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - South Dakota",STATE_WIC_SD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,William C Fannin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3061,Active,"The Impact of Union Presence, Employee Ownership, and Employment Protection Policies on Productivity, and Minority and Women's Earnings and Employment",Boston,2024,,Fidan A Kurtulus,"This project will combine the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service data set on collective bargaining agreement expiration notices (i.e. FMCS F-7 files), the Department of Labor Form 5500 data set on employee ownership at firms (F5500), and data on state adoption of employment protection policies, with the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Longitudinal Employment-Household Dynamics (LEHD), and Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) available from the U.S. Census. By doing so, this project will produce population level estimates of the effect of establishment union presence and employee ownership on workplace racial and gender equity by examining effects on minority and women workers' earnings, earnings gaps, employment levels, and employment representation, as well as on workplace productivity, governance, and ownership structures.  We will test the hypothesis that establishments with unions or employee ownership will exhibit greater gender and racial equity in employment levels, earnings levels and earnings gaps, and employment representation. We will also investigate the degree to which the impact of union presence and employee ownership interact with employment protection policy in the form of wrongful discharge laws and state antidiscrimination laws. For example, do establishments which are unionized and/or covered by employee ownership plans experience less of an impact from state employment protection laws, reflecting that these policies counteract, rather than reinforce, each other? In this case, the interactive effect between employment protection laws and union presence/employee ownership may demonstrate that union membership and/or employee-ownership provides greater preexisting worker voice, so employment protection policies, which also empower workers, provide less impact in these setting. Therefore, employment protection policies would have their greatest impact in non-employee-owned and/or nonunionized workplaces.

We will also test whether unionized workplaces may have greater levels of employee-ownership/participation, and whether these interventions reinforce each other in terms of promoting workplace racial and gender employment equity, workplace improvements in productivity, and improved organizational and management practices that foster less centralized decision-making within firms.  

This project is the first to investigate the relationship between union presence and firm management and decision-making dynamics with a focus on comparing outcomes in innovative employee-owned/participatory workplace structures versus traditional top-down investor-owned governance structures using data from the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) and U.S. Department of Labor Form 5500 Annual Returns/Reports of Employee Benefit Plans.",15,Annual Integrated Economic Survey,AIES,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Form 5500 Bridge File,F55BF,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,LEHD Person-Level Demographics (Workers Only; ICF demographics),LEHD_DEMO,"LEHD Employer-Level Files (ECF, SPF, QWI; non-T26)",LEHD_EMPLOYERS,LEHD Employer-Level File T26 (ECF; T26),LEHD_EMPLOYERS_T26,"LEHD Job-Level Files (EHF, JHF)",LEHD_JOBS,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Eric Hoyt,Fidan A Kurtulus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will also explore differences in financing and outcomes for minority- and women-owned, innovative, and food retail businesses. Limited access to credit restricts the ability of rural businesses to be economically viable, and retain and generate jobs, effects that are compounded in minority neighborhoods and rural underserved communities. The data we use for the project include the entrepreneurship surveys such as the Annual Business Survey linked to core Census business datasets including the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Census. We explore the variations in financial capital between rural and urban areas, and for minority and women owned small businesses. We also investigate the role of innovation in rural businesses as it relates to financial capital access, the extent to which financing constraints on entrepreneurship inhibit the availability of local food retail businesses in underserved communities, and the ability of federal rural programs to overcome financial market failures due to informational asymmetries.",29,Annual Business Survey,ABS,American Community Survey,ACS,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs,ASE,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Construction Industries,CCN,Census Edited File,CEF,Decennial Census,CEN,BOC PIK Crosswalk American Community Survey (ACS),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_ACS,BOC PIK Crosswalk Census Unedited File (CUF),CENSUS_CROSSWALK_CUF,"Census of Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",CFI,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Mining,CMI,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Census of Services,CSR,"Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities",CUT,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Supplementary Public Data - Geographic Codes,GEO_CODES,Integrated Longitudinal Business Database,ILBD,Supplementary Public Data - Industry and Product Codes,IND_PROD_CODES,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data PIK Crosswalk,IP_INVENTOR_CROSSWALK,Intellectual Property Public Patent Data - No PII,IP_PUBLIC_NOPII,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Supplementary Public Data - Price Indices,PRICE_INDICES,Survey of Business Owners,SBO,Standard Statistical Establishment Listing,SSL,USDA Rural Establishment Innovation Survey (REIS),USDA_REIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,James C Davis,Luyi Han,Anil Rupasingha,Zheng Tian,Timothy Wojan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3067,Active,Firm Behavior to Dual Minimum Wage Policies,Chicago,2024,,Pietro Pellerito,"The minimum wage is a significant economic topic considering how many people and firms are impacted by the policy, and therefore is an important topic of study for economists. One type of minimum wage policy that has yet to be studied in depth are ""dual minimum wage systems"", which mandate higher minimum wages for larger firms. Dual minimum wage policies have been enacted in several states, including Illinois, New Jersey, and most recently California. In our proposed paper, we seek to answer the question ""how do firms respond to dual minimum wage policies?"" Specifically, we are interested in how firms change their labor supply in response to these policies by estimating the wage elasticity of labor using two types of bunching estimators. The first bunching estimator is taken from Kleven and Waseem (2013), where the number of excess firms utilizing labor below the kink is estimated by fitting a counterfactual wage schedule with a high order polynomial. From the number of bunching firms, as well as the increase in minimum wage pay at the kink, the wage elasticity supply of labor can be estimated. The second bunching estimator uses a differences-in-differences model to estimate the number of bunching firms at the kink, rather than estimating the counterfactual distribution with a polynomial. Specifically, we will use both these strategies to estimate the wage elasticity of labor in the manufacturing sector using ASM/CM and ABS data for years prior to 2023, and AIES data for the years 2023 and 2024. Though we hypothesize that firms will respond to ""dual minimum wage policies"" by reducing labor usage, labor frictions may prevent firms from doing so immediately or altogether. A benefit of our second estimation strategy is that we will also be able to observe how firms are changing their labor usage in response to these policies over time, further contributing to our understanding of how firms respond to ""dual minimum wage systems."" Though the focus of our paper is on estimating the wage elasticity of labor, it is likely that firms are also changing the usage of other inputs in response to ""dual minimum wage policies"" as well. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we plan to study how firms change their usage of these inputs in response to these policies. This later analysis will access input changes in response to dual minimum wage exposure in the manufacturing, service, and retail industries using ASM/CM and ABS datasets (respectively) for years prior to 2022, as well as the AIES for years 2023 and 2024. Finally, we evaluate the consistency of data collection as the Census moves from collecting firm data using multiple surveys (including the ASM, ARTS, and SAS) to the singular AIES. Using a difference in differences methodology, we will see if any of the key variables collected in these survey are changing from 2022 (the last year before switching to the AIES) to 2023 onward.",7,Annual Business Survey,ABS,Annual Integrated Economic Survey,AIES,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,Service Annual Survey,SAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Ethan Jenkins,Pietro Pellerito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3069,Active,Productivity and Distortions,Berkeley,2024,,James Traina,"This project delves into the intricate dynamics of distortions and their impact on productivity measurement across diverse sectors, including manufacturing, trade, and services. Leveraging the granularity of restricted-use microdata, this study employs a novel micro-econometric approach to uncover productions functions, productivity estimates, and distortions. The central hypothesis of the research is that distortions significantly influence productivity measurements, with these influences varying across sectors due to the specific types of distortions prevalent in each market. Additionally, this study posits several secondary hypotheses for testing: distortions may be larger in service sectors compared to manufacturing and trade sectors; less capital-intensive industries may exhibit different manifestations and sensitivities to distortions; and the impact of distortions on productivity may be moderated by firm-specific factors such as size, age, and management practices. The final analysis will provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between distortions and productivity. The findings are expected to contribute to the broader discourse on productivity measurement and distortions, improving Census estimates of sectoral productivity.",16,Annual Capital Expenditures Survey,ACE,Annual Retail Trade Survey,ARTS,Annual Survey of Manufactures,ASM,Annual Wholesale Trade Survey,AWTS,Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD),BERD,Census of Manufactures,CMF,Census of Retail Trade,CRT,Compustat-SSEL Bridge,CSB,Census of Services,CSR,Census of Wholesale Trade,CWH,Supplementary Public Data - Economic Indicators and Other Industry Metrics,ECON_INDICATORS,Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue,LBDREV,NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Public Use Dataset),NBERCES_PUBLIC,Quarterly Financial Report Census Years,QFRCEN,Service Annual Survey,SAS,Survey of Industrial Research and Development,SIRD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,Anton Bobrov,James Traina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3072,Active,"Residential segregation, zoning, and housing production: Bringing housing supply-side actors into the study of residential segregation",Baruch,2024,,Yana A Kucheva,"This project investigates the reciprocal relationship between residential segregation and the housing landscape--the geographic mix of different tenure types and densities of housing across metropolitan areas. In so doing, the project shifts the focus of segregation research from the demand-side--the renters and homeowners vying for places to live--to the supply side: the landlords, developers, and municipal agencies who transform the housing landscape by permitting, building, renovating, converting, and selling housing. Our goal is to understand how development decisions made by municipal housing agencies, city planners, politicians, developers, and landlords shape housing opportunities, influence patterns of residential mobility, and, in turn, guide processes of residential segregation with respect to race and income. 
This project will combine statistical analyses of household mobility coming from the American Community Survey (ACS) data with urban planning zoning data at either the metropolitan or neighborhood level to implement policy relevant simulations of the housing market that examine the co-evolutionary process linking the segregation of the population to the shifting spatial distribution of the housing landscape.",1,American Community Survey,ACS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,Yana A Kucheva,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this, we will utilize multi-year cohort data, specifically the American Community Survey (ACS) linked to Census Numident mortality follow-up data, the Mortality Disparities in American Communities (MDAC), and the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) - each dataset has a unique combination of mortality data, risk factors, follow-up time, and sample size. The datasets will be discretized by mortality follow-up, with each year having a multi-cohort sample and corresponding survey weight adjustment. Weighted discrete time-to-event Poisson regression within an age-period-cohort analysis framework will be used to estimate yearly mortality rates.
We will explore the contribution of risk factors to the change in mortality rates over time and between birth cohorts.
