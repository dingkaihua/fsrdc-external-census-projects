# fsrdc-external-census-projects
At Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs), researchers use restricted-access microdata to address important research questions.  An Excel spreadsheet containing metadata about active and completed projects, including project title, abstract, FSRDC location, principal investigator, year project started, researchers, and datasets requested in project proposals is available for download below. Currently metadata is only provided for projects that solely use Census Bureau datasets. Project information will be updated quarterly.
The latest version is at https://www.census.gov/about/adrm/fsrdc/about/ongoing-projects.html.
