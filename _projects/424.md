abstract: "This research will estimate an empirical model that describes the decisions made by both households and ﬁrms within large, urban labor markets. The projects’ three main tasks are to estimate a model that describes household residential location choice and the employment status of household members, estimate a model describing the establishment location and employment decisions of ﬁrms, and conduct general equilibrium simulations using the estimated parameters from the two models. Analysis of the house-hold problem should provide new insights into the eﬀect of residential location on employment outcomes. The analysis of the ﬁrm problem is intended to examine the extent and nature of agglomeration economies within metropolitan areas, and the simulations that use the estimates from both models allow for an assessment of the general equilibrium eﬀect of changes in economic conditions on the patterns of individual and ﬁrm choices."
