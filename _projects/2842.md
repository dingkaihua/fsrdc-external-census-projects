abstract: "In this paper, I will use event study methods to study the dynamic relationships between labor market absences caused by family formation events and physicians' labor market outcomes, including their earnings, labor supply, accumulation of task-specific experience, and specialization. In order to study these relationships, I will create a longitudinal, quarterly dataset of individual physicians' careers spanning 2008-2020 by using the Numident File and Master Address Files from the US Census Bureau, together with the AMA Masterfile, to link collapsed physician-level data from the restricted-use version of the Medicare carrier file to physician-level information about household structure and demographics from the Census Household Composition Key File and the restricted-access American Community Survey. Using this dataset, I will estimate event studies with rich controls to characterize the average dynamic paths of physicians' labor market behavior around the time of their family formation decisions including child births and marriages. I will use the results of these event studies to study how much the accumulation of task-specific work experience affects gender gaps in labor market outcomes among physicians over the career cycle."
