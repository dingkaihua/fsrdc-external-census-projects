abstract: "In this research, we use the detailed geographic information available in the Longitudinal Business Database and the Business Register to trace the impact of local economic shocks and conditions on firm entry and growth. In particular, we exploit house price variation in the period of the Great Recession to examine the sensitivity of entry to a major economic shock, and estimate the subsequent impact on wage and productivity growth (as measured by revenue). We also examine how measures of density and agglomeration impact the firm lifecycle, and what this can tell us about how physical space impacts firm growth. This research is part of our broader agenda unifying the firm lifecycle with the spatial economics literature, which is an under-researched area of firm growth. This can help us understand whether and how space and the distribution of economic activity matters for macroeconomic aggregates, as well as the utility of local initiatives like place-based economic policy."
