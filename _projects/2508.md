abstract: "Several papers in the economics literature have documented large and persistent effects associated with graduating into a recession. However, comparatively less is known about how these effects vary over college quality. If these negative effects are disproportionately concentrated among individuals graduating from worse schools, then this heterogeneity may have important implications for income inequality and mobility. By using data on college attended and time of graduation in the restricted-use National Surveys of Graduates, we propose to study how the returns to higher-quality colleges vary over the business cycle. We expect that the earnings and employment premia associated with higher college quality increase during economic downturns, with potential drivers of this result including graduates of higher-quality colleges being more able to find jobs that match well with their skills or being more willing to move to better labor markets. These results may have important policy implications and will further our understanding of socioeconomic mobility and inequality in the United States."
