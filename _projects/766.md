abstract: "This project will develop links between the MEPS-IC and the MEPS-Household Component (MEPS-HC), as well as between the MEPS-IC and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics Individual Characteristics File (LEHD-ICF). These links will be constructed for the years 1996–2004 and will enhance the data by examining nonresponse to MEPS IC and evaluating possible methods to impute MEPS-IC variables that are not currently included in imputation procedures. Currently, the procedures for imputing missing or invalid values exist only for variables included in the MEPS-IC published estimates because developing these procedures requires resources. In the process of constructing the linked data sets, comparisons will also be made across these three nationally representative datasets: the MEPS IC, the MEPS HC, and the LEHD-ICF. This project will prepare estimates that model establishment offers of insurance, take-up rates, plan choice, total premiums, and employer premium contributions as a function of establishment and workforce characteristics. The researchers will examine multivariate models and bivariate associations to determine whether these newly imputed variables (e.g., percent over age 50) are predictive of these outcomes. They will evaluate the usefulness of the newly imputed variables in producing new estimates. They will also examine newly linked LEHD-ICF variables (e.g., race, citizenship and education) to see if they are predictive of outcomes of interest. This will provide evidence of the potential value of adding these new variables to the MEPS IC survey. This project will inform the U.S. Census Bureau about both employer behavior and also the linked behavior of employers and their employees with respect to the following topics: the effect of current tax subsidies on employer sponsored insurance, the revenue effects and incidence of reforms that cap tax subsidies, the effect of “tax price” on establishment and worker behavior, and the effect of reforms on establishment and worker behavior."
