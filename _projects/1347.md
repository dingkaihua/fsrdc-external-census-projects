abstract: "This project aims to identify the causal effects of big box grocers and warehouse clubs on household and child food insecurity. These types of stores may reduce food insecurity by lowering food prices and expanding food availability, especially for low-income households in areas with few grocery options. Food insecurity related outcomes (binary variables for household food insecurity, household very low food security, child food insecurity, and child very low food security) will come from the Current Population Study December Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS)."
