abstract: "This project will study the macroeconomic implications of worker quality and firm heterogeneity. Many macroeconomic phenomena--ranging from trends in productivity to relative declines in workers' earnings--are commonly examined through the lenses of models with either representative workers or representative firms. Understanding how deviations from these assumptions change our understanding of macroeconomic phenomena poses both a theoretical
challenge and, perhaps especially, an empirical challenge. Most commonly, researchers do not simultaneously observe detailed data both on firms and on the individual workers within those firms. By using combined employer and employee data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we will enhance understanding of how worker quality and firm heterogeneity interact in equilibrium to generate observed macroeconomic outcomes."
