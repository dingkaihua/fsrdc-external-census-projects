abstract: "This research focuses on the measurement of multinational activity, comparing it to domestic activity, and using measures to benchmark Census Bureau data. Using measures of domestic and multinational activity, two broad questions are addressed. First, what are the causes and consequences of multinational growth within the U.S. and abroad? The research design assesses the impact of multinationals across a range of economic variables including productivity, employment, and trade patterns. Second, what are the main drivers for technological change and reorganization at the firm level? How are these different for multinationals in terms of aggregation and behavior over the business cycle?"
