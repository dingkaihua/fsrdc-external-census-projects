abstract: "Multi-unit firms face a range of strategic decisions when it comes to locating their facilities. Such firms must consider not only the effects of collocation with competing firms, but also the competitive effects of their own alternate establishments. These decisions become more complicated as the multi-unit firm may also operate under multiple brands, which allows the firm to differentiate an establishment not only from its external competitors, but also from its own, internal, competing locations. The interaction of geography, brand, and ownership incentives gives rise to multiple questions concerning establishment performance, strategic differentiation, strategic behavior across geographic markets, overall system (across establishment) performance, and the evolution of local geographic markets. 
This project draws on the intersection of economic and management literatures on agglomeration effects, brand diversification, and multi-unit ownership incentives. We use establishment-level Census data from the U.S. lodging industry to exam how geographic collocation (or clustering), ownership structures, and the nature of diversification within the cluster affect performance at the establishment level. We further distinguish between multi-unit franchisees versus franchisor-owned establishments. We examine whether multi-unit owners choose to diversify their portfolio of businesses either geographically or in brand/quality space. We examine whether and how multi-unit ownership affects the decision to enter or likelihood of exiting a particular geographic market. We also examine whether multi-market contact between firms affects pricing behavior and performance across geographic markets, and whether it matters whether such contact is at the brand or ownership levels.
