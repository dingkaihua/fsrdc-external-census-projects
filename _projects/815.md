abstract: "This project will analyze the process of new venture formation in the US economy with particular emphasis on employee entrepreneurship. The project will create a new-ventures dataset, and will use that dataset to examine new venture formation in three closely related investigations. The first will compare the performance of new ventures with different pre-entry histories, and analyze how these performance variations are related to the characteristics of the new venture's founders and its parent firm. The second will shift the focus to spinoffs, i.e., new firms started by clusters of employees from an existing firm and will examine why some firms and industries seem to spawn more spinoffs than others. The last investigation will narrow the focus to a single institutional factor -- non-compete covenants -- and will seek to understand if inter-state differences in the enforceability of these covenants affect new firm creation.
