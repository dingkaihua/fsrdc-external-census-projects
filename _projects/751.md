abstract: "This project studies how spatial location and firm organization influence productivity and technological spillovers.  The project proposes and tests that regional clustering increases within-firm spillovers and decreases the extent to which firms are vertically integrated.  The project also explicitly tests for evidence of worker flow spillovers across industries in a pair of economically related high-tech localized industries that experienced regulatory shocks influencing entry.  The project benefits the Census Bureau by verifying the accuracy of the Business Register, merging in new establishment-level technology and customer data, and by informing the Census about supply chains and organizations.
