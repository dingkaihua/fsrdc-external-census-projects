abstract: "What is the relationship between consumer and firm credit, earnings, and entrepreneurship? In particular, this project aims to uncover the impact of consumer and firm credit on occupational choices (i.e. 'formal' unemployment-insured jobs vs. 'informal' self-employed jobs vs. starting an employer business), the rate at which individuals (either entrepreneurs or wage earners) transition between income and earnings deciles, and the subsequent feedback of income changes to financial distress. In this project we lay out 4 testable hypotheses, as well as multiple identification strategies for each hypothesis.
The general theme of these hypotheses is that households have gained significant amounts of access to credit (defined as the available borrowing limit across all types of credit) over the past 40 years and we want to uncover how this run-up in credit has impacted the real economy. In addition, small firms have gained access to credit through banking reform as has been recently studied by Bai et al. (2016a). The first two hypotheses are aimed at understanding how access to credit has affected individuals' ability to start businesses, the types of employees they hire, innovation, and subsequent earnings inequality. Our identification strategies rely on a mix of IV-estimators and other natural experiments. We also plan to provide several important descriptive statistics, including income and earnings transition matrices for individuals and entrepreneurs as a function of their access to credit as well as other characteristics. 
The third portion of the project is to understand the feedback from income changes to credit access and financial distress to firm outcomes such as purchase of entrepreneurial firms and going public through initial public offerings. We plan to study the relationship between income volatility, firm earnings volatility and access to credit. In particular, how does the level and variability of income affect an individual's ability to obtain a mortgage? What is the impact of income variability and credit access of firms on financial distress for self-employed and working individuals? Simple OLS analyses will go a long way toward understanding these relationships, but we also provide some more sophisticated identification strategies to uncover these relationships. 
The fourth part of the project is to understand worker choice of type of firm to work for.  A major policy issue has been a big drop in entrepreneurship in the US over a long period. Researchers have focused on the actual entrepreneurs - their financing, demographics affecting the supply of potential entrepreneurs, exit options.  Our focus is on the workers choosing between entrepreneurial firms and other firms."
