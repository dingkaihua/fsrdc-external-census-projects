abstract: "We propose a three-year study of the residential choices of interracial partners to expand our understanding, empirically and theoretically, of multiraciality and interracial partnerships in American metropolitan areas. The basic questions we intend to address are as follows: Do interracial families live in segregated neighborhoods? Do they live in neighborhoods dominated by a particular race/ethnic group? Does this depend on the race of the male partner or the female partner? Do the social class positions of the partners affect the coupleâ€™s residential choices? These initial steps in the investigation of the residential geography of interracial households set the stage for us to address a set of derivative questions associated with the permanence of ethnic and racial boundaries. In particular, what are the implications of the geography of residential choice for the childbearing decisions and the racial/ethnic identity of children of interracial couples? To answer these questions we will make use of two data sets. The first contains detailed individual level information from a special version of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. These data provide a one in six sample of individuals that permits us to study the residential location of interracial couples at the scale of the census tract. Simply stated, these data allow us analyze the residential location of interracial couples with previously unavailable geographical detail. The second data set is mortgage application information from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. These data record the race of single and joint applicants for home mortgages and the tract location of the property for which the loan is sought. We intend to merge these data for a number of years in the 1990s to analyze the residential preferences of interracial couples. The analysis will benefit the bureau in four ways: improvements in ethnic and racial imputation procedures; checking the validity of decennial data on interracial couples against an alternative federal data source; identifying tracts which should have high rates of multiracial reporting on Census 2000; and improving ethnic and racial population projections through better understanding of ethnic and racial identity formation of children of interracial couples."
