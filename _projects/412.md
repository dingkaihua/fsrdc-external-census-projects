abstract: "The project seeks to evaluate race-ethnic selective migration processes in the US and their impacts on large metropolitan areas. It will employ the “residence 5 years ago” question for successive censuses to determine if immigration and internal migration processes are leading to greater dispersion of the nation’s detailed race-and ethnic groups across metropolitan areas. It will also evaluate the consistency and accuracy of “residence 5 years ago” responses over time for race-ethnic groups. The project will use the Michigan RDC to analyze census long form data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. If it becomes available during the course of this project, the analysis will also incorporate data from the 1980 Census. The concentration of Hispanic and Asian populations in New York, Los Angeles, and a few other large metropolitan areas is related to their recent immigrant status and attachments to co-ethnic communities in those areas. (Liaw and Frey, 1998; Gober, 2000,Waldinger, 2001). Yet, recent Census 2000 results suggest their greater geographic dispersal (Frey, 2002c, Suro and Singer, 2002). The African-American population, while less concentrated than these groups, has shown an increased tendency to relocate in the South countering a long-standing movement in the reverse direction (Frey 2001b). Using a variety of demographic techniques, and migration models , we will assess the extent to which migration processes are leading to even further dispersal of race-ethnic groups by examining inter-metropolitan migration across the nation’s large metropolitan areas over the periods, 1985-90, 1995-2000 (and if data become available during this project), 1975-80. The proposed migration research will benefit the Census Bureau’s Population Division by: providing information relevant to the quality, possible new tabulations, imputations and additional collection needs of race-ethnic data based on the decennial census “residence 5 years ago” question as it applies to different facets of the Division’s work on migration and race/ethnic identification, and subnational population estimates and projections. To this end, the migration analyses will focus on identifying heterogeneity of migration patterns for specific race and ethnic groups (or combinations thereof) within the broad race and ethnic groups that are usually included in the full sample release of migration information in standard Census summary files, publications, and in their estimation and projection models. The above analyses will shed light on data quality and measurement issues. For example, the comparison of one race alone (e.g.. whites) migration patterns with those for that race in combination with others (e.g., whites in combinations with others) in 2000, and for that race in 1990 will shed light on the utility of using the former as a proxy for a given race, when comparing patterns over time. Our migration models which include parameters for nativity, and year of entry can also inform the Census Bureau’s post-censal estimate and projection procedures which incorporate race—ethnic specific migration assumptions."
