abstract: "This project will examine how a worker's first type of occupation impacts their later-stage career outcomes, and how these impacts differ by worker characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, gender, and Veteran status. More specifically, we will link the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data to the American Community Survey (ACS) and aggregate external data on the characteristics of occupations reported in the ACS. We will use novel machine learning techniques to predict up to ten of the most likely occupations for a worker's primary LEHD job (defined as the highest-earning job), and then examine how the type of occupation a worker holds early in her career influences later-stage career outcomes, including earnings, employment, and occupational prestige. This analysis will enable us to characterize initial jobs and occupations that offer workers the greatest opportunities for advancement and mobility."
