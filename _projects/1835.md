abstract: "This study evaluates how local geographic, socioeconomic, and industrial factors impact the size of an industry in a county. We utilize data from the Business Register, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Annual Retail Trade Survey, and the Annual Survey of Manufactures, as well as other economic and demographic datasets to assess the size of an industry in a county. We model the unbiased minimum and total establishment counts due to the inclusion of nonemployers, and the increased accuracy in the measurement of industry size by using employment and payroll, rather than only the number of establishments, in a broader range of industries than previous research has addressed. We also examine how local geographic, socioeconomic, and industrial factors predict operating costs, and how local geographic, socioeconomic, and industrial factors predict e-commerce usage, which will significantly contribute to economic and regional science academic literature."
