abstract: "This project proposes to estimate the effect of drinking water and water pollution violations on population flows and economic development. The advancing age of much of the U.S. water infrastructure as well as the population loss and shrinking tax base of many cities and rural communities make this a pressing issue requiring investigation. To study this question, we will link public water violation data from the Environmental Protection Agency with restricted-use Census data from the Longitudinal Business Database, County Business Patterns Business Register, and the American Community Survey from 2005-2019. Our estimates regarding changing location decisions of residents and businesses will also aid in properly modeling changing population dynamics of rural and micropolitan areas. To analyze firm location decisions and population shifts, we will use a count model such as a double-hurdle model as well as spatial equilibrium model where firms maximize profits and individuals maximize utility. We will analyze all counties and/or Census tracts in the US, but we will also perform sub-analysis by NAICS industry codes as well as urban rural divides as permitted by necessary disclosure avoidance."
