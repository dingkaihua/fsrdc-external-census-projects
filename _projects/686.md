abstract: "This project will create a new, matched employee-employer dataset for use by researchers in the process of studying the determinants of employment-based insurance supply by firms. Theory suggests that, if a firm is not fully aware of the cost efficiency of an insurance company health care network, it will have to pay a premium to distinguish between the more and less efficient networks. Either asymmetric information or adverse selection exists since the insurance company knows its own quality or cost efficiency while its client(s) may not. If the insurance company charges too high a "quality" premium on some of its plans, thereby revealing its affordability and efficiency types, firms need to decide which plans continue to meet a minimum efficiency level and remain affordable based on the revealed insurance company type. This project will measure the efficiency of different plan options and estimate the cut-off efficiency value that firms from different sectors can afford to finance. In the process, this study will promote an understanding of why some sectors with high demand for health care and a given premium structure do not offer health insurance plans, whereas other sectors offer multiple options to their employees despite low demand."
