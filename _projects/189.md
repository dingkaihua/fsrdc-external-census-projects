abstract: "This proposal has four interrelated parts, which use Census Bureau establishment level data for the manufacturing, headquarters, and business, professional, and financial service sectors. The first part that applies throughout examines the utility of these Census data by evaluating both their quality and their ability to characterize potentially important developments in these sectors. The other three parts deal with the specifics of the economic investigations using these data. What are these investigations? Certain service and headquarters activities locate disproportionately in the largest metro areas, while manufacturing is found disproportionately in smaller towns and cities. Broadly defined business services have twice the share of employment in the largest metro areas as they do in the smallest cities, while for manufacturing it is the other way around. The question is why; and, hence, what is the role of large metro areas versus small and medium size cities in a country. To start to understand the forces at work, we need to examine at a micro level the local growth patterns, productivity, and outsourcing decisions in these industries. Urban agglomeration is determined primarily by two related forces. First are local scale externalities from information spillovers and labor market operations, whether internal to an industry or deriving from the overall scale of the local urban environment. Second are the benefits to local firms from local linkages in input and output markets. To what extent are headquarters in metro areas to take advantage of the diversity of local intermediate service inputs, as opposed to gather information about innovations, export markets, financing, and the like through local information spillovers from, say, other headquarters? Similarly, why are services located in the largest and most expensive metro areas? To what extent is it local scale externalities within the service sector, versus upstream and downstream linkages within the service sector, versus linkages to sectors using services (e.g., headquarters) where those sectors may experience high own-sector scale externalities? The first two sections of the proposal examine these issues through a detailed analysis of city growth of headquarters and service industries, out-sourcing decisions, and productivity of headquarters and service sector firms. A variety of questions are explored econometrically. The third section of the proposal looks at the determinants of industry mobility across cities. The fourth section of the proposal illustrates issues concerning the utility of the data that this work will examine in the course of data preparation and analysis. The proposal involves the use of the Longitudinal Research Data [LRD] for manufacturing, the Company Auxiliary Organization [CAO] and the Large Company Survey [ES-9100] for headquarters and firms, the Standard Statistical Establishment List [SSEL] and the time linked version of that [LBD] for service sector establishments, and the Assets and Expenditures Survey [AES] for service establishment material, service, and capital inputs (including computers). The CAO and ES-9100 have been rarely used in the past; the LBD has just been constructed to link establishments over time; and the AES has never been used by academic researchers. The project will benefit Census Bureau programs in understanding the quality of data produced through Census surveys, as well as identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs. The part of the project which employs location information (in the LRD, CAO, and AES) to examine plant location and mobility across geographic areas will help identify strengths and weaknesses of current geo-coding operations. It will reveal trends in industrial location that the Census Bureau should be aware of in its future collection activities. The service-outsourcing component of the project is the first systematic look at the importance of collecting (or not collecting) this kind of cost data. Expenditure questions for business services such as legal and accounting were only first asked in the 1992 ASM. The project will help understand if these costs are a significant proportion of total production costs for plants, headquarters and firms in the AES, CAO, ES-9100, and Annual Survey of Manufactures [ASM] and how such costs vary across service and manufacturing sectors of the economy. The analysis will reveal which categories of purchased services are most important items for data collection in different surveys. It will also reveal whether questions about out-sourcing in categories such as repair services are properly constructed or whether more questions about intrafirm relations and exchange of services would be helpful in either the CAO, ES-9100, or plant surveys. The project will investigate headquarters and service industry survey responses that in general have been little explored by researchers and analysts beyond the basic Title 13 reporting activity conducted by Census. This work parallels the extensive expansion of the service sector surveys currently underway within the Census Economic Survey programs. Given how dynamic these sectors of the economy are, the analysis of this project will help provide important input to the evaluation and anticipation of the changes occurring in these sectors and their impact on survey execution. Opportunities can be uncovered for question clarification to improve the accuracy of the information reported by survey respondents. For example, does the AES include all the key pieces of information on the economic behavior of large service firms, are certain questions ill-designed to induce the desired correct response, or are some questions irrelevant? How useful for economic analyses are the individual industry Census of Services questionnaires and well do they integrate into the AES for analysis? The scope of the project includes many data sets. By linking the data sets together by firm, it is possible to identify the extent to which the establishments and firms match up over the surveys. Because each are the result of different survey processes, the linking will help clarify coverage of multiestablishment firmsâ€™ activity and information gathered. Is there organizational complexity that is not currently being correctly captured by the surveys? Can we infer new information by combining the surveys? For example, is there additional detail on the functions of auxiliary establishments that can be uncovered using the industry classifications of other operating units in the same firm? Do outsourcing expenditures for, say, legal services for establishments across the surveys add up to the totals reported for the firm? If not, can the differences be identified and understood? Are differences expected or problematic, and if so what can be done to improve coverage?"
