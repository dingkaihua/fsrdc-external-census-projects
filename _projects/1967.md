abstract: "This research will provide the first estimates of the dynamic effects of wage minimums and maximums on wage inequality and employment in the United States. We combine demographic data from the Decennial Censuses of 1950–2000 with data on wage setting minimums and maximums by occupation and geographical area during World War II. We then estimate the impact of wage controls on wage inequality using spatial discontinuity in wage setting across War Labor Board regions and zones. In particular, we compare economically similar proximate towns located in different War Labor Board regions and zones and, thus, subject to different wage regulation during World War II. Using this approach, we will estimate the effect of minimum and maximum wages on wage inequality and employment using the 1950–2000 Decennial Censuses to estimate the dynamic impacts of the regulation after it was rescinded. In doing so, this project sheds light on the causes of the decline in inequality experienced in the post-war period and contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the importance of institutions for inequality.
