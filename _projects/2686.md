abstract: "Using the technology module from the Annual Business Survey, bank call report data from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, and loan-level origination data from government-sponsored enterprises and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, we study the determinants of banks' use of fintech and expect to find that greater availability of fintech and market pressure from shadow banks is associated with higher use of fintech. We also study the consequences of banks' use of fintech and expect to find that greater use is associated with greater risk-taking, risk assessment (ambiguous prediction), better risk management, and better quantity and quality of credit supply."
