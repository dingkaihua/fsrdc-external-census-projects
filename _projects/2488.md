abstract: "In this project we examine the long-run economic consequences of the transition to parenthood from a couple's perspective, with a particular interest in how they have changed over time for different socioeconomic groups and how they contribute to income inequality across households. We use successive panels from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked to the Detailed Earnings Record (DER), the Numident, and Census Household Composition Key datasets to study how the transition to parenthood shapes within and between household economic inequalities. We use couple-level fixed effects regression models to study how coupled men's and women's earnings change with the transition to parenthood (and how these changes have evolved since the 1980s across different socioeconomic groups) and we use log-linear models and simulation/decomposition methods to study how the economic consequences of parenthood shape family income inequality. These questions represent critical gaps in the literature on gender, work, and family that limit our understanding of how family decision-making is shaped by changing norms and institutions and in turn how these processes play into increasing income inequality across households. We expect that the economic consequences of parenthood have declined most rapidly for highly skilled women, who have most incentives to stay attached to the labor force after parenthood, and that those changes might have contributed to exacerbate income inequality across households."
