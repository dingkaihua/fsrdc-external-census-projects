abstract: "Retirement allows older adults to make location choices free from labor market implications. Prior research explores how financial resources affect migration choices and suggests that one motivation in particular applies to wealthier Americans - estate taxes. Due to the elimination of a tax credit in 2005 that allowed a dollar for dollar reduction in an individual's federal tax liability in the amount of that individual's state-level estate tax, enormous effective variation now exists in estate tax rates across the states that levy estate taxes. This research will use microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau to compare long- versus short-term state-to-state migration flows for older Americans, including return or circular migration. In particular, the research will provide an increased understanding of how state-levied estate taxes affect these migration patterns."
