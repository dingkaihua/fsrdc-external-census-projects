abstract: "This project has three related parts, each of which is designed to understand the implications of the growing geographic separation of R&D and production for US firms. There are two competing views on this. One view is that offshoring increases US innovation by allowing domestic firms to specialize in what they do best. By shedding activities that can be performed at lower cost offshore US firms become more competitive and have a stronger incentive to engage in R&D (specialization view). A more recent view is that the separation of R&D and production involved in offshoring limits learning-by-doing production insights from reaching the firmsâ€™ headquarters and so slows down U.S. innovation: as the country loses manufacturing it also loses its innovation capabilities (hence, called capabilities view). By tackling this question directly our project will inform the Census Bureau on whether its current approach for tracking U.S. innovation should be changed to ensure that it fully captures the various ways in which US firms innovate.
The project will assess the empirical support for the view that firms benefit from the geographic specialization of production and non-production, versus the view that co-location is instead preferable. The central question is: to what extent do firms benefit from co-locating technology creation (such as R&D labs) and production activities in close geographic proximity, either domestically and/or abroad? While interest in understanding the forces underlying the agglomeration (and co-agglomeration) of industries goes back at least to Marshall (1890), with Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr (2010) a major recent contribution to the co-agglomeration literature, the importance of geographic proximity between production and R&D labs for innovation is to date largely unknown."
