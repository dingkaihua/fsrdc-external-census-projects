abstract: "This proposal is part of a larger study of the impact of welfare reform on California’s immigrant families. We propose to use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Current Population Survey (CPS) linked to two major statewide administrative data sets in California, the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS) of the California Department of Health Services and Unemployment Insurance/Disability Insurance (hereafter referred to as EDD data) of the California Employment Development Department. The linkage of these data sets will produce longitudinal files for the California sub-sample of the CPS and SIPP with detailed information on immigration status and household characteristics combined with administrative data on public assistance program participation and earnings over time. The proposed research will benefit the Census Bureau in a number of distinct ways. First, it will provide the Census Bureau with a basis to evaluate the accuracy of important self-reported measures in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), including Medicaid coverage, receipt of cash aid, Food Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This validation will be valuable for the future use of these surveys because SIPP and CPS tend to differ significantly in their estimates of participation in these important programs. Second, comparing the SIPP and CPS data on program participation with the MEDS records will allow us to investigate differences between self-reports and administrative records for the two same individuals due to characteristics of the surveys, such as reference time periods and question wording, which are linked to the inaccuracies of survey respondents’ self reports. Third, the match of EDD records with CPS and SIPP records will provide us with estimates of the direction and size of errors in reported earnings in the surveys. Fourth, this match will enable us to examine more closely the differences in poverty measures and rates using the CPS and SIPP by comparing the two surveys to administrative wage records and public assistance use. Fifth, using the administrative data we will evaluate the Survey of Population Dynamics (SPD) for its ability to track the use of welfare programs. Finally, the proposed match offers important insights on the residence and movements of immigrants and will contribute to improving the Demographic Analysis population projections."
