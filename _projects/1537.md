abstract: "Adaptation is a necessary approach to dealing with the harsh effects of climate change. This project uses panel data from the American Housing Survey to examine consumers' upgrade choices for four key types of temperature-modifying household equipment: air conditioning, heating system, insulation, and windows/doors. Daily temperature data are matched to the AHS at the SMSA level to examine whether upgrade choices for ACs and heaters are sensitive to extreme weather. Climate simulations will also be performed, using forecasts of temperatures from various climate scenarios until 2061."
