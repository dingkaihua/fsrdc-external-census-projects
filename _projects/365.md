abstract: "This project will study the linkages among price competition, non-price competition and industry structure in the food services industry. Using information on revenues, prices and non-price product attributes, it will provide direct empirical evidence of how firms’ prices and product choice are related to each other and to industry structure. This will shed light on how firms compete in industries with many firms and heterogeneous products, typical characteristics of the growing services sector. It will add to the knowledge of how markets work by revealing some of the feedback mechanisms between structure and conduct in such markets. The primary dataset will be firm-level microdata for food services establishments from the Economic Census in 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997. I will use the information on revenues, prices and product attributes from this dataset to analyze how firms compete in prices and non-price characteristics and to relate market structure to the competitiveness of industry. The analysis will consist mostly of statistical tests and estimation techniques to study the relationships between these variables. Therefore, the output will largely be regression estimates and aggregate statistics. I will work closely with Census staff to avoid inappropriate disclosure. Other datasets to be used in this study are the Business Expenditures Survey (BES), Assets and Expenditures Survey (AES), County Business Patterns (CPB), Country and City Data Books (CCDB), the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) in 1971-1997, where each is available. I will use firm-level operating expenses data from the BES, AES and CPB to control for variation in costs across firms and market-level data to control for variation in costs across markets. The CCDB will provide demographic information to account for variation in tastes across markets. The SSEL contains firm identifiers, name and address files that I will use to track affiliation among establishments. The LBD contains firm identifiers that will help to link the data across years for longitudinal analysis.
This project’s main benefit to the Census will be to provide an evaluation of the quality of the microdata for the food services industry. This will enhance the Census’ understanding of the dataset and provide guidance for improvements to its surveys. Specifically, this project will assess the quality of the data with regard to non-responses, characterize the extent of imputed data, and document higher moments and other statistical characteristics of the distribution of key variables. Furthermore, it will verify the internal consistency of the data and provide the Census with a cleaned and documented dataset that may be useful to other researchers. The proposed project will also enhance the Census microdata by developing links to market-level costs data in the BES and CPB, and to market-level population and household demographics in the CCDB. In addition, for a subset of establishments, it will link the Census microdata to firm-level operating expenses information in the BES. The resulting dataset will contain rich information on costs, prices, product choice and revenues for individual firms. Finally, the project may also provide links over time for these data for longitudinal analysis. Another benefit that will come from this project is the preparation of estimates of several characteristics of the food services establishment population. Estimates of the correlation among prices, product attributes, ownership structure, demand characteristics and costs will enhance the Census’ understanding of how these variables are related in this industry. These estimates will be provided at the market and establishment levels."
