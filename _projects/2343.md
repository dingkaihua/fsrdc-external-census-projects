abstract: "The future size and composition of the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population is difficult to predict using the demographic balancing equation. Race response change (or "mental migration") and racial misclassification on death certificates creates the need for additional adjustments. First, I will use cohort component analysis, including adjustments for race response change and mortality misclassification, to develop national AIAN population projections. Linked data to calculate rates of race response change will include decennial censuses, the American Community Survey, and the Current Population Survey (2000 to the present). This project applies my prior work on mental migration to a practical issue that affects policy makers and planners. Because mental migration is so common among AIAN people, the possible future population is much larger than usually estimated. Second, I will use the Navajo Nation Adult Voter data (NNAV; user-provided data) linked with the other data to develop population projections of Navajo people specifically. Tribal nation-specific projections can be more useful than nationwide projections. I expect Navajo rates of race response change to be lower than the overall AIAN rates and projections to show accordingly smaller variation. Third, expanding on my prior work on tribal non-response with unlinked data, I will investigate non-response to the tribe question among Navajo people. A tribe-specific focus is only possible with linked data, and allows more detailed (and thus useful) analysis of the reasons people do not always respond to this seemingly-important question. "
