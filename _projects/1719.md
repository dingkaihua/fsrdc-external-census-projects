abstract: "This research examines the effects of civil service reforms on municipal bureaucracies and their performance. Historically, public administration in the United States was characterized by a spoils system in which elected politicians had the power to hire and fire bureaucrats. Provisions aimed at professionalizing the bureaucracy were first introduced at the federal level and slowly diffused to lower levels of government. These reforms were characterized by both meritocratic hiring and political protections for public employees. These reforms may select in better workers through competitive entrance requirements but reduce performance incentives through tenure. This projects examines those states that mandated cities to institute civil service boards for police and fire departments based on population thresholds. This research exploits these thresholds in a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of introducing the merit system. First, using data from the decennial censuses of 1960 to 2000, this projects looks at the effect on the demographic composition of police and fire departments and, in particular, the gender, age, and racial composition of these department, together with the educational level of policemen and firemen. Second, this research studies whether the reforms had effects on the performance of these departments, including crime rates. "
