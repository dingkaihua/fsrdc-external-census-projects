abstract: "This project is concerned specifically with evaluating internal microdata for island areas that are U.S. possessions (Northern Marianas, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa) to determine whether the published tabulations accurately reflect the underlying relationships in the microdata.  Any discrepancies will be reported to the program area as well as the Bureau of Economic Analysis for input into BEA's GDP estimates for the affected sectors and geographical units."
