abstract: "We propose to use the linked administrative data available in the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) to study the impacts of several aspects of the early childhood environment--including access to social safety net programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Food Stamps, exposure to air pollution, and exposure to adverse climate shocks--on criminal-justice-related outcomes measured in adulthood, including arrests and incarceration. Our proposed research designs will build on the existing quasi-experimental literatures that have analyzed the causal impacts of these early childhood factors on other outcomes (e.g., infant health and adult earnings). Specifically, we will use variation from: (i) the county-by-county rollouts of the WIC and Food Stamps programs, (ii) county-level nonattainment designations stemming from the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, and (iii) fine-level temporal variation in temperature and weather shocks such as hurricanes across counties. We expect that exposure to adverse shocks in early childhood may increase the likelihood of adult involvement in the criminal justice system, while early childhood access to social safety net programs may reduce this likelihood. We will also investigate the impacts of our treatment variables on mobility and mortality to assess the role of selection bias in our main estimates of effects on criminal justice system outcomes."
