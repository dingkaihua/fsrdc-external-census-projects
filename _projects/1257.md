abstract: "This project will quantify the relationship between offshoring activities and the rate of innovation of U.S. firms. To analyze this, the researchers will compare the innovation rates of firms that offshore with those that do not, using Chinaâ€™s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 as an external shock that generates a quasi-random sample of firms. The key challenge is to ensure that firms who do offshore are not too different from firms that do not offshore in terms of their determinants of innovation, which will require an appropriate comparison group that only Census Bureau microdata can provide. Building upon two previous studies that point to evidence of R&D spillovers to domestic firms from foreign-owned production and the potential knowledge costs from separating production facilities and firm headquarters, this empirical study will attempt to disentangle these opposing effects and quantify the influence of offshoring on different measures of innovation, including R&D expenditures, patenting, and trademarks. This project will provide a better understanding of how plant characteristics relate to offshoring and of the international scope of R&D for many firms and improve accuracy by comparing locational outcomes and activities of innovation."
