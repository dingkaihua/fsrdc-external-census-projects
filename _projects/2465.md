abstract: "Recent declines in female labor force participation and fertility have reignited interest in the roles of child care access and costs in shaping the labor supply decisions of women with young children. This project aims to provide new empirical evidence of the effect of universal pre-K introduction on mothers' labor supply. I use the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) to study the 2014 introduction of "Pre-K For All" in New York City, a universal pre-K (UPK) policy that increased the city's capacity of full-day, public preschool seats for 4 year olds from around 20,000 in 2013 to approximately 70,000 in 2015. To identify the causal effect of the UPK offer on mothers' labor force participation and hours worked, I use a difference-in-differences (DID) research design that leverages age and residency eligibility requirements to construct two different comparison groups of mothers: Mothers of same-aged children in nearby New Jersey, and mothers of slightly older children that reside in NYC. I also combine these two contrasts to estimate a triple-differences (DDD) model. I hypothesize that the "Pre-K For All" offer induces mothers to increase their labor market activity both on the extensive and intensive margins."
