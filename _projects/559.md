abstract: "Spin-outs are distinct entrepreneurial ventures where founding team members are ex-employees of an incumbent ﬁrm. In many industries, spin-outs (progeny ﬁrms) compete directly with the incumbents (parent ﬁrms) and are an important source of innovation and growth. Previous research has emphasized the beneﬁcial performance implications of the knowledge diﬀusion from the parent to the progeny and have found that the inherited knowledge provides spin-out ﬁrms both superior capabilities and performance vis-à-vis other entrants. However, little is known about the competitive eﬀects of these knowledge ﬂows on the subsequent capabilities and performance of parent ﬁrms. This project will investigate the processes that generate ﬁrm births and deaths in general but also those that generate spin-oﬀ  births in particular. The research will identify new ﬁrms, spin-oﬀ  ﬁrms, and the parents of these new spin-oﬀ ﬁrms in the legal services industry. It will analyze the characteristics of these new ﬁrms as well as the parents of spin-oﬀ  ﬁrms. This process is especially interesting in the services sector where barriers to entry are generally low and ﬁrm birth and death rates are very high. As a result of this high turnover, it has traditionally been diﬃcult to accurately mea-sure new ﬁrm generation, the characteristics of new ﬁrms, and the performance of new ﬁrms in the services sector. However, with a custom Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) extract in conjunction with the external Martindale-Hubbell directory, this project will be able to accurately portray characteristics of new and dying ﬁrms as well as to estimate birth and death rates in this sector. Moreover, this project will develop and test new methodologies of spin-oﬀ generation and knowledge as well as examine the quality of the LEHD data in comparison to the Martindale-Hubbell data."
