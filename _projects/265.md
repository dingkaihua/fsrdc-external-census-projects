abstract: "During business cycles, firms adjust various margins. Research using plant-level data unmasks the plant-level investment path. However, many decisions are made at the firm level. This project explores one of the margins that a firm can adjust during the business cycle; to wit, product diversification. I set up a suggestive model, showing diversification, investment and debt policy. My project will analyze why, when and how the firm diversifies, which is not done in the existing literature. Diversification decisions would be one of the possible reasons why the firm's investment is lumpy and traditional investment and inventory models cannot explain investment. My project is consistent with other research that is beginning to analyze various adjustment margins of the firm. Along with the simulation results from my model, I will find new stylized facts of the annual pattern of firm's diversification at firm and plant level. I have three approaches to do so, dealing with certainty company cases, single units, and multi units. The first two approaches require the ASM and CM. The last one needs LBD data as well. My project will compare three datasets and evaluate their analytical abilities. Three datasets can be combined to overcome the defects of each of the datasets."
