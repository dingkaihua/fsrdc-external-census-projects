abstract: "The purpose of this research is to increase the knowledge base of the Census Bureau with respect to the impact of informational barriers on firms involved in international trade.  The objectives are to compile a measure of origin of movement state export scope, create a measure of state export scope based on the location of the exporting agent relative to the state production scope, and conduct regression analysis relating export promotion, the information required to make an informed purchase, and both state export scopes relative to production scope.  This will improve the understanding of the export patterns of the United States."
