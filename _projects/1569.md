abstract: "This project examines the firm-level mechanisms that can account for changes in the dynamics of capital goods orders and shipments in periods around recessions. Using the Manufacturersâ€™ Shipments, Inventories, and Orders Survey (M3) microdata, the project initially attempts to confirm at the firm level that shipments become more responsive to orders when orders weaken considerably. The project then merges the M3 data with other Census Bureau microdata, including the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures, along with other publicly-available data, such as Compustat, to identify some of the factors that may help explain cyclical changes in the response of capital goods producers to demand shocks. The project will also calibrate and estimate a structural model of how the delivery lag for capital goods is determined, and attempt to explain its behavior over the business cycle."
