abstract: "This project will examine workers and businesses when workers face differential outside employment opportunities. The researchers will investigate how decisions by workers impact future firm performance and other firm and establishment outcomes, as well as the effects of those opportunities on employee labor market outcomes such as the choice of employer and current/future earnings and tenure. The researchers will explore whether workers employed by firms facing competitive employment pressures are more likely to leave for other employment and whether such firms raise wages in an effort to retain workers. The researchers will investigate the impact on firm outcomes created when firms employ certain kinds of workers and the implications of these wage decisions for future firm performance. Finally, this research will examine key firm characteristics that may either mitigate or exacerbate the relationships described above."
