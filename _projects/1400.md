abstract: "This project aims at (i) measuring the reaction of production networks to various firm-specific or sector-specific shocks, and (ii) understanding how firms adjust their network position in anticipation of these shocks. This research relates to a growing body of work assessing whether significant aggregate fluctuations may originate from microeconomic shocks. While earlier work has focused on the linkages across sectors, with mixed results, the objective here is to estimate linkages within networks of firms. The Commodity Flow Survey, which is the main source of supply chain information produced by the Census Bureau, will be merged and compared with two publicly available sources of information on supply chain relationships: Compustat and the Federal Procurement Data System. A variety of sources of shocks will be considered, including natural disasters, power outages, trade shocks, government spending shocks, and credit-supply shocks. This project also builds on earlier work that considers the importance of switching costs for the propagation of firm-level shocks. The study of the degree of interdependencies between firms in production network is a key parameter to assess the vulnerability of the real economy to microeconomic shocks."
