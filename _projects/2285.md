abstract: "Recent economic and weather shocks have highlighted a critical need to understand change in Puerto Rico's population. Our research will investigate the hypothesis that two major events - the economic crisis and the 2017 hurricanes - changed Puerto Rico residents' fertility and migration calculus, while affecting mortality in the short-term as well as over a multiple year period. In particular, we expect that the economic crisis and uncertainty after the 2017 hurricane season suppressed fertility, increased mortality in the short term and possible lowered mortality over a longer period, and increased out-migration.
We have three research aims. First, we will describe period and cohort trends in fertility, mortality and migration between 2000 and the latest year for which data are available. These components of demographic change are important for understanding how the sociodemographic characteristics of the population change, both through direct effects (birth, death, out-migration, in-migration) and indirect effects (changes in the population at risk of birth, death, and migration). Second, we will describe the residential locations of Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico or other U.S. states and territories in each year between 2000 and the latest year for which data are available. Third, we will compare demographic, social, geographic, and economic statuses for out-migrants and comparable non-migrants in Puerto Rico to investigate how residential mobility to the US mainland is associated with mortality, fertility, health, household income, poverty, and residential outcomes."
