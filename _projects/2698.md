abstract: "How does firm-level misallocation modulate the size of the gains from trade? In this project, I propose a way to detect significant deviation from optimal allocation of production factors across firms and develop an open-economy model that incorporates firm-level misallocation. Using the model, I measure the size of the welfare gains from trade liberalization both with and without misallocation to estimate the impact of domestic distortions on the gains from trade. In a broad class of models featuring monopolistic competition, heterogeneous firms, and fixed overhead cost associated with exports, I show that under the optimal allocation, firm size and revenue productivity are positively correlated among non-exporting firms, and firm size and export intensity are positively correlated among exporting firms. I test these correlations in both Chinese manufacturing sector survey data and the US Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) data. Then I extend the canonical model to explicitly allow misallocation. The model parameters are estimated using the same datasets again for China and the US. Preliminary findings show that in the Chinese manufacturing sector, the patterns expected under the optimal allocation fail to hold and that the size of the gains from trade is dampened due to the observed distortions. With the US data, I expect that expected patterns to generally hold and the effect of misallocation on the gains from trade to be smaller in magnitude."
