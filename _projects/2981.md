abstract: "This paper investigates the effects of firm ownership and information disclosure regulation on the composition and costs of external financing for private and public (listed) US firms. Theoretical literature has shown that private information affects firm's capital structure, borrowing costs, and could result in capital misallocation (e.g. DeMarzo and Fishman (RFS, 2007), Holmstrom and Tirole (QJE, 1997)). Still there has been limited empirical evidence for the effects of private information due to absence of mandatory disclosure in private companies on firm's financial and real outcomes. This paper takes a novel approach in which it differentiates between information environments of private and public companies using firm-level administrative dataset, the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR), which covers a large sample of manufacturing, mining, retail, and wholesale trade firms since 1977. First, this paper uses the QFR merged with other publicly available databases (CRSP-Compustat and others) to decompose external financing used for investment into debt issuance (e.g bank vs non-bank debt, short-term vs long-term debt), equity issuance and sales of financial assets for privately and publicly owned companies in the US. Second, it estimates the relative contribution of private ownership and access to corporate debt markets to the components of external financing, controlling for firm specific observable characteristics. Third, this paper quantitatively evaluates the effects of changes in disclosure regulation on the costs of external financing for private and public firms using difference-in-difference analysis. Finally, the paper sheds light on the relationship between firm ownership and external funds volatility through the differences in debt maturity structure."
