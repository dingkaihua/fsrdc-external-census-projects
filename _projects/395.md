abstract: "The purpose of this proposal is to examine the quality of the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 Census of Services data for legal services firms on payroll by occupation, to determine whether one can combine revenue and payroll data to infer partner compensation, and to assess whether the manner in which the Bureau collects the occupation and payroll data produces distorted estimates in its publications. We then plan to use the Census microdata to investigate how the organization of legal services – in particular, firms’ hierarchical structure – has changed over time, characterize the distribution of wages in this industry and how it has changed over time, and analyze relationships between changes in hierarchies and changes in the wage distribution. The latter will lead to a better understanding of wage inequality not only in legal services, but in human-capital-intensive sectors (such as services) more broadly. The project will benefit Census programs in several ways. First, the project centers around the payroll by occupation data, which to our knowledge have not been used by CES staff. In the course of our project, we will learn the strengths and weaknesses of these data and communicate them to Census staff. These data have the potential to be a valuable resource to researchers investigating wage inequality, but if the responses to current questions are low-quality, the questions should either be changed or discontinued. Second, the Census has published estimates of the number of partners and associate lawyers for the U.S. and for select MSAs in recent Census years except 1997. These estimates have been somewhat misleading because they are based on definitions of “partners” and “associates” that differ from conventional uses of these terms in the industry. We plan to assess the magnitude of the distortion this produces, and create alternative estimates that are based on conventional definitions of “partners” and “associates.” Third, we would enhance the data we work with in two ways. We would link them over time, and provide alternative estimates of the number of partners and associates at each individual establishment in our data. These augmented datasets would be available to Census researchers."
