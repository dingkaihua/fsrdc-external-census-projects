abstract: "Sample surveys are a crucial source of information about the state of public health and people’s quality of life. Moreover, they provide an efficient way to identify and monitor illness and disability trends and track progress toward achieving the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Health Protection Goals. Increasingly, this information is being demanded in the form of small area statistics to monitor health trends and support policy decisions in small geographic areas, including those that are typically underrepresented in large-scale data collection projects. However, the CDC is often prevented from releasing small area identifiers in public-use datasets because the data do not satisfy certain disclosure restrictions. This research tests and evaluates a new method for generating public-use micro-level datasets that contain enough geographical detail to permit small area estimation without compromising the confidentiality of survey respondents. The method uses the observed survey data to fit a statistical imputation model that generates synthetic data records, which comprise the public-use data records. The synthetic data are generated to emulate the observed data and preserve important statistical properties of the observed data. Moreover, the synthetic data can account for the hierarchical clustering structure associated with multiple levels of geography; thus, permitting data users to perform various geographical analyses with a single dataset. Confidentiality protection is greatly enhanced because no actual data values are released to the public. The proposed methodology is tested and evaluated using confidential data from the National Health Interview Survey. Synthetic versions of this data source will be generated for key variables relevant to national health objectives. Various parametric and non-parametric imputation models capable of handling different variable types will be investigated."
