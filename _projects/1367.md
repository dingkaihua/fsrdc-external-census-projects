abstract: "This research seeks to understand how transit improvements affect the commuting behaviors of individuals and the location decisions of business establishments. Many U.S. cities are making substantial investments in expanding their public transit systems and promoting transit-oriented developments in hopes of reducing vehicle miles driven and in making neighborhoods more compact, economically vibrant, and transit accessible. The researchers will perform before-after, experimental or quasi-experimental analyses that can better illuminate the causal impact of transportation infrastructure investments on the economy and society. This is a two-phase process. In phase one, they analyze patterns of commuting behavior before and after the opening of new light rail transit (LRT) stations. They construct a quasi-experimental setting by using the American Community Survey (ACS) microdata and the propensity score matching technique. In phase two, they study the location behavior of business establishments due to LRT openings by analyzing microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) for three metropolitan areas: Dallas, Los Angeles, and Charlotte."
