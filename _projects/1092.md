abstract: "This project studies changes in Native American economic development as indicated by average incomes and measures of income inequality over the past several decades. The broad aim is to understand today's large differences in economic development between different tribes and between different reservations, rather than between different Native American individuals. First, this project estimates the effect of local governance on differences in average incomes among reservations. Second, it estimates the dynamics of income inequality and income growth across reservations and tribes. This requires building aggregate tribal and reservation characteristics from individual records in the Decennial Census and American Community Survey data."
