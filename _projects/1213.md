abstract: "This research continues work conducted under prior projects, conducting both cross-sectional and time series analyses of the underlying causes of changes in the distributions of production and energy efficiency. The principal analytic approach will be the application of frontier production functions and related procedures. Prior projects have successfully implemented these methods for selected industrial sectors."
