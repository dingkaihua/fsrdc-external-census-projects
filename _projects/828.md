abstract: "We propose a series of related analyses to understand the nature of technology-related organizational capital. Our first analysis attempts to gain further insight into the organizational innovations wrought by Enterprise-Resource-Planning (ERP) systems on the economy. By combining Census data sets with our ERP data from Harte Hanks and SAP, we can study how ERP systems have affected organizational change at both the plant and the firm level. Among firms that adopted ERP systems, how did their operations change? Which plants were closed and how was production reallocated? A purpose of this analysis is to examine what internal changes differentiated the most successful implementers of this new technology from the ones that were less successful.
Our other analyses concern the relationship between IT and the dynamic nature of the U.S. economy. The first phenomenon we want to explore in this stream of research is that of persistent firm heterogeneity. Are there greater and more persistent differences in performance between the leading and lagging firms in IT-intensive industries? We are also interested in whether there is greater “Schumpeterian” creative destruction in the most IT-intensive industries. Do the most productive firms in one period generate a greater share of output in the next period? Does the answer change depending on the intensity of IT usage in the industry? Are there more firm births and deaths in these industries? We are also interested in further exploring the relationship between IT and firm size, and examine the distribution of employment in industries by size and IT usage."
