abstract: "There is substantial dispersion in productivity across establishments in the United States. Management is an important factor in explaining differences in productivity, as is the role of economic uncertainty and firm expectations, which drive micro and macro performance. This research will quantify the roles of these factors and evaluate their causes and effects, using data from the Management and Organizational Practices Survey, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Census of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database, and other economic censuses and surveys. We will evaluate management practices and uncertainty across plants, firms, regions, and industries; examine channels through which management and uncertainty affect performance; and identify key factors driving uncertainty, as well as the adoption of better management practices in organizations. This analysis will allow us to evaluate whether establishments that have more structured management, more stable organizational environments, and better forecasting have superior performance, less short-termism, and less sensitivity to transitory shocks.
