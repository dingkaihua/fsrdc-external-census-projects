abstract: "This study chooses models to best forecast several inequality measures, provide short-term forecasts, and examine the changing nature of the income distribution over the course of a year, as affected by survey design and business cycles. This research builds off a preliminary exercise with public-use data from the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to model and forecast income inequality. Extending that analysis with the use of restricted-access CPS data will improve earlier income inequality measures. Internally topcoded data will enable the researcher to accurately model the income distribution and provide better forecasts, as the majority of the changes in income inequality have occurred in the top income percentiles, i.e., precisely those data which are topcoded. This research also examines how the income distribution changes over the course of the year. The researcher will compare results obtained from the CPS March supplement to the rolling data available from the American Community Survey, administered monthly. Given the timing of the CPS survey (shortly before the tax filing deadline) and the number of questions on various income sources for the past calendar year, estimates obtained using the CPS are judged to most accurately represent the true income distribution of the United States."
