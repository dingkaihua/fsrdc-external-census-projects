abstract: "This project will revamp existing documentation for the 1990 and 2000 decennial census micro data files currently available at Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The improved documentation will include information on the additional variables and codes available to researchers in the Census Bureauâ€™s Research Data Centers as well as relabel already publicly available variables to match internal documentation. Documentation also will include elements such as procedural histories, enumerator instructions, enumeration forms, and descriptive text from published Census Bureau volumes that explain how data are organized, details tabulation methods, and provides other information useful to users."
