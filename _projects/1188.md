abstract: "This project estimates individual-level suicide risk within the general population for sixteen states during the years 2005-2011 using person-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), which compiles follow-back information on nearly all suicides occurring in roughly one third of U.S. states. Appropriate combination of these datasets generates a cross-sectional sample that provides adequate power for statistical hypothesis tests and permits joint examination of individual- and community-level risk factors. This project aims to refit models on a dataset constructed using restricted-access ACS records containing county of residence. This increased geographic specificity may enhance previous findings, which include several individual-community interaction effects."
