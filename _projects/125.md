abstract: "This research will empirically analyze how dynamic considerations affect competition among firms in concentrated markets.  When firms compete over time, they have more potential profit-maximizing strategies at their disposal.  For example, in markets where sunk entry costs are high, firms may overinvest in initial capacity to deter subsequent entry.  If additional firms fail to enter the market as a result, the incumbent can maintain its market power over time.  Similarly, where there is uncertainty about the profitability of entry opportunities, potential entrants may learn about markets by looking at the prices existing firms charge.  An incumbent might charge a lower than optimal price in early periods to signal to potential entrants that profits in this market would be low.  Such strategies involve firms bearing costs initially (through high set-up costs or sub-optimal profits), but enjoying excess profits through market power in several subsequent years."
