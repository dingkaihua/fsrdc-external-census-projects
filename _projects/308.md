abstract: "The purpose of this proposal is threefold. First, we intend to extend prior work matching COMPUSTAT data to the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) to perform a data cross check and comparative analysis for consistency. This work builds off a currently active project by the principal investigators that will perform the basic matching work and will write a technical memorandum summarizing findings. This proposal will use that work in an extension to identify potential sources and explanations for the cases where data do not coincide. These discrepancies will be systematically categorized. Second, we will investigate the relationship between corporate governance and plant performance. Twenty years ago the term “corporate governance" did not exist in the English language. In the last two decades, however, corporate governance issues have gained a prominent role in the academic literature. In spite of the importance of the topic and the magnitude of the interests at stake, there is very little empirical evidence on what the effects of corporate governance are and what constitutes “good” and “bad” governance. For this purpose we will build on the LRD-COMPUSTAT match and use ownership concentration and governance variables from CD-Spectrum to investigate the relationship between firm performance and governance."
