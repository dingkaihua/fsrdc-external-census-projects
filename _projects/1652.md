abstract: "What factors determine the adaptive capacity of organizations or the economy, when faced with unanticipated disruptive events? This research examines how the performance of establishments, firms, and the economy is affected by unanticipated shocks, including natural disasters and business cycle movements. This research aims to discern the characteristics of plants, firms, and local economies that determine their capacity to effectively respond – through adjustments in behavior, resource utilization, and technologies – to disruptions. Furthermore, this research will examine how responses to disruptions differ depending on the frequency and intensity of the disruption. For example, economic disasters such as recessions are infrequent, affect everyone, and are costly to the economy. There have only been five since the 1970s, but they have been widely studied and documented to be highly damaging. In contrast, natural disasters are more frequent in occurrence, local to certain geographies, and exhibit large variation in the extent of damage. While the economy-wide impact of natural disasters has also been studied, there exists limited plant- and firm-level evidence on the consequences of such frequent, unpredictable disasters; on the extent to which their impact differs from the repercussions of economic disasters; and the various characteristics that may determine the capacity to respond and adapt to uncertain and disruptive events.
