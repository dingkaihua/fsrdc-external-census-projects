abstract: "This project will examine the determinants and consequences of filing for personal bankruptcy in the United States. The research will make use of the Decennial Census of Population, American Community Survey, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) panels, combined with external data on personal bankruptcy filings from 1998-2008. The researchers will measure the correlates of bankruptcy, describing the particular demographic characteristics of households that declare bankruptcy. They will also calculate trends in these demographics, describing for the first time how the sample of Americans who declare bankruptcy has changed over time, especially since the change in the federal bankruptcy law in 2005."
