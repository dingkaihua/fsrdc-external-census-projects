abstract: "This project uses nonpublic data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to study the eﬀect of access to short-term personal loans on household welfare, particularly among low-income populations. Speciﬁcally, it will estimate the impact of loan access on the following outcomes: diﬃculty paying rent and utilities, eviction, termination of utilities due to default, delay of needed health care, and household debt. The measure of loan access, geographic proximity to payday loan stores, depends upon fairly detailed information on house-hold location (census tract and county), necessitating access to nonpublic geographic identiﬁers in the SIPP. By investigating a determinant of economic well-being among low-income individuals, this project fulﬁlls one of the Census Bureau’s goals in conducting the SIPP: to provide improved measures of economic well-being. If short-term borrowing does inﬂuence welfare, then this would suggest a useful revision to the SIPP, whereby the Census Bureau could oﬀer a clearer picture of the ﬁnancial situation of low-income individuals by inquiring about payday loan usage among SIPP respondents."
