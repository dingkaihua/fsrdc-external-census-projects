abstract: "Firms in recent years have changed their corporate payout strategies and have gone more global in their activities. This project investigates the relationship between the international activities of a firm, its profitability, payout strategies, and capital accumulation. The analysis is carried out on three categories of firms according to their payout strategy: (1) dividend payers and regular repurchasers, (2) regular repurchasers, and (3) occasional repurchasers. It starts with an assessment of the relationship between global activities and the observed corporate payout behavior, focusing on the international characteristics of firms, controlling for other firm, product, and country characteristics. Then, it assesses the relationship between global activities and corporate profitability for these three groups of firms. The last part investigates whether the increase in payments coincides with the decrease in capital accumulation and employment."
