abstract: "Despite celebrating the 50th anniversary of the FDA approval of the oral contraceptive pill, significant scholarly debate remains about the role that the Pill played in the dramatic demographic shifts of the 1960s. Estimating the causal impact of the Pill has been difficult because of the coincidence of its release with the peak of the baby boom, the rise of the women's movement, and many other social changes that render standard inter-temporal comparisons invalid. Bailey (2010) developed a quasi-experimental empirical strategy to address these problems. Specifically, she uses state-level variation in anti-obscenity "Comstock laws" which made the Pill illegal in 24 states, in conjunction with the timing of the introduction of the Pill in 1957 and the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Connecticut's Comstock statute in 1965 with Griswold v. Connecticut. This project proposes to use data from both the publicly available IPUMS and the restricted-access microdata from the decennial censuses to pursue three specific scientific aims:  (1) To use individual county-identifiers to develop and test a distance-based regression discontinuity methodology for estimating the impact of the birth control pill on completed fertility; (2) To use individual county-identifiers and the methodology in (1) to quantify the impact of the birth control pill on completed fertility, marital outcomes, child quality, and female labor force participation; and (3) To use this methodology to examine the impact of the birth control pill on disparities in these outcomes by race and education level."
