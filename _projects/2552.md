abstract: "Hospitals are an important driver of local economic growth in rural communities. Hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, help communities maintain a high quality of life and a healthy workforce, which are important factors for firms choosing a location. In this project, we will describe changes in hospital markets and how those changes affect economic growth, particularly in rural communities. Using data from the Longitudinal Business Database, the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database, and the County Business Patterns Business Register from 1987 through 2021 as available, we will examine the short-term and long-term effects that hospital entries and exits have on the number of establishments located in a community and the level of employment and payroll for both non-hospital health care sectors and non-health care sectors. We will also use a double hurdle model to estimate the impact that a hospital has on firm location decisions. This model allows us to measure both the probability that firms would not locate in a community without a hospital and the probability that firms would not locate in the community even if a hospital were present. Estimates of probabilities will be provided for the each 2-digit NAICS code."
