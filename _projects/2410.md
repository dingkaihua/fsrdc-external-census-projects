abstract: "This study seeks to estimate the effect of place (defined by the combination of built, natural, and social environment) on people's energy consumption, and then to use these estimates to assess the economic efficiency (maximization of the benefit-cost ratio) and economic incidence (the distribution of costs and benefits across demographic groups) of government-induced energy price variation. The focus of this study will be on the interaction between the carbon externality market failure and the public goods market failure. Acemoglu et al (2012, 2016) explore this interaction in the case of the global public goods failure of R&D under-provision and show that a carbon tax alone is not a cost-effective solution for reducing carbon emissions; however, the efficiency impacts of the interaction between local public goods and carbon externalities has not yet been studied."
