abstract: "The high failure rates, low profits, and small employment sizes of black- and Hispanic-owned businesses, relative to their white and Asian counterparts, are of concern to many policy makers.  To date, we do not fully understand why black- and Hispanic-owned firms lag behind white and Asian-owned firms.  In the proposed research project, I will use data from the Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) to explore the role that intergenerational links in self-employment play in contributing to racial differences in small business outcomes, such as failures, sales, profits, and employment size.  A careful examination of how family business experience differs by race and ethnicity may uncover some answers.  The inability of blacks and Hispanics to acquire business experience may be at the root of their limited success in business ownership.  Furthermore, family-owned businesses have historically provided a route out of poverty and into long-term, sometimes intergenerational, self-sufficiency for many families.  A better understanding of this process may shed light on why some families are not successful in their small businesses."
