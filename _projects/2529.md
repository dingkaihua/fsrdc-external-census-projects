abstract: "Vision loss and blindness are global public health concerns. In 2015, an estimated 216.6 million people had moderate to severe visual impairment and 36 million people were blind. In the United States specifically, in 2017, it has been estimated that 7.73 million Americans, 2.37 percent of the total population, are currently living with some form of uncorrectable vision loss in their better-seeing eye and 1.10 million, 0.34% of the total population, are blind. However, there are still substantial gaps in knowledge regarding the burden of vision loss and blindness in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to use vision loss data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to produce model-based, county-level estimates of the prevalence of vision loss and blindness in the U.S. stratified by sex, age, race/ethnicity and group quarters to highlight variation across the country. With more detailed and granular knowledge of the burden of vision loss and blindness, more evidence-based public health policy decisions can be made."
