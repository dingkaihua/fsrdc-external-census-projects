abstract: "To best investigate how commute time may change, and thereby (hypothetically) improve the socio-economic quality of life for working people, particularly low-income workers, I propose to isolate and expand on one factor that is not considered in enough depth in the literature: exogenous residential change, more commonly referred to as a forced move, or displacement. The hypothesis I wish to test is whether the displaced, particularly the low-income population forced to move, face longer commutes, measured by time, post-displacement than they faced pre-displacement.
I plan to conduct my study across two different research question. First, how do exogenous housing shocks that force an individual to move residences - operationalized through public housing eradication in the HOPE VI program - impact a worker's commute time, measured as a change in their commute time pre versus post displacement. Second, using transportation models, geospatial methods, and new, open-source trip routing algorithms, I will explore how the effect of exogenous housing displacement may differentially effect commute time when it is modeled across public transit, private automobile, or other transport modes (cycling, walking, etc.). 
The methodology will generally follow a quasi-experimental research design, that will seek to employ the benefits of individual-level, panel data to isolate the effects of an exogenous independent variable (displacement from residence via public housing eradication, conducted as part of, but not limited to the HOPE VI program) on a dependent variable (commute time). The model specification will be a difference-in-difference regression model that takes advantage of the panel data's structure. Furthermore, my focus on a residential move due to assumed exogenous reasons (rather than an individual's desire to move) will allow for isolating possible causality in changes to commute time."
