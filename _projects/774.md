abstract: "This project will ascertain oral health among rural and urban populations by estimating the rate of dental sealant use among urban and rural children, and in particular rural minority children, using two separate waves of the same Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) topical module.  In so doing, the project will benefit the SIPP by furthering a primary purpose of the survey - measuring the effectiveness of federal, state, and local programs. Comparison of results from this project to concurrent results using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data will specifically benefit the SIPP data collection program as described in detail below. Findings will further benefit the Bureau by providing an outline for future use of the SIPP to assess questions related to health care, and by reporting population estimates of the level of dental sealant use in rural and urban populations."
