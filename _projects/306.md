abstract: "This study will characterize how changes in political environments from 1963–2000 influenced the employment and investment decisions, including technology adoption, of manufacturing establishments. Special attention will be given to the impact of elections themselves, including expectations of the candidates’ ideologies. In the face of uncertain elections, are plants more reserved in their hiring or investing behavior? Do the victories of candidates with very strong ideologies lead to discrete adjustments in anticipation of future conditions? Three econometric specifications will be considered: standard cross-sectional regressions; a state border discontinuity analysis; and a longitudinal analysis using a balanced 1973–1988 panel of Annual Survey of Manufacturing plants. Use of detailed plant data housed at the Center for Economic Studies is essential for isolating the impact of local politics on establishment behavior, employing a border effects analysis that requires county identification, and characterizing the different reactions of local, single-plant firms versus establishments part of large, regionally-diverse enterprises. 
This project is a response to the July 2001 Research Opportunities at the Census Bureau publication that requests proposals studying how higher-order moments (i.e., skewness, kurtosis) of the cross-section distribution of investment and employment variables should be made publicly available. To identify the influences of regional political environments and elections, I will need to calculate these higher-order moments for individual states and perhaps smaller county/MSA divisions. In a technical memo, I will be able to characterize the best candidate metrics for release from the perspectives of the Census Bureau and potential researchers, the limits to disaggregating geographically these moments (either due to confidentiality concerns or data quality issues), and if and how these higher-order moments should be calculated in non-Census of Manufacturers years. Additional benefits are also identified in the proposal."
