abstract: "This research proposes to study managerial incentives in the mutual fund industry by primarily investigating two questions: First, does the labor market for mutual fund managers discipline poorly performing managers? Second, how is managerial compensation determined? 
To answer these questions, the researchers will request a number of internal databases, most notably Longitudinal Employer-Household Database (LEHD), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), and Compustat-SSEL Bridge files; and for external databases, Morningstar, LexisNexis Public Records, MFLinks, CRSP, and Thompson Reuters. The researchers either have subscription or membership for all external databases. All of the internal databases are requested for the years between 1990 and the latest year available, with the exception of LBD used to more accurately pin down firm age.  
The research will benefit the Census as the researchers plan to conduct a systematic assessment of the firm age variable by statistically comparing the Morningstar data with relevant data from various US Census programs. Morningstar provides a unique and an accurate way of calculating firm age for these mutual fund companies, which involves using a combination of advanced textual analysis to extract mutual funds' prospectus and tracking using a variety of different methods the inception dates of each fund affiliated with a mutual fund company. This comparison will shed light on the current methodology employed by Census to calculate its firm age variable in the LBD, i.e., firm age is counted as the age of the oldest establishment."
