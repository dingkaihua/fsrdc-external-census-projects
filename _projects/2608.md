abstract: "Over the last ten years, research on worker mobility has uncovered a number of facts about the direction and composition of worker flows in the US economy. For example, Goetz et al. (2015) found that workers tend to move from older to younger firms, and Crane (2014) discovered that workers with higher previous wages tend to move from slower growing to faster growing firms. However, little work has been done to investigate the wage recruitment strategies causing so many high wage workers to move to younger, faster-growing firms. This project fills the gap in the literature by investigating the wage recruitment strategies that young, high growth firms use to attract and ultimately poach workers from other firms. Using linked employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics and Longitudinal Business Database, the researchers of this project plan to decompose the starting salary of workers using the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (AKM 1999) model of additive worker and firm fixed effects. Moreover, the researchers will use the AKM 1999 model to estimate the returns to tenure at firms of different ages and growth trajectories. Finally, the researchers will use information on the number of hours worked for workers in the LEHD who were also surveyed by the American Community Survey to compare the starting hourly wages and hourly wage growth of workers at younger, faster growing firms with those of workers at older, slower-growing firms."
