abstract: "This study uses the Characteristics of Business Ownership (CBO), the Survey of Business Ownership (SBO), the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), and the Business Register (BR) to examine the relationship between age and entrepreneurship. This research derives from a common question among scholars and practitioners: What owner traits predict business performance (e.g., employment, sales, profits, survival)? This study contributes to this research by using census data to test the strength of owner age in predicting business performance and by measuring the extent to which this relationship changed between 1982 and 2002. This research will obtain sales, employees, other available firm data for 2002, and the survival experience of the firm through 2006, or the latest available year. This study will also link the firms to improve the measures of business survival beyond the snapshots taken in 1986 and 1996. This research will use the linked data for longitudinal analyses of owner age and business performance. This will contribute to the understanding of business formation, early lifecycle dynamics of firms and the precursors to job creation in the U.S. economy. The project will create estimates of the impact of age of business owners on the performance of small businesses. It will also develop linkages between the SBO, the CBO, and the newly created ILBD. Using those linkages, it will enrich the 2002 SBO with variables which were not included in that survey, but were included in the earlier CBO surveys. This will enhance both the value of the 2002 SBO because of the inclusion of the new variables and the value of the earlier CBO surveys because of the existence of comparable data in another year. It will also enhance all three surveys by providing measures of firm survival and the transition from nonemployer to employer status."
