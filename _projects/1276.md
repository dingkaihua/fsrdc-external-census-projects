abstract: "It is well established that most entering firms start small and take time to grow. However, less is known about the process of firm growth. This project attempts to understand the determinants of firm growth by identifying demand shocks separately from supply-side factors. Understanding the process of firm growth is important since it has a large effect on the allocation of resources across firms, and hence in the extent of allocative efficiency, which previous research suggests can explain a substantial portion of observed differences in output per worker across countries. The goal of this project is to understand the dynamics of firms by exploring alternative mechanisms of firm growth that do not depend solely on supply-side factors and to assess their quantitative relevance. To assess the contribution of demand side factors to firm growth, this project hopes to identify shocks that make it easier for a firm to sell to customers, relaxing the demand-side constraint to growth. The primary strategy for identifying demand shocks is to exploit variation in “customer access” across time, geographic space, and product lines. For instance, a firm that is exogenously assigned better access to customers should grow faster, if access to customers were a relevant constraint to growth."
