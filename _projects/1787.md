abstract: "This research estimates (i) the effect of Affirmative Action regulation on the probability that a new hire in private sector firms meeting the size requirements is a minority, (ii) the effect of legal charges filed citing sex, race, color or national origin discrimination on the probability that a new hire is a minority, and (iii) the effect of working in an Affirmative Action regulated firm on current and future wages. This project will impute federal contractor status and racial composition reported in the Equal Employment Opportunity Employer Information Reports, to private sector firms in the LEHD database meeting the size requirements to fill these forms under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition, it will assign a count of discrimination charges filed with the EEOC against federally contracted firms. "
