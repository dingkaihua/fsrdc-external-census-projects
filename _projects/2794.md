abstract: "Over one million U.S. workers are directly affected by involuntary labor force reductions each year. Concerns about providing these displaced workers with sufficient time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment motivated the adoption of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), which established a rule that requires employers to give affected employees at least 60 days' notice of such an employment action. Such layoff notices could benefit disadvantaged households, by allowing them to supplement temporary decreases in earnings through a credit channel. Alternatively, by giving workers time to self-insure, layoff notices could unintendedly exacerbate debt problems for disadvantaged households, which has important consequences for households, lenders, and the overall labor market. Using data on roughly 50,000 mass layoffs in the U.S. (from 2000 to 2018) obtained from WARN notices, TransUnion monthly credit report data, and the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics database, we estimate whether credit-constrained workers are better off when they are warned of a layoff."
