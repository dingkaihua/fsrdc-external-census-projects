abstract: "This project studies the decomposition of productivity growth into the respective contributions of entering firms, exiting firms, surviving firms as a whole, and market share shifts between survivors, using a new decomposition method (the Dynamic Olley-Pakes Decomposition). The study will document the extent to which this productivity decomposition differs across different sectors of the economy (e.g., whether the contribution of net entry to productivity growth in the manufacturing sector is roughly the same as the contribution of net entry to productivity growth in the construction sector) and whether other aspects of the reallocation process (like the role of financial constraint on firm exit) are different across different sectors.
