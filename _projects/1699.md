abstract: "This project examines the extent to which collusion breakup influences firm-level decisions (on price, quantity, entry, exit, input usage, output, investment, and innovation) and market structure. This has important implications both for aggregate economic welfare and also for certain sets of consumers and producers. Cartel breakups provide a unique opportunity to estimate the causal relationship between competition and innovation, as cartel breakup is generally unexpected and brings abrupt changes in the level of competition in the relevant market. There have been more than five hundred cartel breakups over the past few decades, making it possible to run large sample quantitative analysis and make causal inferences. The availability of Census microdata enables the researchers to examine various aspects of investments and innovations in response to increased competition. "
