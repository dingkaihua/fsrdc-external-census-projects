abstract: "This project analyzes whether there is any statistical evidence that the tuition subsidies granted to those living in community taxing districts (CCTD) in Texas are capitalized into housing prices and rental rates. This research will analyze how changes in taxing district boundaries over time changes the college tuition individuals face and their probability of attending college. The project will also assess the robustness of earlier findings using alternative estimation techniques to account for both college proximity and the distance individuals live from CCTD boundaries."
