abstract: "Radiation is recognized as having an influence on human outcomes, especially in relation to infant and child development. In Japan and Europe, events ranging from the 1945 Hiroshima atomic explosion and the 1986 Chernobyl accident to the very recent 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant damage incident have drawn long-lasting attention to the effect of radiation on public health. In the United States, numerous nuclear weapon tests have been conducted and contributed considerable radioactive fallouts over the country; however, no study on the influence of radioactive fallouts on U.S. general population has been done. Combining radiation data in the 1960s, cohort survey response from ACS, CPS, SIPP, and administrative records from the SSA, we examine the impact of prenatal radiation exposure on long-term education attainment and labor market performance exploiting county-level variation in the timing and severity of radiation. Insights from the medical literature suggest that cognitive development is most susceptible to ionizing radiation during the second trimester, we thus expect human outcomes to be negatively impacted if the subjects were exposed to high doses of radiation during such critical gestation periods."
