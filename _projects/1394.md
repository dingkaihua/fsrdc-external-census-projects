abstract: "This project will assess the social and economic landscape of single-parent households and their relationship with the non-resident parent, a subject of great importance given the large fraction of children born into out-of-wedlock households. The project also proposes to analyze the quality of marriage and fertility data contained in the Census Bureau's internal-use Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Specifically, the researcher will analyze the quality of aggregate marriage and fertility statistics in SIPP as compared to those based on natality data from birth certificates published in the National Vital Statistics System; study the reliability of identifying “shotgun” marriages in the public-use SIPP, without knowledge of the month of marriage or the month of birth as is available in the internal-use SIPP; analyze the aggregate social and economic behavior of non-resident fathers, including their labor force participation, and their time and child support expenditures on their children; and analyze the aggregated reports by mothers of child support receipt compared to aggregated reports by fathers of child support expenditures.
