abstract: "This project will investigate the use of big data machine learning methods to  generate estimates of the population of Research and Development (R&D) performing firms and establishments, and of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) workers. The project includes analyses to improve R&D survey data, identification of postdoc and graduate student survey respondents, analyses of the labor market for STEM PhDs and postdocs, estimates of the regional economic impacts of federally funded science, the economic impact of science and engineering workers and their role in mediating R&D spillovers among firms, and the impact of technology on older workers."
