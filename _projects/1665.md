abstract: "Managers adjust labor turnover based on firm internal operational performance metrics while employees voluntarily leave or switch jobs, which in turn affects firm performance. It has been a challenge to link labor turnover to firm performance because the benefits and costs of labor turnover are hard to quantify. Besides, firm performance is very hard to measure in general because it is affected both by financial factors outside firms and operational efficiencies inside firms. This research empirically determines the sign and magnitude of the correlation between labor turnover and firm operational performance. First, the project examines inventory turnover, a financial and operational metric indicating how fast a retailer is generating value compared to its average inventory level. By controlling for its correlation with related financial metrics, adjusted inventory turnover (AIT) is estimated to measure firm operational performance. AIT has been shown to predict future financial performance, including sales, earnings, and stock return. Second, this relationship varies across retailers of different labor intensity. By controlling for retailer characteristics, the correlation of labor turnover and firm performance is estimated, and the exacerbating or mitigating effect of labor intensity is investigated. Moreover, this research tests the hypothesis that such a relation is non-linear. This project uses various Census Bureau datasets with U.S. retailers from 1999 to 2012."
