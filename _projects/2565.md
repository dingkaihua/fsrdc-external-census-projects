abstract: "I will investigate the question: Does a more educated workforce in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)  enhances the effectiveness of R&D spending by companies in that location and lead to improved firm performance.? The answer to this question has very different implications.  If a more educated workforce leads to increased R&D, then locations (cities) may need to attract a more educated workforce by, for example, investing in local universities.  On the other hand, if more R&D leads to a more educated workforce, then locations may need to invest in R&D tax credits or other incentives for companies.  The major datasets needed for this research are:  Business Research & Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), Longitudinal Business Database,  Census of Manufactures (CMF), Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM).  This project will develop measures of accuracy and possible sources of error in the BRDIS survey. To accomplish this task, an algorithm will be written that will use the establishment's industry code to classify firms as single R&D locations, multiple R&D locations, or un-categorized R&D location. I expect to find that R&D expenditures has a positive relationship to the level of education of the workforce in that location. Furthermore, I expect to find that productivity, stock returns and cash flows of firms located in areas with a more educated workforce perform better because of R&D."
