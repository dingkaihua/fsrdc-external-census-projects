abstract: "This project proposes to answer the following research questions: (1) What role do supply chains play in shaping wage inequality? (2) How do these supply chains vary by firm productivity levels, and is there a systematic differential response of these supply chains to international trade shocks? (3) If supply chains determine wages, then there will be nominal wage consequences for workers in all sectors of the importing economy. How much do these supply chain changes that arise due to trade shocks spillover into non-import-competing sectors? (4) Within all sectors, are there heterogeneous responses to trade shocks that vary by firm productivity and what are the implications of this heterogeneity? 
We will use firm-level statistics to produce population estimates of how supply chain formation changes in the United States resulting from China joining the World Trade Organization affected workers in both import-competing and non-import-competing sectors. We will also estimate how variables such as sector-level employment, unemployment, and the overall wage distribution change in response to shifts in trade policy. We will do this by estimating various reduced-form specifications for wages as a function of firm-firm linkages at the establishment and firm level. We will also estimate parameters of a double-sided matching model where firms must match not only with employees to produce output, but they also must endogenously form relationships with other firms to acquire inputs for production."
