abstract: "We plan to:  1) calculate descriptive statistics to identify differences across minority and nonminority populations with respect to demographic characteristics, benefits received, work patterns, and rates of return from Social Security;  2) estimate a tobit model of the percent of total assets invested in risky assets, as a function of race and other characteristics;  3) estimate probit models of the probability of receiving disability or survivor benefits as a function of race and other characteristics; 4)  calculate "moneysworth" measures such as a rate of return to Social Security, benefits net of taxes paid to Social Security, and a benefit/tax ratio, done separately for minorities and nonminorities.

We plan to pool the 1990 and 1991 matched SIPP panels in order to increase our sample of minority households and make the minority breakdowns possible.  As soon as they are available we will do similar analyses with the matched 1992-1993 SIPP panels.  We also plan to use the 1984 matched SIPP panel to explore the possibility of analyzing lifetime returns to Social Security on a sample of deceased beneficiaries."
