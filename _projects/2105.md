abstract: "This project seeks to examine an important mechanism through which immigrants are absorbed into U.S. local labor markets by fully explicating the link between immigrants and business turnover. Initial work using publicly-available data, presented below, suggests a causal link between immigrants and the number of establishments in geographic areas between 1980 and 2010. In this project, we aim to understand the role that this link plays in absorbing immigrants into local labor markets compared to other adjustment mechanisms, such as increases in firm scale, native worker wage adjustments, and changes in firm production technology. We will also examine the characteristics of these immigrant-linked businesses in terms of size, industry, and immigrant ownership using restricted-access Census microdata. Finally, we seek to understand the specific consequences of this net business creation adjustment mechanism to local labor market dynamics."
