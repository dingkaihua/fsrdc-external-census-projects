abstract: "This project will use the National Employer Survey (NES), and especially the NES 2000 survey, together with a number of other U.S. Census Bureau datasets, to examine the incidence of various innovative human resource practices (such as employee involvement plans, organizational learning practices, nonstandard employment arrangements, and new personnel practices), the factors that determine their use, and the consequences of such use for organizational and individual outcomes (such as establishment performance, employee wages, and turnover).   This project will provide a number of benefits to the Census Bureau’s data programs, aside from the estimates of characteristics of populations.  Other benefits include assessing the NES’s unique methodology for surveying employees and identifying emerging employment issues—such as the extent to which those working in establishments are not employees of the establishment—that can be used to guide future surveys."
