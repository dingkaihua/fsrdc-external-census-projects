abstract: "Prior studies have investigated the effect of accounting fraud on various parties, including investors, top managers, consumers, and peer firms. However, the impact of accounting fraud on labor markets has received little attention, likely because of data limitations. The question this study addresses is whether the labor market outcomes of employees of accounting fraud firms could have been different if those firms had not been involved in accounting fraud. Using data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, Longitudinal Business Database, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Census of Manufactures, we examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. These data sets allow us to track employee information, such as wages and job switches, over time. To analyze the employment effects, we combine Census Bureau data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting. We find that, compared to a matched sample, employee wages decline during and after fraud, and that employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative after. During fraud, managers overinvest in labor. Frauds cause informational opacity, and fraudulent reports tend to indicate good prospects, encouraging employees to still join the firm. After the fraud is revealed and the overemployment is unwound, employee wages fall due to turnover, with related job-search challenges and losses of firm-specific investments, and the stigma associated with the fraud. We use various subsamples to provide evidence for these mechanisms, showing that labor market disruptions and stigma have meaningful and negative consequences for employees."
