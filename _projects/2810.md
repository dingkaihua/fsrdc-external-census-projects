abstract: "Using data from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), and Economic Census Microdata, we will use a linear regression model to investigate the effect of the worker cooperative form of firm ownership on a firm's adoption of labor-saving technology, comparing longitudinal changes in capital-labor ratios of worker cooperatives with those of a matched control group of traditional firms. In addition, LEHD data will allow us to compare cooperative employees to control-group employees; we will examine whether the profit sharing associated with cooperatives attracts higher-quality workers (using lifetime earnings as a proxy for quality).

Because worker cooperatives are not identified by the Census Bureau's public or non-public data, we must use data from other organizations to identify them. The U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC) has conducted a biennial census of cooperative firms since 2013; the names and addresses of firms in its public directory can be used to identify cooperatives in Census databases. We will also use the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SSEL) and County Business Patterns Business Register (CBPBR) to follow changes in the organization of multi-establishment firms, allowing us to track firms that have changed names and to control for the number of locations operated by each firm."
