abstract: "The goal of this project is to examine the underlying social determinants of agglomeration economies.  Specifically, we will use samples of workers drawn from the ACS and Decennial Census data to examine the effect of proximity to employment concentrations and firm activity more generally on wages, and use samples drawn from the Longitudinal Business Database and related data sets to estimate models of Total Factor Productivity (manufacturing only), employment growth and establishment formation as a function of surrounding economic activity.  Economic spillovers, one of Marshall's three major agglomerative forces, are thought to arise from social interactions between individuals when information and ideas are exchanged.  However, large amounts of evidence exist to suggest that the pattern of social interactions is not random, with individuals that share key human capital or demographic attributes often choosing to interact with each other more than with similarly situated individuals who differ on those attributes.  Therefore, we intend to examine the extent to which wages and establishment outcomes vary with the match between a firm's workers and the surrounding workforce.  When available, we intend to use existing matches between sampled workers in the ACS and Decennial Census with establishments in order to provide better controls for the match between each firm's workers and the attributes of surrounding workers.   Finally, given the focus on Economic spillovers, we also intend to investigate models that might capture learning where changes in wages over time and changes in firm total factor productivity are modeled as a function of the level of economic activity in the surrounding area."
