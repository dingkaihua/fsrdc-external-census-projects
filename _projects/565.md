abstract: "In this project, we will use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to produce estimates of the factors affecting employer-sponsored health insurance.  We will investigate the quality of the MEPS-IC data, and we will enhance the usefulness of the MEPS-IC by matching information from several other datasets to it.   Estimates will be primarily derived from multivariate models and will focus on the following six broad areas: employers’ decisions to offer insurance; employers’ decisions on the types of plans to offer employees; employees’ health insurance enrollment decisions; employers’ decisions on the structure of their contributions towards premiums; employers’ labor market responses to employer-sponsored health insurance; employers’ decisions with respect to health insurance eligibility rules."
