abstract: "What is the effect of ethnicity on entrepreneurial activity? The neo-classical perspective suggests that human capital, defined as education and work experience, explains entrepreneurial outcomes regardless of ethnicity. The ethnic entrepreneurship approach argues that ethnicity provides social capital, such as reciprocal obligations, which facilitates enterprise. Drawing on economic sociology, this study combines the human capital and ethnic entrepreneurship approaches by introducing a framework derived from Polanyi (1944). Following Polanyi, this research argues that societies are constituted by three forms of market integration: market-exchange, reciprocity, and redistribution. Under capitalism, the market-exchange relationship is the dominant form of economic integration. Secondary relationships of reciprocity and redistribution, however, exist alongside the primary exchange relationship and provide compensatory support in the face of market uncertainty or disadvantage. Using the 1990 and 2000 US Census and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners, this study proposes to examine the effects of primary and secondary relationships of market integration on entrepreneurial participation and economic success. This research provides evidence that reciprocal relationships, which generate social capital, contribute to an explanation of entrepreneurial participation. Yet, findings reveal that market-exchange relationships, constituted in part by human capital or class background, better explain entrepreneurial economic success, regardless of ethnicity. The analysis of the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners Survey will benefit the US Census Bureau in two ways. First, this proposed analysis will construct, verify, and improve the sampling frame for future Census and CBO (SBO) data collection. Second, this proposed analysis would provide estimates of a variety of understudied ethnic and racial group populations and characteristics of these populations."
