abstract: "Industrial energy demand typically involves base load consumption. As a result the industrial component of energy demand has important implications in evaluating energy infrastructure, i.e. oil, gas, electric power. There is growing concern that the energy infrastructure could be subject to both natural (e.g. storms or equipment failure) and manmade (e.g. terrorist) disruptions. To address the economic and human implications of such a disruption, planning agencies are taking a closer look at the energy infrastructure and its customers to assess its robustness and ability to continue vital functions as well as identify potential weaknesses. This project uses the LRD and MECS databases to estimate a distribution-company-level model of industrial energy demand for natural gas and electricity via a plant-level energy demand equation. An element unique to this study is the use of “establishment location” in a geographic information system (GIS) to create new, supplemental data on the relationship between the plant and the energy distribution system. These supplemental data are then used to improve the forecasting abilities of the econometric model. The benefits to the Census Bureau include 1) the creation of the GIS layers that can be used to access various data sources such as the LRD, MECS, and SSEL, in an intuitive visual mode which highlights spatial relationships, 2) the link across the LRD and MECS to create plant-level energy prices, and 3) the forecasting equations that can be used to impute non-response to energy questions in the ASM and MECS."
