abstract: "This project seeks to improve our understanding of the demographic and social processes that may affect responses to Census Bureau surveys. In particular, this project will examine responses to the race and Hispanic origin questions in the decennial censuses of 1960-2020 and the American Community Survey (ACS) of 2000-2023. The researcher will investigate demographic and social processes leading to longer-term changes in race and Hispanic origin responses (using non-linked decennial census files from 1960 to 2020, with supplementary data from the ACS and public data sources). The results will include estimates of populations who have changed race and/or Hispanic responses over the period. This project will also examine social and demographic processes leading to the choice of a race/Hispanic response for a child of an interracial marriage over the same period, generating estimates of characteristics of mixed-heritage populations giving each particular race/Hispanic response. Finally, this project will examine the demographic and social processes related to non-response among American Indians and Alaska Natives to the tribal affiliation question (within the race question) on the 1970-2020 decennial censuses and the 2000-2023 ACS. This research will utilize multiple multivariate regression approaches, as well as life table techniques, to estimate expected population sizes."
