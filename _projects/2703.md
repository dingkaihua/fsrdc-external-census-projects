abstract: "Given the steady growth in the number of U.S.-born children with parents from two different major ethno-racial categories, it is crucial to examine procedures for identifying mixed family backgrounds in census data.  Using the 2015-19 American Community Survey (ACS) sample data, this project will investigate the degree to which the identification of children from mixed family backgrounds is altered by adding information beyond the race and Hispanic-origin data stipulated for the children.  In a first step, the ancestry data provided for the children will be considered.  In a second step, the race, Hispanic-origin, and ancestry data for their parents will be added.  The use of the CHCK file will allow the analysis to include data for a sample of non-coresident fathers.  At each step, the children's ethno-racial classification will be reconsidered in light of any new descent information. A second major focus of the project is on the neighborhood contexts where mixed children grow up.  This choice is dictated by the critical role of social segregation in the transmission of inequalities from one generation to the next.   By merging the 2015-19 ACS file of census-tract characteristics with the individual children's records, we will estimate the characteristics of the neighborhoods where mixed children are growing up (e.g., percent of adults with college degrees) and compare them to the equivalent estimates for children belonging to unmixed groups (e.g, neighborhoods of Asian-white children compared to those of Asian-only children on the one hand and of non-Hispanic white children, on the other).   Using multivariate analyses, where neighborhood characteristics constitute the dependent variables, we will also compare mixed and unmixed ethno-racial categories, while controlling for individual and family characteristics, such as parental education and family income."
