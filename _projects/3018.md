abstract: "This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by producing population estimates examining the impact of Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) generosity on employment and wages. Utilizing merged Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data with other internal Census Bureau demographic datasets, the researchers will both reassess the existing literature on employment effects and provide credible estimates of the effect of this refundable tax credit on hourly wages. Two main identification difficulties exist for estimating the effects of the EITC - controlling for the effects of the economic environment and controlling for unobservable heterogeneity across individuals. The researchers will attempt to solve the first of these problems by utilizing local geographic variation in state EITC supplements across state borders after 2000. Using local geographic variation will allow the research to sidestep ongoing debates about the potential confounding effects of welfare reform and the booming economy during the major EITC reforms of the 1990s. In addition, the researchers will simultaneously match individuals with similar demographics and work histories to attempt to better control for individual heterogeneity as the LEHD contains individual-level variables which are not observable in other datasets. The ability to simultaneously control for the local economy (using local geographical variation in treatment) and simultaneously control for individual selection (by matching on wage and employment histories plus demographics) is feasible only with the LEHD data and will be best achieved by linking those data to the American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and/or Current Population Survey - Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). In addition to the LEHD data, the researchers also request access to these latter three datasets, associated Protected Identification Key (PIK) crosswalks with which to link between these datasets, and Numerical Identification (Numident) file data with which to identify deaths (pertinent events in the LEHD data that are not otherwise observable). The Master Address File-Auxiliary Reference File (MAF-ARF) and MAF Extract File (MAFX) are requested to provide more detailed information about housing units. With these merged data, the researchers will be able to obtain robust estimates of the aggregate effects of the EITC on labor market outcomes."
