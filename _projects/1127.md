abstract: "This project will empirically test a number of theories regarding firm characteristics and firm behavior (incentives to innovate), as well as firm characteristics and economic outcomes (the effectiveness of innovation). It will construct a new measure of R&D effectiveness, called RQ, which will allow one to test economic performance hypotheses for any firm with R&D activity (rather than just firms with patents), covering a broad swath of industries in the U.S. economy. This research will provide important advancements in the research of R&D determinants and outcomes, providing new estimates to the Census Bureau. "
