abstract: "This research analyzes the effects of federal Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits on worker-level outcomes, specifically educational attainment, cumulative earnings (wages), labor force participation, time-to-rehire, and sectoral reallocation (i.e., whether re-trained workers move to firms and industry of higher or lower relative productivity with respect to the firms from which they separated). TAA benefits – typically cash transfers for worker enrollment in (re)training programs – are awarded to workers that successfully demonstrate to the Department of Labor that their firm’s layoffs were caused by import competition with foreign competitors. This project also explores how the effects of TAA may differ from standard effects of unemployment insurance benefits by using workers laid off due to bankruptcy as a control group. Finally, the project assesses the costs and benefits of awarding TAA allowances, and also considers how regions with higher TAA “generosity” may vary in their support for trade measures with respect to lower generosity regions.
