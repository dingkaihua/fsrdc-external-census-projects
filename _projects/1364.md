abstract: "This project will develop a more complete understanding of the organizational characteristics and processes that predict the provision of employer‐sponsored health insurance plans and level of employer contribution to the insurance premium. The researchers will use data from the 1996‐2014 survey years of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS‐IC) combined with data from the Longitudinal Business Data, EEO‐1 reports from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, S&P’s Compustat, RiskMetrics, and Corporate Library datasets. This project will investigate two trends that potentially contribute to the decline in the percentage of U.S. workers covered by health insurance plans. The first is the rise of the new conception of employment, a shift in the employment contract between employers and employees that emphasizes market flexibility, short‐term commitments, and focuses on increasing shareholder value. The second is the decline in labor unions, decreasing the bargaining power of workers and potentially decreasing labor’s ability to argue that health insurance is a vital component of compensation."
