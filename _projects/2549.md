abstract: "How important are employment changes in a particular region-sector pair to the economic activity in other region-sector pairs? This project studies the effects of the well-documented manufacturing employment decline in the U.S. in the early 2000s. In particular, we focus on how the decline in a particular manufacturing sector affect both service sector employment and employment in other manufacturing sectors, both locally and in other regions. We aim to decompose these effects into establishment count adjustment (extensive margin), and the number of workers per establishment (intensive margin).  We additionally will seek to understand the effects of inter-regional trade and geographic characteristics of regions on these employment spillovers."
