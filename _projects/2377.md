abstract: "Floods trigger monumental losses across the US that are projected to increase with climate change. With the recent history of unprecedented flood losses from events including Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey, growing concern surrounds the detrimental consequences for some of the nation's most vulnerable communities. These distributional concerns are not new. Critically, little is known about how households may heterogeneously adjust to flood risk along several key housing margins including location choice and the decision to rent versus own, as well as how these decisions may be impacted by public welfare programs. The project will provide insight into these flooding issues through two empirical papers carefully motivated by theory. Both papers use data from the American Community Survey (2000-2023, as available).  Paper 1 applies a residential sorting model to data on recent movers in major metropolitan areas within the US to analyze the extent to which homebuyers and renters heterogeneously sort across flood risk based on their race/ethnicity, income, and educational attainment. These results will then be used to estimate the impacts of the National Flood Insurance Program and changes in flood risk on intra-US migration decisions and the resulting distribution of socioeconomic groups across flood risk in the US. Paper 2 examines how serious flood events affect migration decisions (e.g. whether, and where, to move within the US, and whether to rent versus buy) and mortgage impacts, and if participation in social insurance programs modifies the responses to flood-related natural disasters. These decisions can have long-term implications for risk exposure and wealth accumulation."
