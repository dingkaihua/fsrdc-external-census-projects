abstract: "The goal of this research is to study the determinants of productivity growth in construction. Using data from the Census of Construction, and from the new construction-related Producer Price Index developed at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we will develop new methods and better estimates of productivity for the construction sector. We will develop establishment-level measures of multifactor productivity and labor productivity, and we will investigate how a variety of factors, such as establishment size, industry, location, regulation, and the presence of undocumented immigrants, influence observed productivity. In addition, we examine some elements of productivity dynamics, examining what proportion of productivity growth occurs in existing establishments and the productivity performance of establishments that enter or exit.
