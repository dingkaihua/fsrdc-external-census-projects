abstract: "Corporate actions can affect firms' top managers, investors, consumers, and other firms in the same industry in various ways. However, there is little evidence of the effects of different types of corporate actions on international trade. In this project, we plan to use the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) to investigate whether different types of corporate actions affect companies' customer-supplier relationships, especially in the international market. Specifically, we will examine the impacts on prices, trade volumes, total exports/imports, the number of trading partners, and the number of destination countries."
