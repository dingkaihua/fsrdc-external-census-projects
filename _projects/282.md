abstract: "There has been a relative groundswell of empirical studies of business survival/turnover over the past decade.  However, most of these studies have one notable limitation--i.e., they are typically restricted to employer businesses.  The Center for Economic Studies (CES) has acquired microdata on tens of millions of nonemployer "firms."  I propose longitudinally linking as many of these records as possible over the years for which the nonemployer microdata are available.  I also plan to match these records to the Census Bureau's business register, as well as one of the Bureau's longitudinal business microdata files.  Upon completion of these matches, I intend to revisit empirical modeling of business dissolution (using hazard functions), to analyze the inter-temporal transition of business entities into and out of employer status, and to analyze patterns in receipts change (for surviving entities) over time.  Some of the other questions that I intend to address in this project include the following.  How many new employer firms were previously nonemployer firms?  What are the general patterns of transition of business entities between employer and nonemployer status?  How many firms with receipts below Census' cutoff (to be included in published nonemployer statistics) actually continue and grow to exceed that receipts threshold in subsequent years?  How do macro- and local economic conditions influence business formation and dissolution? "
