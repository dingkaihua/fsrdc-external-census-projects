abstract: "Gentrification is evident in a number of inner cities in the United States. Increasingly, families with young children are choosing city over suburban living. This study investigates the rise of dual-earner couples among high-income households as a driver of gentrification. This research hypothesizes that such families have high willingness-to-pay for a short commute (since there is no full-time homemaker) and therefore choose to locate close to work. Since skilled jobs are disproportionately located in city centers, the strive for a short commute results in gentrification of previously poverty stricken but centrally located areas. This project aggregates census tract-level information on household demographics from the Decennial Censuses and various years of the American Community Survey and matches to zip code-level real estate prices."
