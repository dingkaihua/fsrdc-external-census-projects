abstract: "The population of the United States has been shaped and reshaped by multiple waves of immigration. Yet data limitations have made it difficult to assess the ways and extent to which immigrants and their families have assimilated and become integrated into mainstream U.S. society.  Of key concern is understanding how assimilation patterns have differed across national origin groups, birth cohorts, and receiving contexts. This 5-year project builds on an ongoing Census Bureau data linkage project, the Core Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), which links individuals and families across decennial censuses, CPS and ACS survey data files from 1940 to the present. The current project will leverage the CLIP data to provide unique and new information about the adaptation and integration of immigrant populations over time and across three generations from 1940 to the present. In doing so, the research seeks to better understand the ways in which the assimilation process has varied across national origin groups and across different time periods and destination contexts. "
