abstract: "The minimum wage is a significant economic topic considering how many people and firms are impacted by the policy, and therefore is an important topic of study for economists. One type of minimum wage policy that has yet to be studied in depth are "dual minimum wage systems", which mandate higher minimum wages for larger firms. Dual minimum wage policies have been enacted in several states, including Illinois, New Jersey, and most recently California. In our proposed paper, we seek to answer the question "how do firms respond to dual minimum wage policies?" Specifically, we are interested in how firms change their labor supply in response to these policies by estimating the wage elasticity of labor using two types of bunching estimators. The first bunching estimator is taken from Kleven and Waseem (2013), where the number of excess firms utilizing labor below the kink is estimated by fitting a counterfactual wage schedule with a high order polynomial. From the number of bunching firms, as well as the increase in minimum wage pay at the kink, the wage elasticity supply of labor can be estimated. The second bunching estimator uses a differences-in-differences model to estimate the number of bunching firms at the kink, rather than estimating the counterfactual distribution with a polynomial. Specifically, we will use both these strategies to estimate the wage elasticity of labor in the manufacturing sector using ASM/CM and ABS data for years prior to 2023, and AIES data for the years 2023 and 2024. Though we hypothesize that firms will respond to "dual minimum wage policies" by reducing labor usage, labor frictions may prevent firms from doing so immediately or altogether. A benefit of our second estimation strategy is that we will also be able to observe how firms are changing their labor usage in response to these policies over time, further contributing to our understanding of how firms respond to "dual minimum wage systems." Though the focus of our paper is on estimating the wage elasticity of labor, it is likely that firms are also changing the usage of other inputs in response to "dual minimum wage policies" as well. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we plan to study how firms change their usage of these inputs in response to these policies. This later analysis will access input changes in response to dual minimum wage exposure in the manufacturing, service, and retail industries using ASM/CM and ABS datasets (respectively) for years prior to 2022, as well as the AIES for years 2023 and 2024. Finally, we evaluate the consistency of data collection as the Census moves from collecting firm data using multiple surveys (including the ASM, ARTS, and SAS) to the singular AIES. Using a difference in differences methodology, we will see if any of the key variables collected in these survey are changing from 2022 (the last year before switching to the AIES) to 2023 onward."
