abstract: "One of the most salient challenges in the study of desistance among justice-involved individuals (JII) is the limited ability to observe incarceration spells and account for mortality, in conjunction with one's criminal convictions. This proposed project aims to use Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) data linked with the Census Bureau Numident file and the Mortality Disparities in American Communities (MDAC) data to examine desistance patterns and mortality risks among different demographic groups taking into account exposure time in population-based samples."
