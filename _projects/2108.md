abstract: "This project studies the long-run consequences of disruptions in labor-market activity. Despite widespread interest in how workers respond to job disruptions such as shifts in labor demand and shocks to worker health, research has been limited by the challenge of linking workers' long-run outcomes to their exposure to these shocks. We request access to the restricted-use versions of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Basic Monthly panels and March Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS), linkable via PIK to the Supplemental Security Record (SSR), the 831-files, and extracts from the Master Earnings File and NUMIDENT from the Social Security Administration. This linkage will allow researchers to connect exposure to locally determined job disruptions to long-run outcomes of interest such as employment, earnings, and reliance on social insurance programs."
