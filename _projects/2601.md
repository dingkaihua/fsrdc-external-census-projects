abstract: "Studies suggest that clusters, or the geographic concentration of firms in the same or related industries, facilitate entrepreneurship. Less understood is why some startups founded in clusters relocate out of clusters, and how the timing and destination of relocation impacts economic success. This study combines external data on startup funding and founder characteristics with the Longitudinal Business Register, Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics, and Census data on commercial innovation to determine when and why startups relocate, how this impacts their workforce, and whether relocation affects startup performance. Results will shed light on previously unclear factors tied to the success or failure of startups, both at the company and worker-level, particularly in the tech industry."
