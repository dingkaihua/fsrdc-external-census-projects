abstract: "We propose to examine how factors such as cost of financing, supply of skilled human capital and market competition affect the innovative activity and performance at the firm level. We will use census datasets to track firmâ€™s growth over time and to construct measures of innovation activity, innovation outcome and firm performance. We will merge census datasets with external datasets to exploit variation in the funding provided to firms, exogenous shocks in the supply of highly-skilled workers available, and changes in competition environment through tariffs to gauge the effect of various market friction on innovation at the firm level."
