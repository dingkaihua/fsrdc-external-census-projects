abstract: "This project studies the prevalence of residential eviction in urban areas and the relationship between eviction and households' labor market and educational outcomes, residential mobility, program participation, and other socio-economic outcomes. The project will focus on the following questions: What are the socio-economic consequences of eviction? Which events tend to precede eviction? Which characteristics distinguish tenants facing eviction from the general population? And, which interventions and reforms can affect the prevalence of eviction? To answer these questions, the PI's will use a novel combination of rich longitudinal data and quasi-experimental research designs. At the core of the analysis are researcher-provided eviction court case histories, which will be linked to information on socio-economic outcomes for defendants in eviction court, their family members, and any non-family cohabitants. The datasets that will be linked include both Census-held datasets, and datasets brought in by the research team."
