abstract: "This research aims to identify the best custom definition of rural-urban classifications to use with attributes of tobacco-use and attitudes and determine the similarities or differences that exist across two rural populations (Appalachia and Delta) regarding factors that contribute to high prevalence of tobacco use. We combine information from Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS) and other Current Population Survey (CPS) supplements to assess the differential utility of several commonly used definitions and propose a new definition of the urban-rural continuum for explaining variation in tobacco-related outcomes. One end result of this project is a new, comprehensive custom urban-rural classification (isolation score measure) to assess rurality. Additionally, this research is designed to compare urban/rural TUS-CPS tobacco use behaviors in comparative models examining Appalachia, the Delta, and a region more typical of the United States, to further examine the nuances in rural America. The Appalachian and Delta regions were carefully selected as areas of interest because of their well-documented health disparities including smoking prevalence. "
