abstract: "Nicole Dalzell will carry out project-specific Ph.D. research supervised by RDC researcher Jerry Reiter and coordinated with Project PI Gale Boyd.  One goal of this work is to create either a linked file or programming code that will assist other researchers on ARTS-934 (CES project 1213) link internal Census Bureau data files to external datasets.  Dr. Reiter will supervise Nicole's research and not perform any active research on the project.  His addition to the project will allow him to see Nicole's work without it having to be requested for release, minimizing disclosure risk.  This research requires access to ASM, CMF, MECS, and SSEL data, as well as external datasets as described in the original ARTS-934 proposal.  Any record linkages between internal Census datasets or between internal and external data will occur as described in the project proposal at the establishment and/or firm level for businesses, or by geography for certain external datasets.  As described above, the main research task will be probabilistic record linkages between external datasets described in the project proposal, especially the IAC database, and the internal datasets listed.  All external data to be used during the course of this research are described in the original ARTS-934 proposal."
