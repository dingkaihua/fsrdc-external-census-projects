abstract: "This research seeks to comprehensively characterize how heterogeneity and idiosyncratic shocks at the firm and regional levels affect aggregate outcomes. Specifically, we are interested in describing how microeconomic forces shape aggregate outcomes through the dynamic behavior of firms. Recent contributions have shown that macroeconomic outcomes are disproportionately affected by specific categories of firms and/or regions. However, aggregate data masks this rich level of heterogeneity. Thus, we use microdata from the Economic Censuses, Longitudinal Business Database, Standard Statistical Establishment List, and Annual Survey of Manufactures to uncover the heterogeneity in aggregate outcomes at the firm and regional level, and to demonstrate its importance for the aggregate economy. In particular, we will document the extent of heterogeneity across plants and firms, and locations in the U.S. economy along several dimensions, including firm creation and growth, and produce several statistical estimates of the contribution of firm- and location-specific factors to the business cycle, labor market fluctuations, secular trends in market power, and business dynamism."
