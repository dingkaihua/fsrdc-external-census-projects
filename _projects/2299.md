abstract: "In the last few decades, globalization has advanced at an unprecedented pace and scope, and international trade has experienced tremendous growth. At the same time, nominal and real exchange rate volatilities are large. The sensitivity of international trade to US dollar currency changes and whether the financial market understands the sensitivity are important and still-unresolved questions. In this project, we use the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) --which contains detailed transaction-level data for all importing/exporting US firms--to assess, 1.  heterogeneity in trade prices, volumes, and revenues of US exporters and importers in response to exchange rate movements and 2. whether financial markets understand this sensitivity. 
Briefly speaking, we will use LFTTD to obtain export and import volume and unit value information for each transaction. We use import/export dates in the LFTTD to match transactions to exchange rate movements from the IMF Exchange Rates data, using a weighted average of the exchange rates firms experience. To recover firm-level characteristics, we link transactions to US firms in the Longitudinal Business Database (LDB) and via the Standard Statistical Establishment List/Business Register (SSEL) and the COMPUSTAT-SSEL Bridge (CSB) to the CRSP/COMPUSTAT merged database. We use data from the Penn World tables and IMF's International Financial Statistics to account for macroeconomic characteristics of US firms' foreign trading partners.  "
