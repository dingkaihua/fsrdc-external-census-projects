abstract: "While the aging of the labor force due to decline in fertility rates over the past few decades and the accompanying decline in labor market fluidity in the United States has drawn research attention recently, their influence on firms is little known. In this research, we investigate how firms respond to the shifting labor force age structure and the evolving labor market fluidity by focusing on three aspects: firm entry and exit rates, decisions affecting productivity (such as R&D activities, physical capital investment, and hiring of skilled labor), and realized productivity (mainly residual TFP). To this end, we link together data from the Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), Census of Manufactures, and Annual Survey on Manufactures at the firm and establishment levels.
