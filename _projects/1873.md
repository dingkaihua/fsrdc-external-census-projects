abstract: "This research investigates the welfare implications of corporate actions by examining the effects of leverage, mergers, and acquisition on other nearby firms and local labor markets. In addition to leveraging well-established estimates of local commuting zones to assess spillover effects of these actions, we use data from Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics and the Longitudinal Business Database to compute granular overlapping zones and a new measure of local labor and firm competition that we call Regions of Spatial Competition, which should be more accurate for areas on the borders of existing commuting zones. We then compare the mobility and wages of workers in these markets who do and do not experience corporate shocks. If differences are found, results suggest that existing corporate finance theories focusing on privately optimal frameworks fail to capture ways that spillover impacts local markets more widely. "
