abstract: "For urban planners and designers, New Urbanism has been a principle approach in promoting a sense of community and walkability. The principles of New Urbanism primarily deal with urban form and design aspects; however, what is typically lacking are social aspects in urban communities. A notable and arguable aspect of New Urbanism is the assumption of economic stability and population growth. In recent years, the assumption that cities must inevitably grow has been criticized as many cities rather experienced urban decline. How New Urbanist communities mitigate or respond to neighborhood abandonment and physical disorders is still understudied. 

To fill the gap in the New Urbanism literature, our project uses the American Housing Survey and the American Community Survey from 2009-2018 to investigate four sub-studies examining the relationship between the New Urbanist environment and neighborhood abandonment. Study 1 examines if communities with New Urbanist features are more resilient to abandonment than are other communities. Study 2 examines if New Urbanist features can mitigate or predict neighborhood disorders. Study 3 compares the effects of the New Urbanist environment on neighborhood abandonment across growing, shrinking, and stable metro areas. Study 4 examines the role of the New Urbanist features in the relationship between neighborhood change and abandonment at the neighborhood level."
