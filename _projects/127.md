abstract: "Although the United States has a relatively high level of entrepreneurial activity in comparison to other major industrialized countries (see Reynolds, Hay, and Camp, 1999), there is substantial geographic and sector diversity in entrepreneurial activity within the U.S. This proposal specifies a method of measuring this geographical diversity in entrepreneurial activity, and identifying important regional characteristics associated with differences in various types of entrepreneurial activity.  This analysis, and the regional data constructed for it, will serve as a starting point for a more extensive research project focused on the diversity in business entry rates."
