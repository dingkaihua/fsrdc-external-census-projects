abstract: "This project will study firm dynamics in the agricultural services sector. The research will determine the rate of establishment entry and exit, the size distribution of entrants and exiters, the age distribution of exiters, and the distribution of wages paid to workers in this sector. Because the agricultural sector of the U.S. economy has been subject to significant structural changes in the past three decades, the project will also consider whether establishment dynamics in the agricultural services sector have been changing systematically over time. This research will also examine changes in the structure of in the agricultural services sector and compare whether establishment dynamics differ between single- and multi-establishment firms."
