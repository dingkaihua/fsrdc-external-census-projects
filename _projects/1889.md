abstract: "When evaluating mergers and acquisitions (M&A), the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission focus entirely on consumer welfare. Efficiency gains through consolidation help consumers by decreasing prices, but anti-competitive behavior in the product market hurts consumers by increasing prices. While generally ignored, the same efficiency and competition concerns are relevant for labor markets. If M&A increases efficiency, wages may rise if the gains from efficiency are shared with workers. If M&A increases consolidation in the labor market, wages may fall due to decreased bargaining power for workers. This research uses data from the Longitudinal-Employer Household Dynamics program combined with a dataset of M&A from Thomson Reuters to document the impact of M&A on workers. In particular, we will document how the effect of M&A on wages differs by the level of concentration in the labor market in order to disentangle anti-competitive effects from efficiency effects. "
