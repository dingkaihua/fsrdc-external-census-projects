abstract: "This project assesses the labor market returns to double majoring in college compared to single majoring. This is an especially important question as double majoring has become an increasingly common phenomenon in the US over the past few decades. To do so, we use data from the National Survey of College Graduates to compare the earnings of students who double major with earnings of peers who graduated from the same institution and who are observationally similar but single major instead. To address concerns that students sort into major type (double versus single) along unobserved characteristics that may affect labor market outcomes, we use a partial identification method to obtain bounded estimates for the causal effect of double majoring, which accounts for the role of selection on unobserved characteristics. We hypothesize that double majoring will lead to slightly higher earnings by providing students with a broader skillset that provides them with more options in the labor market."
