abstract: "We aim to investigate an explanation for a well-established, but hitherto unexplained, empirical regularity in the tax literature: that progressive income taxation fails to meaningfully impact income inequality.  We will investigate whether an additional unexpected empirical finding, that firms do not fully exercise their labor market monopsony power, can provide an explanation by enabling firms to adjust their within-firm wage distributions to counteract the intended equity effects of progressive taxation.  To answer this question, we propose a model where a measure of real pre-tax within-firm income inequality (constructed using the LEHD's EHF) is regressed on an interaction term constituted of instrumented measures of within-firm income-tax progressivity (constructed using the LEHD's EHF and researcher-provided tax data) and firm-level labor market monopsony power (constructed using the LEHD's EHF, and establishment-level QWI).  The coefficient on this interaction term will tell us what portion of a change in a firm's income distribution can be attributed to changes in the exercise of monopsony power that are induced by changes in income taxes.  We expect this coefficient to show evidence of widening pre-tax inequality in response to an increase in progressivity.  We then also propose running additional models to investigate the impact of this estimated change on the annual earnings growth of certain demographic groups (defined using information in the LEHD's ICF).  These additional regressions will tell us what groups of workers are most likely to be adversely affected by the unintended consequences of progressive taxation that we estimate in the main regressions."
