abstract: "The modern economy is characterized by a complex network of customer and supplier relationships.  Idiosyncratic shocks affecting one firm are known to propagate upstream and downstream over supply chains. Direct and indirect customers of firms hit by idiosyncratic shocks, such as natural disasters, experience significant declines in sales growth and profitability. However, while the existing literature documents the risk of propagation, little is known on how firms react when negative shocks affect their customers and suppliers. The purpose of this project to conduct a micro-level analysis that documents how shocks that disrupt supply chains affect customers' investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions. The project will conduct this analysis in two parts that complement each other: First, we conduct an "ex post" analysis by examining how realized disruptions of suppliers' production affect customers' investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions as well as their productivity.  Second, we complement the "ex post" analysis in the first part with an "ex ante" analysis. We construct a new measure of supply chain risk faced by firms and analyze what firms do to manage the risk that suppliers will not be able to deliver the inputs required from them. The Census of Manufacturers and Annual Survey of Manufacturers, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, the Quarterly Financial Report Census Years, the Commodity  Flow Survey, the Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders, the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization, the Survey of Industrial Research and Development, the Business Research & Development and Innovation Survey, and the Census of Auxiliary Establishments and Standard Statistical Establishment List will be used to quantify the effect of supply chain risks on firm behavior and performance."
