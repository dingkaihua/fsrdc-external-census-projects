abstract: "There is great concern among educators, policymakers, and laypersons about the perceived decline in primary and secondary school teacher quality over the past 40 years. Though this issue has spawned substantial academic and policy research on the relationship between student outcomes and observable measures of teacher quality (such as educational attainment, experience, and SAT scores), the results of such studies remain far from convincing. This project investigates the hypotheses that: 1) pay is more compressed in teaching than in other, comparable occupations; 2) as a result, high quality teachers leave teaching at higher rates than low quality teachers; and 3) this has a measurable effect on student outcomes. The Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, with its matched employer-employee wage data, is uniquely suited to this empirical investigation. The project will identify high quality teachers by their relative wages and the wage dispersion at their jobs after leaving a particular school district; this avoids many of the frequent criticisms found in the teacher quality literature. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) provides information on compensation and unionization policies in public schools in the states listed above; linked to the LEHD data this can establish the relationship between specific policies and wage compression. The Common Core of Data (CCD) provides basic information and descriptive statistics on all schools, their students, and their teachers; this information, linked to the LEHD, will provide many controls in the analysis and allow an investigation of student outcomes."
