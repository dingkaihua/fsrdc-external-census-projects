abstract: "We use the Longitudinal Business Database to evaluate the effect of local labor demand shocks on economic outcomes in neighborhoods surrounding the affected locations. This research uses a series of highly localized exogenous variations in labor demand to examine its impact on local economic outcomes such as firm entries and exits, employment, local wages, rents, etc. We examine how such effects differ by the characteristics of the locations in which the labor demand shocks take place. This study provides insights on how local jobs are created, how an initial labor demand shock would propagate through local economies through the “multiplier effects”, and how the propagation process depends on the types of neighborhoods in which it takes place. By estimating the cross-industry local multiplier effects, this research also helps in understanding the nature of local production agglomeration. In addition, by estimating the effect of labor demand shocks on entries of local service firms and rents, the research also sheds light on the mechanism of local consumption agglomeration. "
