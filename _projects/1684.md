abstract: "This research investigates the adverse effects of import competition on exposed workers, firms, and local labor markets, both on firms that compete directly with foreign producers, as well as through several indirect channels whose relative importance is not yet known. This project poses three questions. First, what are the predominant mechanisms through which trade shocks impact aggregate employment and output? Alongside direct effects, we evaluate two leading explanations for trade-induced job losses: aggregate demand effects and propagation through input-output linkages. Second, how do trade shocks affect the allocation of economic activity across firms? Theoretical models of firm-level dynamics suggest that the effects of both direct and indirect import exposure on entry, exit, and factor demands should vary systematically with a firmâ€™s initial productivity, exporting status, size, and age. These heterogeneous treatment effects, if present, could give rise to economically important reallocation in response to trade shocks. Finally, what are the effects of negative shocks, such as import exposure, on firm and establishment survey non-response in Census Bureau surveys and censuses?"
