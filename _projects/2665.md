abstract: "Over the last two decades, same-sex couples in the U.S. have become increasingly represented in neighborhoods outside of what were once "distinct gay ghettos" like the Castro district of San Francisco or Midtown Atlanta (hereafter referred to as "LGBT neighborhoods"). One prominent explanation for the spatial deconcentration of same-sex couples focuses on the displacement of same-sex couples from gentrifying LGBT neighborhoods. However, large-scale evidence of gentrification's effect on same-sex couples has been limited. This study seeks to fill that gap by utilizing 2005-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) microdata combined with neighborhood-level Decennial Census data to provide a detailed assessment of residential outcomes among same-sex couples at the national level. In this study, I will describe mobility patterns of same-sex couples compared to different-sex couples, assessing differences in the incomes of in- and out- movers to and from LGBT and integrated neighborhoods. I will also assess differences in the average incomes of origin and destination neighborhoods for same-sex couple movers compared to different-sex couple movers. Finally, I will estimate probabilities of exiting and entering neighborhoods of different types (LGBT or integrated) for same-sex couple movers. Through these analyses, this project will uncover trends in the geographic dispersal of same-sex couples and contribute to discussions of gentrification's effect on same-sex couples."
