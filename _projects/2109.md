abstract: "Income inequality has increased substantially in the United States over the last 30 years (see Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 for a survey). However, whether the dispersion of earnings growth - what is known as income volatility or instability - has also increased and what the nature of this instability is remains the subject of considerable debate. Following the seminal work of Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), several researchers have found that income instability has increased over the past two decades. Recent work using administrative data, however, indicates a declining trend or no trend at all (e.g. Sabelhaus and Song, 2010). Moreover, most of the existing research focuses on worker characteristics, even though firm characteristics and the extent to which workers transition across different employment states and different employers could be equally, if not more important, to explain the evolution the extent and evolution of income instability.
This project proposes to combine employer-employee linked data from the Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics (LEHD) program with other administrative and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as external data to inform the Census Bureau about the evolution and nature of income inequality and income instability. Precise estimation on the evolution of the dispersion of the growth rates of labor income, a measure of income instability, is crucial to measure the degree of uncertainty or risks that workers face, informs our understanding of the evolution of income inequality, and has important economic and policy implications (see Low et al., 2010; Guvenen and Smith, 2014; and the references therein)."
