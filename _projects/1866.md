abstract: "In network-centric research, population is represented by large, aggregated census geographies to reduce computational complexity and accommodate data availability. However, it is well known in the literature that as spatial data are aggregated and precise locational information is lost, error occurs. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel method, PolyPop2Net or PP2N (Population Polygons to Networks), for allocating populations to networks by utilizing restricted-use 2010 Decennial Census microdata and the restricted-use Master Address File Extract as the benchmark truth. We will use publicly available 2010 decennial data to run Operations Research and Network Analysis models to evaluate the accuracy and validity of the PP2N. Specifically, we test the PP2N method using nested Census Bureau geographies from the publicly available 2010 Decennial Census for Leon County, Florida. We use the simulated examples along with the true Leon County examples to determine the generalizability of the new method. The new method will then be shared with others and will be available for use through integration into a spatial analysis package in Python."
