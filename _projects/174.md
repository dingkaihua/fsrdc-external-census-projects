abstract: "This project will construct new measures of firm-level risk and use these measures in description and estimation .  Our risk measures will capture (1) volatility of output in manufacturing plants, (2) diversifiability of risk in manufacturing branches of firms, and (3) the correlation between industry and firm output volatility.  Besides descriptive uses of the data, the project will explore implications of firm-level risk for investment, and interactive effects between volatility and research and development (R&D) activity in the investment decision."
