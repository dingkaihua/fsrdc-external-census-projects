abstract: "The proportion of single mothers in poverty not receiving public assistance or participating in the formal employment sector has approximately doubled over the past decade.  Recent research indicates that personal barriers are common and likely hinder entry into the workforce and navigation of welfare bureaucracies. The proposed project will examine the ecological circumstances of disconnected single mothers with a focus on the influence of welfare rules and community circumstances on the likelihood of being disconnected."
