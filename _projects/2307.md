abstract: "Social science research is intently focused on describing the characteristics of the increasingly diverse foreign-born population with respect to migrant status, and, if and how integration outcomes vary across status groups. However, empirical studies of immigrant integration have been hampered by a lack of nationally representative survey data of the foreign-born. The research proposed here - specifically focused on health outcomes- aims to address this data and methodological shortcoming and provide avenues for future empirical research on immigrant integration in America. To overcome data limitations, this project first makes three methodological advances by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from the US Census matched to federal administrative records. First, we will estimate the prevalence of measurement error of the foreign-born population in the SIPP by using the existence (or lack) of an administrative record match. Second, we will articulate a method for adjusting sample weights for coverage error in the SIPP that disproportionately impacts estimates of the foreign-born population. Third, we will test methods for using SIPP data in combination with other national surveys in order to impute characteristics of immigrants measured only in the SIPP in much larger surveys that lack such characteristics. The resulting methodological advances and data will be used to examine how health outcomes that are commonly used as indicators of immigrant integration (self-rated health (SRH), number of sick days during the previous 12 months, work disabling illnesses, indicators of psychological distress, health insurance coverage, and routine care) vary by migrant status. Together, the results will present vital methodological and substantive contributions to the growing migrant status literature in the social sciences and health fields. Ultimately, the purpose of this research is to provide a methodological foundation to support empirically-validated, important social and public policy analyses focused on migrant status as well as immigrant integration processes and wellbeing."
