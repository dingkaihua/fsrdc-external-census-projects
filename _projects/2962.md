abstract: "Participation in the financial mainstream is necessary for integration in economic and financial systems, however, the unbanked rates for Latin American immigrants in the US has been historically low. This has implications for first and second generation immigrants as financial mobility is limited. This study aims to assess the levels of financial participation for immigrants, as well as intergenerational financial mobility. To assess the level of financial participation, we will estimate banking rates, access to credit and total number of investments. We will consider the extent to which Latin Americans own and use financial products and services, in comparison to US native born, and study the evolution of these financial inclusion gaps over time. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we will observe both the household and individual level for the years 1990-2020. In addition, we will compare our estimates with results based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), for a larger representation of financial participation. We will employ time and state fixed effects, to determine point estimates as we determine gaps between foreign-born Hispanics and US-born. The literature does not provide a recent consistent time series for Latin American immigrants, therefore this gap in the literature will be filled by presenting a historical time series of unbanked rates across Hispanic origin from the early 1990s to 2020 using Census provided data."
