abstract: "This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau as it generates population estimates during the  process of: (1) improving the linkage methodology for two types of Census Bureau-collected surveys; (2) linking currently unlinked data from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) to the Census Bureau's internal business data, providing new information on foreign-born scientists and engineers; and (3) comparing two parallel linking processes for matching the NSCG data to the Census Bureau's business data and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program data.
The researchers will use both direct and probabilistic entity resolution (i.e., record linkage) to match employer information in the NSCG to U.S. Census Bureau employer records, using data from the LEHD and County Business Patterns Business Register (CBPBR) for employer matching. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) will be used to assist with the matching effort, especially in terms of tracking establishments and firms over time. Links between the NSCG and LBD/CBPBR will be performed probabilistically based on employer information reported in the NSCG. Links between the NSCG and LEHD data will be made directly at the employee-level using Protected Identification Key (PIK) information available in both data sources. For cases where a PIK match can be made,  the accuracy of these "employee" matches can be straightforwardly compared at employer-level since both linking processes can be employed side-by-side. Correspondingly, one Census benefit of the project will be the comparison of the accuracy for the two methods as well as verification of one process (when possible) through use of the other. The end result will ultimately enable data-driven analysis of foreign-born scientist and engineer (FBSE) employment in the context of immigration status, degree fields, and industry sectors, improving the analytic utility of the NSCG data for future users. Moreover, the Census Bureau's LEHD and LBD data, as well as other business data that can be linked to the LBD, will be enhanced going forward through the ability to link those data sources to the NSCG. The researchers will provide the Bureau with a technical memorandum summarizing the results of the linking process, and comparisons made during that process, to summarize the benefits provided.
The effort will link databases utilizing the approach of d-blink, which proposes a scalable unsupervised joint approach for blocking and entity resolution. This approach will handle missing information and will be more accurate in situations where firm ownership, names or addresses change over time. The d-blink approach can also simultaneously merge more than two databases, is based on Bayesian methods and is less sensitive to the choice of matching threshold and will provide uncertainty quantification from the entity resolution process. In contrast to existing methods for canonicalization, our proposed approach does not rely on training data and can handle categorical, ordinal, and numerical attributes. By performing each stage--entity resolution, canonicalization, and downstream task--in a Bayesian framework, uncertainty is propagated throughout and properly accounted for when reaching final conclusions. This statistical solution will enable data-driven analysis of foreign-born scientist and engineer (FBSE) employment in the context of their immigration status, degree fields, and the industry sectors in which they are employed. The research will ultimately improve the analytic utility of the NSCG data for Census Bureau stakeholders, both internal and external."
