abstract: "This project will estimate plant-level total factor productivity (TFP) for manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the period 1976 to 2005, and will use these estimates to calculate aggregate or average TFP by state, MSA, and county. The project will examine how spatial divergence across states and counties has changed over the sample period. This analysis is prompted by findings that investments in information and communications technology are complementary with the existing base of human capital and skills in a given location. Given that U.S. cities are increasingly divergent in their stocks of human capital, the research tests whether productivity in manufacturing has also become more geographically disparate. A second objective is to test whether local area productivity is related to earnings and employment outcomes at the individual level and to individuals' attitudes towards trade liberalization and government spending. This component is motivated by a literature on the consequences of productivity for workers, relating productivity to wages and risk of job loss. Using the data on average TFP by state, county, and MSA from the first part of this project, the second component tests the effect of aggregate TFP in manufacturing in the local area on earnings and employment using data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey. Finally, and given the links drawn between risks to employment and earnings and individual attitudes towards trade liberalization and government spending, the research tests whether aggregate TFP in the local area correlates with these individual attitudes. The latter section of the research employs public-use data from the American National Election Study."
