abstract: " 
Has devolution of welfare policy based on the 1996 welfare reform act created “welfare magnet” states where state policies provide more generous benefits and lenient participation requirements? Have welfare disincentive states with more restrictive policies resulted in increased intrastate adjustment moves and outmigration of welfare poor families? Does welfare-driven migration result in increased after-move wellbeing compared with before the move for welfare poor families versus nonmigrant families? This study uses merged data from four sources—the 1996 and 2001 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Urban Institute’s Welfare Rules Database, and a local labor market characteristics file created from decennial census and Current Population Survey data—in a longitudinal, two-stage specification of welfare-benefit “push” and “pull” impacts on poor families’ migration behavior. Based upon a state welfare policy inequality framework, we use factor analysis to develop measures from textual policy manual materials to operationalize 10 welfare benefit and eligibility rule dimensions for the post-1996 welfare reform implementation period and use these measures to test hypothesized state program effects on migration. We use discrete-time event history analysis to predict migration events (interstate or intrastate migration) in the SIPP data. Our hierarchical modeling strategy considers an integrated, and previously untested, micro-macro analysis of three determinant-of-migration hypotheses for welfare poor families. These tests evaluate effects of 1) time-varying state welfare policy characteristics; 2) individual and family characteristics, including detailed migration, work, and welfare participation histories and network ties, from the information-rich SIPP files; and 3) local labor market-level economic opportunity structure indicators. Following Frey et al. (1996), we separately analyze push and pull migration effects of our hypothesized covariates through, first, a “destination model” for identifying pull effects and then, a “departure model,” which identifies push effects for potential migrants’ origin locations. The combination of destination and departure model vectors for state welfare policy, local labor market, and individual and household indicators will provide a strong test, giving new evidence on the “salience of benefit variation to subjects” thesis (Shram and Voss 1999) regarding the welfare policy impact on migration. Finally, we model post-move family income, welfare benefits, and participation requirements as well-being outcomes of welfare poor migrants versus nonmigrants using time-ordered additive and interactive OLS regression models. The proposed work is expected 1) to provide estimates of migration among the welfare poor; 2) to improve understanding the quality of data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau through efforts to understand migration-related reasons for loss to sample; 3) to result in enhancement of the data collected by the Census Bureau by addition of state-level policy data and local labor market indicators for the 1996 through 2002 period, providing for the development of links across both time and entities for these data; and 4) to demonstrate to the demographic community the value of the SIPP for studying migration and other migration-related phenomena, since the Census Bureau has undertaken efforts with the most recent data collections to improve its quality for this purpose."
