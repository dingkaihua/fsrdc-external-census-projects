abstract: "This paper studies the effect of U.S. Housing Choice Voucher Program Section 8 on low income people's labor supply, family formation and homeownership. I analyze this issue using data from 2014 Panel and 2018 Panel of the restricted-use Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). My economic approach is to use the policy assigning housing vouchers based on an income cutoff as an instrument to study the effect of housing vouchers on low-income people's employment, family formation and homeownership. The assignment policy states that households with income lower than 50% of the median income for the MSA/county area are eligible for housing vouchers. In order to infer the household eligibility status, I need the household MSA/county code, which is accessible through the SIPP restricted-use data. With household eligibility status, I compare the households whose incomes are slightly below the income cutoff (eligible households) with households whose incomes are slightly above the income cutoff (ineligible households) to identify the effect of housing vouchers on employment, family formation and homeownership. This project will contribute to understanding the effect of Section 8 Housing Voucher on low-income households' labor supply, family formation and homeownership decisions as well as the welfare implication of such housing assistance programs on low income households.
