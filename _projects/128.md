abstract: "This project will identify the effect of information technology on the location of economic activity. Advances in information technology have the potential to affect firms   location in many ways: with new technologies, a firm might find that it no longer needs to be in cities, or it might no longer need to be near rural clients; a firm might decide to disperse its operations over several distant sites, or it might decide to consolidate in one location. The goal of this research is to determine what kind of places   the central cities of large metropolitan areas, suburbs of large metropolitan areas, smaller metropolitan areas, small towns, or rural areas, for instance   are benefiting from firms   adoption of information technology. 
By linking county-level data on changes in firm location with industry-level data on information technology usage, this research will distinguish which of the popular notions about technology and cities is accurate. The methodology for this study consists of local industry growth regressions. The dependent variable is the employment change over time in local industry (that is, an industry-county cell). The independent variable of interest is the interaction between information technology usage and location characteristics, like metropolitan area size and county density. The coefficients on these interaction terms will identify whether information technology favors employment shifts to big cities, smaller cities, suburbs, or rural areas. 
The success of this research depends on the quality of the firm location data. The most appropriate firm location data for this study is the Longitudinal Enterprise and Establishment Microdata (LEEM) file. The LEEM file has the advantages of tracking individual establishments over time; of identifying the firm that an establishment belongs to; of providing exact employment counts instead of estimates; and of covering all sectors including services, which is the sector most likely to be affected by advances in information technology.
