abstract: "Ever since the 1980's, consultants, experts, and trade press have consistently advised managers to pursue a lean strategy and to lower inventories regardless of industry, product or geographic differences. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that efforts to reduce inventories do not always lead to improved firm performance. It is conceivable that the relationship between inventories and firm performance is moderated by the environment in which a firm operates. The research question addressed in this proposal is to identify the environmental conditions that shape the inventory-performance relationship.

The project will estimate the effect of production environmental characteristics, operationalized through the Organizational Task Environment (OTE), on the relationship of inventory management and firm performance. The effect of inventory leanness is measured by regressing firm performance, measured as profitability or productivity, on an Empirical Leanness Indicator (ELI) estimated using turnover curves. The ELI is defined by the difference in a given firm's inventory as compared to the firm-size adjusted average inventory level for its industry. 

The moderating variables are environmental characteristics which are operationalized through the Organizational Task Environment (OTE). OTE is operationalized along three dimensions, namely munificence, dynamism and complexity. Munificence reflects the abundance or scarcity of production resources and capacity, generally estimated using sales growth. Dynamism refers to environmental volatility and comprises facets of instability and unpredictability, and will be measured by sales volatility over time. Complexity describes the difficulty to understand and manage a firm's environment, and will be proxied by measures of R&D intensity, information technology intensity, and management practices such as decentralization and data driven decision making. Numerous studies have found evidence of the moderating effects of environmental dynamism, complexity and munificence on the strategy-performance relationship of firms within their supply chains. Hence, the central tenet of this research project is that these OTE characteristics define the extent to which inventory leanness is associated with performance improvements in a given industry environment."
