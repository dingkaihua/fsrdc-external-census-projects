abstract: "The economic justification for local industrial strategies relies critically on the size and nonlinearity of agglomeration externalities as well as multiple equilibria. This project uses confidential Census micro data to test the economic justification for local industrial programs by examining the effect of “winning” the competition for a new large plant on incumbent plant productivity, testing for nonlinearity of the agglomeration function, and testing for evidence of multiple equilibria in county manufacturing shares. The first objective will be accomplished by the use of multiple sets of large plant openings to test spillover estimates for sensitivity to identification strategy. The project will investigate the sensitivity of productivity estimates to changes in the definition of output as well as sensitivity to inclusion of purchased services and to plant sample selection. The researchers will also assess aggregate efficacy by nonparametric estimation of the effect of local plant density on plant output in a partially linear regression model. Finally, the researchers will test whether the “winning” counties’ share of manufacturing and manufacturing industry output is best characterized by a single steady state spatial distribution, whereby counties’ return to their “pre-shock” levels, or multiple equilibria, whereby the shock permanently moves the distribution from its initial steady state to a new one. The proposed multiple equilibria analysis will be the first to use microdata, consider positive shocks to local industrial structure, and to do so within the United States."
