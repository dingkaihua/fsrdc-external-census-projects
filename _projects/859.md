abstract: "This project analyzes food manufacturing firms’ adjustment to globalization by investigating the linkages among productivity, exports and imports, and the role of mergers and acquisitions on firms’ decisions to conduct arm’s length transactions as opposed to intra-firm trade. This project will shed light on the impact of trade in the following areas of the food manufacturing industry: (1) changes in product mix and product proliferation as well as changes in employment due to import competition and trade reforms; (2) the relationship between mergers and acquisitions and firms’ decisions to engage in arm’s length vs. intra-firm trade; (3) productivity differences between firms engaged in trade relative to those that are not; (4) innovation and product differentiation as engines for growth which promote competitiveness (measured as returns to factors of production). For the productivity estimation, this project applies a methodology to adjust the measurement of productivity by taking into consideration both simultaneity and omitted price variable biases. The industries where firms have differentiated products, as in the food manufacturing industry, have biased coefficient estimates using the general approach."
