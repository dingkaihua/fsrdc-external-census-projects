abstract: "In this project, we plan to analyze the extent to which wages of workers that graduate in different majors grow at different speed over the workers' life. Using regression analysis controlling for individual fixed effects and the large longitudinal dataset obtained merging the ACS to the LEHD, we plan to estimate college major specific wage growth profiles.

In this project, we also plan to study the mechanisms underneath this heterogeneity. Utilizing the matched employee-employer nature of the LEHD and a double fixed effect specification as in Bonhomme et al (2020), we plan to analyze to what extent the observed patterns are driven by different assortative matching at the beginning of the workers' careers. For example, a slower wage growth profile for STEM workers, as previously estimated by Deming and Noray (2020), could be generated by the fact that these workers enter in the labor force better matched than workers with different degrees. 

Our analysis will also include other potential explanations, such as different industrial matching, i.e. the matching between an industry and the skills of the workers, and a discussion on the role of geographical sorting, estimating to which extent these patterns are generated by the fact that labor markets of different sizes employ workers from different majors. We finally plan to estimate whether workers of different degrees are able to absorb or learn skills from their coworkers with different intensities using a framework similar to Jarosh et al. (2021)."
