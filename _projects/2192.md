abstract: "This project uses 2008-2017 American Community Survey data to examine the impact of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), the largest health reform in a generation, on low-income individuals. The project focuses on three questions of interest: (1) how ACA Medicaid expansions affected health insurance coverage, (2) how ACA Medicaid expansions affected participation in other non-health safety net programs, and (3) how ACA Medicaid expansions affected employment and wages.  We use a county-border-pair design to assess how individuals living in states with ACA Medicaid eligibility expansions compare to those living just on the other side of a state border without such expansions."
