abstract: "This project aims to fill gaps in knowledge about Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) by producing estimates of trends in the MSP participation rate, characteristics of the population eligible for and enrolled in MSPs, including information about out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, and examining the effect of a key policy change that aimed to increase MSP participation. We require non-public Census Bureau data to complete this project including the 2006-2017 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), 2006-2017 Medicare Enrollment DataBase (EDB), and 2006-2017 Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data. The SIPP data contain a large sample with accurate information on income, assets, marital status, and state of residence needed to simulate most criteria to identify the MSP-eligible population. The Medicare EDB and Medicaid MSIS data are needed to link to the SIPP to enable estimation of the final MSP-eligible population based on eligibility for Medicare Part A and to identify the MSP-enrolled population. Without the ability to link the non-public SIPP, EDB, and MSIS data sources, we would be unable to identify who is enrolled in MSPs to address any of the research questions of interest."
