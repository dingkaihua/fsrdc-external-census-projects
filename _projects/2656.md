abstract: "While substantial literatures have examined the consequences of gender and ethnic diversity within organizations, little is known about how business owners may predict diversity outcomes, as well as their effects at the organizational level.  In this study, I examine how diversity at the business owner level may be related to employee diversity, and how their interaction may predict organizational performance outcomes. Using data from O*NET, I also examine how job characteristics (e.g., skill requirements, tasks) may moderate the relationship between differences in business owner/employee race/gender and employee departures. Collectively, these analyses will provide insight into the mechanisms through which diversity is shaped and the extent to which organizational diversity affects measures of firm productivity. The primary datasets used for analysis are the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), American Community Survey (ACS), Survey of Business Owners (SBO), and Annual Business Survey (ABS)."
