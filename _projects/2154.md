abstract: "The goal of this project is to study the effect of financial reporting regulation on firm dynamics based on different prior state-level disclosure-requirement conditions. To demonstrate firm dynamics, I first show within-firm efficiency and then examine across-firm efficiency and resource allocation. To show within-firm efficiency, I study firm-specific TFP and geographic mobility. For across-firm efficiency and resource allocation (i.e., shifting the allocation of labor and capital). I study whether resources move towards firms with higher productivity within local industries, whether there are disproportionate effects on smaller and younger businesses, and whether there are resource allocation dynamics between public and private establishments (e.g., standard general equilibrium effects).

Empirically analyzing the research question has been difficult because of both data and identification challenges. The analyses of ex ante regulatory design require state-level disclosure jurisdictions. To construct this measurement, I use machine learning techniques to dissect judicial opinions at state-level cases to document how rigorous and specific disclosure requirements are within the state. The analyses of ex post firm dynamics require micro-level data on small firms connecting both their real decisions to their productivity and age."
