abstract: "Our objective is to estimate mortality rates over time within states and identify and estimate the contribution of modifiable risk factors for mortality within the US population as a whole and within population subgroups. To achieve this, we will utilize multi-year cohort data, specifically the American Community Survey (ACS) linked to Census Numident mortality follow-up data, the Mortality Disparities in American Communities (MDAC), and the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) - each dataset has a unique combination of mortality data, risk factors, follow-up time, and sample size. The datasets will be discretized by mortality follow-up, with each year having a multi-cohort sample and corresponding survey weight adjustment. Weighted discrete time-to-event Poisson regression within an age-period-cohort analysis framework will be used to estimate yearly mortality rates.
We will explore the contribution of risk factors to the change in mortality rates over time and between birth cohorts. The large sample size of the ACS will enable us to examine more granular population subgroups, while still avoiding disclosure risk. This research will contribute to understanding mortality predictors and inform future interventions related to health and mortality across the US."
