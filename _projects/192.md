abstract: "This project studies the residential and labor force positions of ethnic and racial groups in 1990.  This was a period of intense immigration and also secondary migration to new parts of the country.  The purpose is to assess the degree to which these groups experienced a process of assimilation into the mainstream or, alternatively, created or were confronted by enduring group boundaries.   "
