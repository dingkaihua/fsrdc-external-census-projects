abstract: "This project examines whether broad-based equity-based incentives are eﬀective at aligning incentives and the potential costs associated with providing these incentives. If employee ownership provides appropriate incentives, worker productivity should be higher and employee turnover should be lower. However, employee ownership also gives employees voting rights, which can be used to extract employee beneﬁts at the expense of other stakeholders in the ﬁrm. For example, workers with voting rights may be more successful at obtaining above-market wages or in delaying or preventing layoﬀ s or plant closures. Examining the eﬀects of employee ownership on ﬁrm and establishment performance measures—such as productivity and wages—which in turn aﬀect ﬁrm value, will provide important insights into the beneﬁts and limitations of equity-based compensation."
