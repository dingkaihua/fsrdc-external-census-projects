abstract: "The extent to which environmental, energy, and other types of regulations influence firm-level production decisions has important implications for aggregate welfare and distributional incidence. Empirical research in this area is limited though growing. Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods still compares how "clean" versus "dirty" industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, the availability of firm and plant-level data makes it possible to recognize that firms within an industry differ very widely. Even within a narrowly defined industry firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces. The lack of high-quality, firm or plant level microdata has substantially limited research in this area. "
