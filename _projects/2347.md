abstract: "Over the past several decades, there has been a well-documented change in the cyclical nature of the U.S. economy. Since the 1980s, the volatility of business cycle aggregates, such as GDP, unemployment and inflation, and microeconomic aggregates, such individual labor earnings, fell substantially. A second well-documented trend in the economy over the same period has been the secular fall in the labor share and the rise of superstar firms. Between 1987 and 2007, the US labor share, which is defined as the share of value-added earned by workers in the form of wages, fell substantially. The analysis in this proposal will link these two phenomena and hypothesize that the structural changes in the economy that lead to the decline in the aggregate labor share have also contributed to the Great Recession and changed the nature of U.S. business cycles. Specifically this project will be to provide population-level estimates for how this cyclical behavior of the labor market is affected by the falling labor share. In comprehensively answering these questions, this project will build a novel dataset that links together three main datasets -- the linked worker-firm earnings data in the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) files, the economic information on firm performance available in the Economic Census, and a new external dataset on establishment-level vacancies constructed by Burning Glass Technologies. The project will establish the patterns for the relative cyclicality of labor earnings at firms with different labor shares. In these regressions relating the cyclicality of the firm to its labor share, we will include controls for other features of the firm, such as size or industry, that may both be correlated with the firm's labor share and predict the firm's sensitivity to the business cycle. Using the linked worker-firm data available in the LEHD, we will also look within the firm and explore how the cyclicality of worker earnings are affected by the labor share of the firm in which they work. Using the information from job advertisements in the Burning Glass data, we will explore how the cyclical behavior of vacancy creation and posted wages are affected by the labor share of the firm. This comprehensive set of regressions will enable us to disentangle the margins along which high- and low-labor share firms differ in their labor market responses to aggregate shocks."
