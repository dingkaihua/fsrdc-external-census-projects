abstract: "The project explores the availability of financial credit and its effect on rural entrepreneurial outcomes such as survival, employment, productivity, and sales growth. We will also explore differences in financing and outcomes for minority- and women-owned, innovative, and food retail businesses. Limited access to credit restricts the ability of rural businesses to be economically viable, and retain and generate jobs, effects that are compounded in minority neighborhoods and rural underserved communities. The data we use for the project include the entrepreneurship surveys such as the Annual Business Survey linked to core Census business datasets including the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Census. We explore the variations in financial capital between rural and urban areas, and for minority and women owned small businesses. We also investigate the role of innovation in rural businesses as it relates to financial capital access, the extent to which financing constraints on entrepreneurship inhibit the availability of local food retail businesses in underserved communities, and the ability of federal rural programs to overcome financial market failures due to informational asymmetries."
