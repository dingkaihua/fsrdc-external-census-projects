abstract: "Complex trade relationships and sourcing strategies in industrial manufacturing complicates the classification and measurement of domestic industrial activity. Imprecise measurement of outsourcing-related activities can lead to imprecise measures of industry contributions to economic growth and productivity in manufacturing. This research will improve the quality and understanding of microdata on domestic imports of industrial commodities. The Census Bureau maintains a rich dataset of the universe of transaction-level import data linked to firm-level data. These data, along with establishment-level data collected from the industrial sector, are used to characterize the structure of imports in the industrial commodities sector. The descriptive statistics and regression estimates generated will document structural changes in import flows over time and across industries. This research will also identify determinants of domestic firms' sourcing decisions. These statistics will provide a richer portrait of trade patterns in these important sectors."
