abstract: "Recent economic theories have relied on countercyclical increases in risk premiums to generate realistic cyclical fluctuations in unemployment. We propose a method to identify the sources of this cyclical variation in hiring risk by estimating firm-specific discount rates using establishment-level panel data. Our method relates measures of labor intensity (e.g., the labor share) to previous and future hiring rates and uses Euler equations to connect the estimated coefficient to discount rates. We implement our method using restricted-use microdata from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). Cost information comes from the Economic Census and annual surveys, and balance sheet data comes from the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR). Lastly, we project the estimated discount factor on firms' characteristics, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms at play. We show that financial frictions are crucial for understanding cyclical fluctuations in unemployment, specifically for small firms that depend on banking lending. We conclude the paper by providing a set of moments and mechanisms that are important to understand the cyclical behavior of labor demand and that need to be accounted for in theoretical models of the business cycles."
