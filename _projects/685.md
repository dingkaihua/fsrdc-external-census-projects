abstract: "Whether or not small businesses oﬀer health insurance to their employees is a critical factor in the health care coverage of many Americans, yet little is known about the relationship between health care costs and business growth. The project links data from the annual Medical Expenditure Panel Survey—Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) data ﬁ les to each other as well as to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The study would use MEPS-IC data from 1996 to the present, longitudinally linked using the LBD, to examine the relation-ship between offering health insurance and ﬁrm outcomes. The primary emphasis is on the eﬀect of insurance oﬀering on ﬁrm performance, rather than the eﬀects of ﬁrm performance on the decision to oﬀer insurance. The project uses diﬀerences over time for establishments that are observed more than once to estimate these eﬀects, using instrumental variables to deal with endogeneity. The project also will develop a methodology for estimating non-response to the MEPS-IC."
