abstract: "This project investigates the degree to which production schedules and capacity utilization decisions are driven by companies' financial accounting goals, such as meeting the consensus analyst earnings forecast. It also examines the role that capacity utilization plays in the time series of financial accounting information and how analysts and investors react to them. Of particular interest in addressing this question is whether the recent change in the financial accounting treatment of capacity costs has improved the quality of the data, as perceived by analysts and investors. Thirdly, the project analyzes how product costs vary with the level of capacity utilization."
