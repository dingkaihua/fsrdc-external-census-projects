abstract: "This project explains whether and how the Census 2000 mobilization efforts influenced public cooperation, particularly among minorities. Preliminary analysis using Knowledge Networks data finds mailback cooperation was negatively impacted by the privacy debate but positively effected by mobilization efforts.  We propose a similar analysis with the NORC?s Census 2000 Integrated Partnership and Marketing Program. NORC data includes a validated measure of Census behavior that is essential for our analysis, and not available in the Knowledge Network data. The findings from this study should help lead to improved data collection and a better understanding of the dynamics of Census 2000. "
