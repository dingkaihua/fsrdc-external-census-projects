abstract: "This research uses data from the Current Population Survey supplement on volunteering to explore how community cohesion affects volunteering behavior and how the effects of community cohesion (racial diversity, income inequality and mobility) differ across individual-level racial characteristics. A growing body of empirical research on civic engagement suggests that the effects of community cohesion differ across people of different racial backgrounds. However, there are limited studies specifically in the context of volunteering. The restricted-use data enables the researchers to merge in community characteristics at the smallest level of geography possible, which is important for individual volunteering behavior. It also enables researchers to include respondents from rural communities, reducing the bias in the results, and improving our understanding of volunteering in rural communities."
