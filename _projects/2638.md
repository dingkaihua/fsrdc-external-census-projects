abstract: "How do secure lenders' exposure to the environmental clean-up costs of their debtors affect their debtors' financial and economic outcomes? The relationship is theoretically ambiguous. Banks could reduce the quantity and maturity of credit, making financial constraints more binding and thus increasing the incentive of firms to pollute. However, banks could monitor their debtors and incentive them to reduce pollution. We could also expect a small and non-significant effect, as these constraints could not be binding. This paper studies this question by estimating difference-in-differences model exploiting several court rulings from the last three decades on a dataset constructed using EPA forms, Compustats as well as the LBD. The results are expected to shed light on the role of banks in affecting their debtor's collateral and inform policymakers on how to implement cost-effective policies to implement better pollution management practices."
