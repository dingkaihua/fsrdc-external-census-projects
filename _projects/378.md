abstract: "This study intends to examine the effects of increased economic integration on labor demand elasticities of skilled and unskilled labor, focusing on the effects of international trade, specifically outsourcing, as well as increased capital flows. Rodrik (1997) suggests that increased possibility of substituting domestic labor with its foreign counterparts through outsourcing and foreign direct investment should make labor demand more elastic. Greater product markets competition is also likely to flatten the labor demand curve. More intense competition in the final goods market is observed due to decline in trade protection and entry of less developed nations into production in manufacturing sector as a result of increased transmission of technology worldwide. The validity of the Rodrik hypothesis will be tested for the US manufacturing sector using plant-level data from the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufacturers for 1972 to 2001. This project will increase the Census Bureau’s knowledge base through the estimation of labor demand elasticities and the impact of economic integration upon these estimated elasticities over the 1972-2001 period for establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufacturers. A second benefit of this project will be understanding and/or improving the quality of data produced, by attempting to identify possible directions and magnitudes of the biases in the estimated coefficients resulting from the inclusion of imputed variables. I also intend to compile a summary of information regarding imputations throughout the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufacturers in order to assist further research using this dataset. Final benefit of this study to the Census Bureau will be enhancing the data collected, by improving imputations for non-response. I will identify possible problems with the imputation techniques used regarding the usage of prior survey information on payroll and employment to predict currently unavailable data, in conjunction with current year BLS aggregates."
