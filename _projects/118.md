abstract: "The first part of the project will examine the role of worker characteristics (education, training, gender, race, turnover), establishment characteristics (capital stock, materials, unionization, age of the establishment, computer usage, age of the capital stock) and innovations in workplace practices (profit-sharing, team work, employee involvement in decision making, TQM, reengineering, and job rotation) on labor productivity.  The second part of the analysis examines the relationship between workplace innovation and labor costs and profits.  We will analyze whether the relative wages of workers who work in businesses characterized by high performance workplace (HPW) practices reflect or not their  marginal products.  Finally we study how employer characteristics and past history affect the probability of adopting HPW practices and how this may affect analyses of the productivity effects of these practices."
