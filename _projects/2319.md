abstract: "This project utilizes the firm- and establishment-level data at the U.S. Census Bureau to advance our understanding of employment dynamics in U.S. firms and establishments.  We analyze how firms and establishment grow, and how the patterns of growth have changed over time and over different phases of the business cycle.  We first document facts on firm growth, paying special attention to two different margins: increasing the average establishment size (the intensive margin) and increasing the number of establishment for a given firm (the extensive margin).  After establishing basic facts, we plan to construct and estimate models of firm dynamics to gain insight on the mechanics of employment dynamics in firm level, and analyze the macroeconomic implications."
