abstract: "Despite the fact that the non-profit sector employs roughly 10% of the American workforce, making it the third largest workforce behind retail and manufacturing, relatively little is known about its employees. Indeed, very few studies conduct a detailed analysis of a particular sector. Those that do consider a narrower subset of workers, are mainly concerned with public sector workers, and do not focus exclusively on charity employees. This project will be the first to use administrative data to paint a picture of the U.S. non-profit sector, and answer important questions such as who works in the non-profit sector, and how do shocks and government policies affect its employees.

Up until now, researchers have used survey data to focus on the motivation of non-profit workers, and how their behavior differs from for-profit workers. Using British panel data, Gregg et al. (2011) show that non-profit workers are more likely to donate their labor (as measured by unpaid overtime), than their for-profit counterparts. In the U.S. context, Houston (2000, 2006) finds that public employees place a higher value on intrinsic reward, and government employees are more likely to volunteer for charities and donate blood than for-profit employees. However, they found no difference among public service and private employees in terms of individual philanthropy. This is in contrast to Buurman et al (2012), who conclude from a Dutch survey that public sector employees contribute less to charity because they feel that they contribute enough to society at work for too little pay.

Therefore, although we know something about the motivations of charity employees, we know very little about their basic demographics, how they interact with the charity labor market, and how they move between the for- and non-profit sectors. Furthermore, understanding how organization-level shocks affect charity employees, and how government policies affect non-profit employment decisions will add to our knowledge of the charity labor market and contribute to the policy debate over the benefits of public versus private provision of services.

The use of administrative data is crucial in our setting; the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) is the only data source that allows us to focus on the employer-employee relationship in the United States. Using the LEHD also provides several benefits over using survey data, such as larger sample sizes and avoiding concerns about non-random measurement error. Indeed, previous studies have found the size of the non-profit sector to be misrepresented in surveys (Millard and Machin, 2007)."
