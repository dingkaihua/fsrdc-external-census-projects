abstract: "The overall goal of this proposed project is to probe whether a randomly-assigned offer to move to improved opportunity housing and neighborhood, via a government-subsidized housing voucher, compared being randomly assigned to no voucher (the public housing control group), influences long-term mortality risk, or fertility risk/birth outcomes, housing, neighborhood, household/family formation outcomes, or socioeconomic status, over 27 years. We will then probe further hypotheses understanding how, and among whom, MTO affected mortality and fertility/birth, and neighborhood quality outcomes. To achieve this goal, our study proposes to link the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) for Fair Housing Study data with mortality data and fertility/birth data from the Social Security Numident data and the Census Household Composition Key File. Linkage to mortality records through 2021 will extend the follow up length 11 additional years beyond the last formal active follow up in the 2008-2010 MTO final survey, to inform two demographic events: birth and death. We will examine the longitudinal risk of death and birth, to the household head adults, as well as to the children who lived in the household at baseline in 1994-1997. This proposed study is cross-sector, interdisciplinary, and policy relevant, as housing vouchers represent the largest federal affordable housing investment. It is methodologically very strong, since the experimental design and random assignment is the gold standard for causal inference, and the MTO enrolled over 15,000 individuals in over 4000 families, in 5 different large US cities. This proposed study would test how interventions to address fundamental causes and social policy outside of the health sector has profound influences on two of important long-term population health outcomes: mortality and fertility. We will also examine important demographic and housing outcomes including housing tenure, institutionalization/group quarters, socioeconomic status, and family formation."
