abstract: "This research will examine the antecedents and consequences of employee entrepreneurship within and across multiple levels of analysis. There is little extant literature that explores the importance of interactions across multi-levels in the origination of employee entrepreneurship and its effects on entrepreneurs, the firms that they exit, the firms that they form, and the industries in which they operate. This project studies these issues from a multi-level perspective focusing on the individual level, the establishment level, and the industry level, as well as interactions across levels."
