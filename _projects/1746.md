abstract: "We will investigate methods for producing weighting factors using data from the Census Bureauâ€™s Census of Retail Trade (CRT). This research will provide insight into the quality of North American Industrial Classification System codes and corresponding sales figures for food and beverage categories in the CRT by benchmarking CRT sales figures for these categories against industry classification and product line data from external Infoscan data provided by Information Resources Inc. We will generate weighting factors for the CRT data by industry, geographic area, and year, and investigate potential methodologies for generating such weighting factors in between Economic Census years."
