abstract: "Firms in cities are larger, more productive, and more profitable. At the same time, rents in cities are higher. This relationship between density, rent, and profits holds true in comparisons between cities in terms of size, average population density, and average firm density. This project explores intra-city relationships between firm and location characteristics to understand how firm location decisions affect the relationship between density, market access, and firm productivity at the intra-city level, and to test and estimate a novel model accounting for these relationships.
