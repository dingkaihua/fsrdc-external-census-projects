abstract: "This research will track large firms over time in both the Census Bureau trade transaction data and its Business Register. By tracking firms with large volumes of imports and exports, we will test the methodology used to create the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). There appear to be a number of firms that either do not export one year and then exhibit large export transaction values the following year, or export large amounts followed immediately by zero exports. Focusing on the source of these large changes would help identify potential bad matches, high firm level export volatility or important mergers & acquisitions in the Business Register. This project will also examine whether imports displace domestic production and exports. This would require linking detailed information from the Census of Manufactures product trailer data, detailed information on products used from the material trailer data, other product information from the Current Industrial Reports, and product information from the LFTTD to examine the product composition of U.S. firmsâ€™ domestic production, imports, and exports. A number of firms import products they do not report using and report exporting products they do not report producing. Examining the product displacement from imports would require linking production and trade data at the firm level."
