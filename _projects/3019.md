abstract: "Approximately 1.8 million adults in the U.S. are incarcerated in jails and prisons; another 3.7 million are on probation or parole (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2021), and many more have had previous involvement in the correctional system. The incarcerated population is both a socially vulnerable and a legally protected population. There is overrepresentation of socially minoritized populations among incarcerated individuals including populations with lower levels of education, Black or Hispanic race, mental health disorders, and substance abuse disorders (Collateral Costs: Incarceration's Effect on Economic Mobility, 2010, 2017; Freudenberg, 2002; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2020; Travis et al., 2014). What is more, history of incarceration can be a barrier to employment, healthcare, and social inclusion (Travis et al., 2014) The purpose of this proposal is to quantify the impact of incarceration on mortality and to compare the leading causes of death by incarceration status. The Mortality Disparities in American Communities (MDAC) dataset links 2008 American Community Survey records with National Death Index records from 2008-2015 resulting in a study population of 4,512,376 individuals. Using MDAC data, we will identify incarceration status of individuals 18 years or older at the 2008 ACS completion and will use statistical matching of demographic characteristics to match incarcerated and non-incarcerated individuals to increase the comparability of the groups. Using the matched cohort, we will compare all-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality rates by incarceration status and will further compare these rates to the U.S. general population using CDC WONDER data to calculate rates for the general population. Finally, we propose using survival models to estimate the probability of survival during the 7-year follow-up period and to assess differences in survival by incarceration status. We hypothesize that individuals who were incarcerated in 2008 will have an increased rate of all-cause mortality as compared to individuals who were not incarcerated in 2008. Further we hypothesize that individuals incarcerated in 2008 will be more likely to die from alcohol-related deaths, drug overdose, and suicide - a trio sometimes referred to as "deaths of despair" in epidemiologic research (Case & Deaton, 2015; Scutchfield & Keck, 2017)."
