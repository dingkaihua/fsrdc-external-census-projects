abstract: "Survey researchers are always interested in reducing costs associated with sample surveys as well as improving the quality of data obtained from such surveys. One way to accomplish these difficult tasks is to embed an experimental design within a sample survey that has very focused questions, or rather "hypotheses," thus informing future redesigns of such surveys. This project will develop methodology that allows estimation of effects due to different survey implementations (such as two consecutive Annual Survey of Manufactures redesigns), or the effect of different types of question wording (again, potentially different questions or wording on consecutive ASM redesigns) on the variable(s) of interest. The focus will be on these variables to further address potential improvements in survey quality and reduction in costs, which will be quantified by the effects on response rates and/or completion rates. This will be accomplished by designing optimal experiments to evaluate the data collection, curation, and estimates produced as part of the ongoing ASM. Emphasis of the analyses will be on developing and estimating meaningful contrasts as well as employing a counterfactual approach to estimate treatment effects, where a specific redesign of the ASM is treated as the "actual" scenario (control group) and a subsequent redesign is treated as the "hypothetical" scenario (treatment group). The analyses in this project will use data from the restricted ASM, Census of Manufacturers (CMF), and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) microdata, for the years 2000-2025."
