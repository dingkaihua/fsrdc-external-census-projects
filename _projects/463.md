abstract: "The purpose of the proposed research is to increase the utility of U.S. Census Bureau data especially as it relates to understanding mobility of Arctic indigenous peoples, with a particular focus on Inupiat and other Inuit people. Our research proposes using decennial census long form data (1990, 2000) at the UCLA Census Bureau Research Data Center. In addition, as a part of our analysis, we will use data from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (2003), the North Slope Borough Census (1988–2003), the Government of Nunavut (1999, 2001, 2004), and Statistics Canada Aboriginal Peoples Survey (1991, 2001) along with the public U.S. Decennial Census PUMS and Census Summary Files 1–4 (1980–2000). 
In the Proposed Benefits section we outline how our research will provide the following direct benefits to the Census Bureau: 
(1) understanding and improving the quality of data produced through a Title 13 census; (2) enhancing the data collected in a Title 13 census; (3) identifying shortcomings of current data, collection programs, and/or documenting new data collection needs; (4) preparing estimates of population and characteristics of population as authorized under Title 13. Briefly, our research proposes the following: 
First, we compare household migration and social characteristic variables from other surveys with Census Bureau data. Active temporary migration, in combination with high rates of nonresponse, have contributed to suspect Census Bureau place-level data for certain variables in rural Alaska. Because of the uniqueness of questions in other survey instruments (such as temporary migration), we can test for differences in data quality, identify possible under-counts or overcounts, and suggest methods for improved remote rural enumeration. Second, we will improve the quality of data by estimating the effect of age, sex, and race imputation among large rural Alaska households (age and sex information for large Alaska households was lost due to a data capture error). Third, we use fitted values from private instruments to estimate the effect of nonresponse imputation in Census Bureau data. Fourth, we link private data sources with Census Bureau data to create a dataset, stored with the CRDC, which includes all Inupiat households living in the United States and additional Arctic place-level characteristics. Finally, we provide estimates of migration patterns within and between the Arctic regions of Alaska and the Canadian North. 
The proposed research on migration specifically addresses migration of Arctic indigenous people between rural communities, larger regional centers, and urban areas. We have three primary research objectives: (1) improve the utility of census data in order to more precisely document the economic and social characteristics of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) to refine and improve methods for analyzing migration decisions of individuals participating in mixed subsistence and cash economies in Arctic regions; 
(3) apply these improved methods to understand the particular migration behavior of the indigenous population in Arctic Alaska and Canada. 
We propose to address a number of questions about the causes and consequences of migration raised in previous studies. First, what are the roles of subsistence opportunities and community quality of life amenities in migration decisions? Second, how persistent and widespread are differences in migration patterns (such as gender differences)? Third, what can be said about the role of national policies regarding transfer income, education, and investment in community infrastructure on migration? Finally, what are the long-term consequences of migration decisions: is mobility on balance improving living conditions in Arctic communities, especially the poorest places, or is it draining leadership to larger settlements and exacerbating inequalities? Our approach views migration into and out of Arctic communities as a potential indicator of relative well-being for residents and takes into account subsistence opportunities and quality of life factors, as well as income earning opportunities. Our three levels of analysis include: i.) documenting patterns and stylized facts, ii.) testing community and regional differences, and iii.) applying a household production model to estimate well being by place. The model directly integrates subsistence opportunities into the migration decision and the estimated equations predict how changes in communities affect well-being directly and indirectly through their effects on migration. Comparing the Inupiat regions in Alaska to the Nunavut Territory of Canada in all three levels of analysis, we develop a demographic profile of migrants and migration rates over time and test hypotheses on the effect of changes in well-being on household migration decisions."
