abstract: "This project will help assess the effect of place-based economic policies on firm dynamics (entry, exit, survival, and mortality) by comparing areas that received preference in federal procurement contracts with areas that did not receive such preference. Preference was based upon the economic conditions of the area where the firm was located."
