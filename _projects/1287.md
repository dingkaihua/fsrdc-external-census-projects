abstract: "This project will investigate economic growth at the establishment- and firm-level and seeks to dissect the evolution of the firm size distribution across locations, industries, and time. In doing so, the researchers will investigate the hypothesis of a structural change in the size distributions of firms and establishments and test existing theories of firm growth, providing much-needed empirical evidence that will form the basis for future theoretical work. The researchers will also extend their analysis to the establishment margin of firm growth and characterize the joint size distribution of firms and establishments. To the extent that the distributions of firm size and establishment size systematically co-move across industries and time, this research will document the properties of their joint distribution. Furthermore, since the distribution of establishment size and growth varies across locations, the researchers propose to study the geography of economic production and hope to shed light on the determinants and the effects of agglomeration on firm growth and the firm size distribution."
