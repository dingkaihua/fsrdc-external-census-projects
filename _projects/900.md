abstract: "This project examines the importance of venture capital in the performance of local economies and individual firms. In particular, it examines employment, wages, firm entry, and firm exit at the local level, as well as employment, wages, patenting activity, and expenditure patterns at the firm level, and estimates the effect of venture capital on these performance measures.  In addition to detailing the characteristics of local economies and firms as a function of venture capital involvement, the project will generate findings aimed at improving the sampling methodologies of the Survey of Industrial Research and Development and the Business R&D and Innovation Survey. The project will extend existing bridges and build new ones between Census data and external data on patenting and venture capital activity. It will then rely on this external data to generate concrete suggestions on improving the sampling methodology of Census surveys. Finally, the project will compare estimates of aggregate and firm level performance from Census data with estimates from external data sources to identify any quality issues in several Census data sources.
