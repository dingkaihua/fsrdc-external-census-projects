abstract: "We study the evolution of super-star firms in the U.S. economy over the past 30 years, accounting for imports and exports. Despite widespread discussion of large firms, including the rise in concentration, there is no detailed, focused examination of the productivity contribution and dynamism of the largest and most productive firms in the US economy (i.e., the stars). Moreover, puzzling differences between data sources remain when we consider the growth of revenues and productivity. In particular, the degree of industry concentration, the contribution of large firms to overall productivity growth and the connection between concentration and productivity differ between Census data, Compustat, and Forbes. We propose to leverage the rich micro-data available from the Census to study these dynamics directly."
