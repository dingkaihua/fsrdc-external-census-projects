abstract: "This research will use internal Census microdata on firms and workers to produce population estimates that investigate two broad sets of questions: (1) How do plants adjust output and employment in response to changes in the business environment, changes in environmental and energy prices and other shocks; Which types of workers are impacted by these adjustments and do firms shift employment and output from plants located in a region that receives a negative environmental or input cost shock to plants located in regions that did not receive the shock? (2) What firm, plant and manager characteristics correlate with plant and worker outcomes such as energy intensity, pollution intensity, productivity and earnings?"
