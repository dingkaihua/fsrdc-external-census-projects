abstract: "This research will use Census Bureau microdata for the manufacturing and mining sectors to describe the distribution and conditional distribution of energy efficiency and other production factors, as well as variables that influence those distributions, using both panel and cross-sectional data. We will use broad manufacturing and mining sector analyses as well as industry-specific case studies. We will construct new imputations for energy use, utilizing various approaches to impute energy use when particular survey and census items suffer from missing data due to non-response. Several interrelated activities will expand upon work conducted under prior Census projects, including updating previous studies; expanding the research into additional sectors and generating time series estimates to investigate drivers of changes in productivity and efficiency, including managerial effects; constructing estimates of the quantity of fuel use for plants not included in the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey but included in the Annual Survey of Manufactures and Census of Manufactures; and estimating the relationship between energy use, economic efficiency, and productivity from the dimensions of total factor, labor, and energy quantities for manufacturing and mining. A key component is that much of the analysis occurs at detailed industry levels where the researchers can use sector-specific knowledge to inform Census data collection processes."
