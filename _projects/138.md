abstract: "This project proposes to measure the effects of R&D on equipment spending at the plant level. Beginning with a descriptive analysis of investment spikes, we intend to measure the influence of R&D on the frequency of large investment episodes both in cross-section and (data permitting) in time series. A separate analysis seeks to estimate the effect of R&D on the decision to invest in physical capital. An accompanying theoretical analysis sets forth the parameters of interest, which we shall attempt to estimate based on investment behavior."
