abstract: "Individuals with criminal convictions face enormous difficulties upon release from incarceration facilities. In the United States, rates of recidivism are high and previously incarcerated individuals face well-documented barriers to employment (Alper, Durose and Markman 2018; Mueller-Smith 2015; Western, Kling and Weiman 2001). In response, correctional institutions and governments have established various interventions to help inmates re-integrate into society upon release. Most prison systems in the United States typically approach these issues from a labor-supply angle, offering a variety of training services for inmates, including basic education, vocational training, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). State legislation has focused on influencing labor demand by reducing firms' costs of hiring from this population or by reducing uncertainty about worker quality. While these interventions are increasingly common, there is little empirical evidence formally quantifying the benefits associated with them.
The goal of this study is to examine how labor supply- and demand-side forces that shape the development of cognitive and 'non-cognitive' (i.e. social and behavioral) skills affect labor market, public program, and crime outcomes for justice-involved individuals. We will use quasi-experimental variation generated by institutional features of prison systems and changes in state-level legislation to estimate the causal impacts of these types of interventions. We will also conduct heterogeneity analyses to understand how benefits vary by different subgroups and analyze how labor market conditions mediate these effects. We will do this by combining administrative prison records from CJARS, LEHD data, public program data (SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, etc), non-Census prison records, as well as a variety of survey data sources (Census, ACS, CPS, SIPP, etc)."
