abstract: "We propose to estimate tract-level associations between (1) ethnic background and household income and (2) ethnic background and mobility, as measured by whether an individual lived in the same county five years prior. Individual-level data from the Decennial Censuses (1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) will be used to construct measures of association. Since little is known about patterns of associations, we will start by describing trends over time. Then, we will merge association measures from the Census 2000 at the tract level with the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), which contain information on social cohesion. Using ordinal multilevel logistic regressions, we will investigate whether measures of association predict trust in neighbors, net of contextual controls that are derived from the Census 2000 and data from the Department of Justice (DOJ UCR 2000). Our work will contribute to the scholarly debate on the implications of ethnoracial diversity on social cohesion. Recent studies have argued that diversity in communities diminishes cohesion, for instance, by reducing trust in neighbors. Yet classical research on social integration suggests that it is the association, or "consolidation", of multiple dimensions of social life (i.e. ethnic background and household income) that actually impede integration by impeding the existence of multifaceted social groups and intersecting social norms. We expect to find, after introducing consolidation measures to the debate on trust and cohesion, that existing debate on diversity is too simplistic and that it is consolidation rather than diversity that best predicts trust within communities."
