abstract: "This project will study the causes and consequences of international trade. The researchers will examine how shocks pass between exporters and importers, the interaction between trade and innovation, and the determinants of the origin and destination of firms’ exports and imports. This project will also include data improvements to the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) and construction of sub-national indexes of U.S. imports. Firm-level export patterns to Canada, relative to patterns in the aggregate data at the industry level, will also be evaluated in the LFTTD. The project will also manually match patents to the Census Bureau’s Business Register for some of the most important firms in the U.S. economy. Finally, a link between directories of international corporate structure and Census Bureau data will allow the researchers to evaluate the reliability of the intra-firm trade indicators on the LFTTD."
