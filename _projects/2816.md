abstract: "We evaluate education as a force for shaping lifetime well-being--in terms of economic outcomes, migration and mortality--using data linked across generations. We exploit the 100% sample of the 1940 Census and the variation in school quality and school institutions at that time. The 1940 data allows us to conduct separate analysis of long-term outcomes by the schooling and socioeconomic level of parents. We expect that education will raise life-time well-being in multiple dimensions and that it will be especially important for children born into low socioeconomic families. We also expect that the characteristics of teachers, such as their own education, measured by observing teachers located near children in the 1940 census, may matter to long term outcomes especially in rural areas where educated men and especially women were scarce. Some results will be paradoxical. For this generation, some health reducing behaviors are positively correlated with income (i.e. smoking). We therefore expect that deaths from illnesses associated with these health behaviors may increase with education."
