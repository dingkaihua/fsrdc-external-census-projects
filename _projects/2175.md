abstract: "We study the prevalence, causes, and consequences of eviction in the United States. We will use the 2017 American Housing Survey, which contains measures of informal as well as formal eviction, and the 2018 Rental Housing Finance Survey, when it becomes available. We will first produce national and regional estimates of the prevalence of types of evictions, comparing the frequency of formal and informal eviction. Next, we will document the causes of eviction, focusing on the importance of demographic and socioeconomic factors, including family type, gender, and income level. To inform policy and programmatic responses, we will then analyze the consequences of eviction on housing search, housing quality, and neighborhood quality. We will employ logistic regression models that account for other factors relevant to our outcomes."
