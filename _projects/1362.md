abstract: "In the United States, almost 60 percent of non-elderly individuals have traditionally obtained their health insurance through an employer. Provision of health insurance through the employer creates links between insurance provision and wages, decisions about labor force participation and hours of work, firm demand for labor, and job turnover. This project will use the recent years of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) augmented with other federal and non-federal data sources to analyze how provision of employer health insurance and employment outcomes are changing in response to new options for obtaining insurance outside of the employer-based system."
