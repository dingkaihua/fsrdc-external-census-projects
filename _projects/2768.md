abstract: "The project will investigate the impacts of tariff shocks along several dimensions: (1) trade activities, such as import values, changes in trade varieties, and trading partners, (2) stock price reactions, and (3) operational performance, employment, and investment. Using data from the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database from 2010 to present day along with a collection of data products covering tariff schedules and actions, this project will investigate the heterogeneous impacts increased tariffs have on domestic firms. These data will be accessed through the Florida Research Data Center."
