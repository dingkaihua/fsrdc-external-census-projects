abstract: "This project will investigate wage and employment effects of mergers and acquisitions, and use mergers to test the law of one price in labor market. SDC Platinum and Compustat data will be merged using the SSEL to LEHD data, and an analysis of the data quality of firm dynamics in Title 13, Chapter 5 data will be analyzed. Estimates of the population will include results from semi-parametric difference-in-difference statistical estimates of the effects of M&As on target firms' employment and wage outcomes, and for public firms on post-merger stock price gains. The empirical framework will support testing if results are consistent with a "breach of trust" view of the relationship of workers and employers, where firms with a higher wage premium would experience a larger wage decline after the merger. Alternatively, if firm pay premiums reflect productivity differences, and workers are paid more at productive firms due to potential rent sharing, then a target firm that is acquired by a firm with higher wage premiums should experience an increase in wages. Estimates will also explore the effect of M&A on employment and earnings trajectories of workers in target firms over time."
