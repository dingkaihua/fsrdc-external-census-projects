abstract: "Prosecutorial behavior is one of the least measured parts of the criminal justice system, and perhaps the most consequential.  And it is impossible to study prosecutors without evaluating their incentives, and one of those is election cycles.  As such, I will investigate how voter preferences, the general public, and the political process affects the decisions of local prosecutors (called district attorneys (DAs) in this proposal), how this relationship has contributed to the emergence of mass incarceration, and how the severity of DA sentencing affects both individual prisoner (e.g., length of time in prison, educational attainment, income) and broader societal outcomes (e.g., unemployment levels, crime levels, economic well-being). Most DAs are elected officials, which suggests the public opinion may impact decision-making.  The decision on whether to charge an individual, on what charges to file, on whether to drop a case, on whether to offer a plea bargain, and on the specific terms of the plea offer remains an unreviewable power of local prosecutors. This project thus represents one of the first comprehensive research agendas in the Economics literature that centers the role and influence of district attorneys and advances our understanding of their decision-making.  I will utilize my independently constructed and novel dataset detailing the political careers of DAs--and will use Criminal Justice Administrative Records (CJARS) data --to determine criminal sentencing outcomes of the accused. I will incorporate other restricted census data (including ACS, Numident, MSIS, and Bestrace) to infer causal relationships between the severity of prosecution and outcomes on society"
