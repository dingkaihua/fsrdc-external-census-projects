abstract: "Financial constraints are mainly understood to affect the average level of investment and growth, but little is known about whether and how much they can also impact the allocation of resources across heterogeneous firms. This (mis)allocation of investment capital across firms, especially for smaller firms, can still impact the aggregate economy through two distinct channels. First, the distortions affecting smaller firms influence the decisions of larger firms through product and input market competition. Second, if financial frictions hold back small firms today from trade, investment, and innovation, these firms will likely remain small in the future. While it is known that the few largest firms in the economy account for most output and exports, it is also the case that we know little about how certain small firms ultimately became large. 

In this project, we aim to provide firm and establishment-level evidence in both the cross-section and over time for how financial constraints distort U.S. firms' total output, exports, and innovation and investment decisions. We will construct a detailed panel dataset of firm activity using Census datasets including the EC, LBD, and LFTTD, and merge it to external datasets containing firm-level financial data such as Compustat and Dealscan. Our methodology consists of isolating clean credit supply shocks in the cross-section and using difference-in-differences estimations to track how these frictions affect firm decisions and outcomes. We expect to estimate the effect of these frictions across the firm size distribution and track how these frictions impact firm size and growth over time."
