abstract: "The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is part of the Community Right to Know legislation that was passed by Congress in 1986.  The TRI requires manufacturing plants to publicly report their toxic releases to the community.   Since the TRI started, reported releases have declined by more than 40%.  One difficulty in evaluating the effectiveness of TRI regulation is determining what, if anything, firms have done in response to this "informal" regulation.  This difficulty is compounded by the fact that (1) there are no records of toxic releases that pre-date the TRI which can be used to provide information on firm behavior prior to the regulation and (2) TRI data are self-reported by firms. We propose to focus on plant level behavior to determine how plants have responded to the TRI regulation.  In particular, we will determine whether the reductions in TRI releases are related to reductions induced by the formal regulation of other pollutants, such as the criteria air pollutants, by looking at the relationship between TRI reductions and PACE expenditures.  I also plan to investigate whether changes in plant behavior induced by TRI regulation had productivity consequences.   If TRI reductions are related to more formal regulation of other pollutants then PACE expenditures over-estimate the true costs of those regulations because they do not take into account the positive externality associated with reductions in toxic releases.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that this maybe the case.  This would also suggest that TRI regulation is being given too much credit for reductions in toxic emissions.  Furthermore, if TRI regulations caused firms to change their production processes or inputs in a fashion that changed their productivity, the costs of this regulation may differ significantly from their "gross" costs.  Previous research on petroleum refineries and the cost of compliance in the South Coast Air Basin suggest that there may be important productivity gains associated with environmental regulation.  Both the true costs of the TRI and the ability to use PACE data to estimate those costs cannot be determined until these questions are answered."
