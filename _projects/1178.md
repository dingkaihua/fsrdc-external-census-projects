abstract: "Despite substantial differences in the size, history, and characteristics of foreign-born populations in local areas in the United States, immigration research has largely ignored the roles that local areas play in shaping immigrant incorporation and the consequences of immigration. Some of these local responses have resulted in policies aimed to attract or aid immigrants (e.g., the guest worker program in Utah), while others have sought to deter immigrants (e.g., requiring police officers to verify immigration status in Alabama). This research uses restricted-access data from the 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine the local dynamics of immigrant well-being. Specifically, we seek to understand how features of local labor markets and characteristics of co-ethnic populations influence economic and social incorporation of foreign-born persons, as well as explore how the associations between immigration and native-born personsâ€™ economic well-being is moderated by features of local areas."
