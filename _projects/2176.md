abstract: "This project analyzes how firm corporate governance affects worker outcomes. Corporate governance can be defined as the institutions within each firm that govern its decision-making, and the resulting balance of power between stakeholder groups. Contemporary trends in corporate governance include increased owner control over executives, the emergence of new styles of ownership to fund and restructure firms, and a large decline in the number of publicly listed firms. We use Census longitudinally-linked data to analyze the relationship between these trends and individual worker and worker household outcomes including earnings, employment, and occupational attainment. We begin our project by using novel network methods to impute occupation into the LEHD. We then describe the relationship between corporate governance and worker outcomes, using variance decomposition, regression, and Markovian modeling. We thirdly estimate the effect of firm governance transitions on worker outcomes, for example private equity buy-outs. Finally, we take a spatial perspective to study how the diversity of firms within local labor markets influences local inequality."
