abstract: "Since the release of the first birth control pill in 1960, women’s fertility and work decisions have undergone a dramatic transition. By the turn of the century, the high fertility rates and low participation of the Baby Boom had evolved into high employment and high childlessness. While recent work links oral contraception to changes in fertility and marital timing and changes in the labor-force participation rates of younger women, these studies do not explore the importance of oral contraception in reshaping the career and mobility decisions of young women. Moreover, research on the changing gender gap does not consider the significance of greater fertility control on inter-mediate mobility decisions and, by extension, longer term wage and employment outcomes. The relationship of each of these outcomes with fertility control are interesting per se, but they may also provide insight as to how women were successful in “swimming upstream” in times of rising wage inequality and why changes in the gender gap appear to have stagnated since 1990.  The proposed project will explore dimensions of career mobility that have been important to women’s economic advancement since 1968—the importance of interstate mobility in determining educational, occupational, and employment paths and labor-force outcomes; how the importance of mobility has changed over time; and how changes in women’s career mobility might be related to oral contraception.  The project uses the restricted access geographic identifiers both in the March Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature Women.  These data facilitate both a comparative and descriptive analysis as well as an experimental evaluation of the origins and nature of the second demographic transition and the quality and shortcomings of the Current Population Survey in light of these population changes."
