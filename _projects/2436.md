abstract: "The project demonstrates how linkages between court, federal, and state data build knowledge about the relationships between housing insecurity, racial inequities, and civil court participation. A deficit of high-quality accessible data impedes the study and development of evidence-based policies in the civil justice arena, and will cripple evidence building and policy responses during pandemic recovery unless more knowledge is created.  This project develops methods to produce statistics characterizing parties involved in civil court eviction cases, noting how they differ across sites and over time.

The project addresses knowledge and data gaps about the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of court participants.  Such data are not collected in the civil courts themselves, unlike the situation in criminal courts where more information about defendants (e.g., age or date of birth, race and ethnicity) is captured. For civil cases, even if courts were to begin collecting these characteristics regularly, the data would not be comprehensive or representative because 40 percent of defendants in evictions cases do not show up for their court hearings.

We intend to use researcher-provided-data from 9 sites with demographic and geographic characteristics in this project.  We seek person-level matching to Census race and ethnicity data, federal and state administrative data, and commercial data to explore the availability and consistency of race and ethnicity data for defendants in the evictions cases, and statistics about residential mobility and labor force participation before and after eviction cases."
