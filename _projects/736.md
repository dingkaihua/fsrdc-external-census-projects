abstract: "Early childhood activities such as preschool and day care have been receiving considerable attention in recent years as avenues for providing child care and promoting school readiness. In part, this is because female labor force participation has changed dramatically in recent decades, fostering interest in the role of children in female decisions about work. This research project studies the child care market in the United States. It links existing datasets to create a unique resource for examining the supply and demand of child care, the labor market for child care workers, how parental decisions about investments of resources (such as labor supply, fertility and education) interact with decisions about child care, and how government involvement (e.g., through regulation and funding intervention) affects the market for child care. The analysis uses multivariate regression and other descriptive statistical procedures (such as cross tabulations and means) to investigate the market for child care."
