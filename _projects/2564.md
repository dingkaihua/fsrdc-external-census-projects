abstract: "Unemployment insurance (UI) benefits in the U.S. are based on state-level labor market conditions. Labor markets in practice, however, are local. Understanding the interaction between local labor market concentration and the generosity of UI benefits therefore helps us learn more about the role of local labor markets in shaping outcomes for unemployed workers. Most of the existing literature on UI extensions finds no effect on the quality of subsequent employment matches. Motivated by the local nature of labor markets, I contribute to this literature by providing the first evidence of how local labor market concentration affects the quality of matches following an unemployment spell. I propose using the Employer Characteristics File, Employment History File, Unit-to-Worker Impute File, Individual Characteristics File, and Individual Characteristics T26 Components file from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau from 2005 to 2015 to study UI benefit extensions during the Great Recession. I will use a differences-in-differences approach that exploits a natural experiment which caused longer eligibility for benefits in some states with otherwise similar labor market conditions as other states. My main approach will estimate how labor market outcomes are affected by the interaction of these exogenous changes in UI benefit duration at the state level and local labor market concentration. I expect to find that the length of nonemployment spells is longer in more concentrated labor markets, and that wages at new jobs are higher in more concentrated markets that have more generous UI benefits."
