abstract: "This research is designed to evaluate and improve the quality of existing nativity questions on Census Bureau surveys. External data provide new information on the characteristics and patterns of migration that the Census Bureau’s migration data are not able to capture at present. The research design involves an analysis of qualitative data on the implications for producing intercensal demographic estimates of the population. The data consist of approximately 300 unstructured interviews with adult immigrants (aged 18 or over) who were born in any of 12 sending countries and who have lived in the United States for at least 3 months. The sending countries represent top source countries of recent migration (1995–2000) and/or very diverse types of migration ﬂows and experiences. The primary purpose of the project was to collect detailed data on what migrant ﬂows look like and to examine the demographic and other characteristics and experiences associated with diﬀerent types of ﬂows. Data include the socioeconomic background of migrants and their education, migration, work, and health histories. These data will be used to address the importance of social networks for international migration, occupational attainment, and residence (including internal migration and changes in household composition). These analyses will identify the limitations of and gaps in existing data that are currently used for intercensal demo-graphic estimates by providing the first systematic evaluation of migration questions since they were introduced. Second, they will provide a basis for proposing revisions to survey content, which can improve those estimates, and, in general, improve the quality of census survey data on the foreign born. Third, the results will address issues regarding the economic, political, and social impact of migrants on American society."
