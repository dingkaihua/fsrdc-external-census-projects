abstract: "This project studies how entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists (VCs)' characteristics are related to their matching probability and investment performance. Three aspects of matches are examined: complementarity between entrepreneurs' quality and VCs' expertise, technological proximity between an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist inferred from patent data, and demographic characteristics. We utilize the LBD, iLBD, BR, CSB, SIRD, BRDIS, SBO, and ABS datasets from the Census Bureau. External datasets include VentureXpert, Preqin, Compustat, SDC Platinum, and the USPTO patent dataset. First, we implement reduced-form regressions to assess how observable characteristics of entrepreneurs and VCs are associated with matching probability and subsequent performance. Second, we construct a structural model that takes into account entrepreneur's unobserved quality and search frictions. By estimating the model, we infer the degree of complementarity and the effect of search frictions on aggregate performance in the venture capital industry. Finally, we construct a general equilibrium model to evaluate the impact of search frictions on aggregate productivity growth. Given that venture capital-backed startups account for a large fraction of successful businesses that generate breakthrough innovations and that VCs spend a considerable amount of time to find entrepreneurs, this project is important for understanding sources of economic growth."
