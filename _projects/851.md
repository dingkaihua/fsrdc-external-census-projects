abstract: "We will compute estimates of the prevalence of multiple-father fertility from 1985-2008. We will examine, at the MSA level, the correlation between multiple-father fertility and rates of male involvement with the criminal justice system.  We will build on these estimates to further investigate the  impact of TANF policy and child support enforcement policy on multipartnered fertility.  Security clearance is necessary because, starting with SIPP 2004, a respondent's MSA is no longer reported, and we propose to conduct an MSA-level analysis. "
