abstract: " 
In order to realize the potential benefits of computerization, investments in additional assets, such as organizational processes and worker knowledge, may be needed. We propose to investigate this hypothesis by combining our own data with that of the U.S. Census Bureau towards finding new ways of measuring organizational capital and how firms can best take advantage of technology. In particular, by assisting the Census Bureau in measuring these changes to the supply chain, we aim to increase the Census Bureau’s knowledge base in understanding the broader implications of technology in the workplace. Our research may shed light on the nature of the recent productivity revival and clarify the factors that are most important to its future sustainability. 
Our aim is that our research will enable the Census Bureau to assess the benefits of collecting data to better measure these technology-enabled complementary investments, in particular, within the context of the eStats program. At the moment, the majority of the eStats program is dedicated to measuring e-commerce revenue, such as B2C or B2B revenues. While e-commerce is an important feature of the new economy, we believe that our work will show that selling products online is only one of many ways that firms can leverage the power of information technology (IT) to create value. To look at only e-commerce revenues would be missing the broader change in the economy that is taking place: IT has compelled firms to reorganize themselves in new ways by reinventing and changing their business processes. We believe it would be worthwhile to more directly measure the underlying data behind this phenomenon. 
We also will help the Census Bureau explore ways to provide better statistics on the implications of changing technologies to the supply chain. In the past decade, firms have used IT to change the allocation information, decision rights, incentives, and ownership across firm boundaries. As the CIO of Nokia, Mikko Kosonen, recently noted at the 2004 MIT CIO Summit, new technologies have led to the emergence of an “extended enterprise.” These kinds of changes in the supply chain suggest a broader data gathering agenda about nature and scope of the benefits of computers and communications. Furthermore, they raise fundamental questions about the basic unit of measurement. Should it be the plant, the firm, or, perhaps, the whole value chain? We believe that our approach can help address these questions and lay the foundation for improved statistics and methodologies in coming years. 
Using a small sample of Fortune 1000 firms, our previous work has shown that the combination of organizational capital and computer investment together drive higher market values and higher productivity. In our project at the Census Bureau, we plan to extend this analysis along the following dimensions: 1) understand the effects of organizational capital after 1997; 2) aggregate Census Bureau measures of plant-level investment data to create a database of computer investment by firm and use estimating techniques to create IT stock by firm; and 3) use Census Bureau measures of Internet use as a proxy for organizational capital. These techniques will enable us to widen our earlier analysis to include thousands of firms of all sizes, across all sectors of the economy."
