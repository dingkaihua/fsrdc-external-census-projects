abstract: "In this research, we estimate how a local property tax increase affects rental housing cost and maintenance quality. We construct a unit-level panel from the American Housing Survey from 1974 to 2005 to exploit within-city variation caused by the adoption of a unique tax law in several municipalities in New York State. In 1981, New York State created the Homestead Tax Option (HTO), which allowed local governments that adopted the law to charge rental complexes with four or more units a higher property tax rate than rental complexes of three or fewer units. To identify the effect of this policy on renters, we use the census-block code available in the restricted-use data to identify if a surveyed unit is located in a city that adopted the HTO. We then utilize the within-city tax rate changes caused by the HTO to estimate, within a difference-in-differences framework, if and to what degree property owners shift the burden of this tax onto renters. This policy-relevant parameter will give insight into the equity of the property tax system in an urban setting and identify how local tax structures, such as the property tax, contribute to increased housing costs."
