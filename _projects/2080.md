abstract: "This study will examine how neighborhood and metropolitan area racial composition influence rental property management. We will document these relationships with respect to 1) forms of management (e.g. direct, by landlords; indirect, by property managers or others); 2) maintenance of properties; and, 3) tenant use of housing subsidies. We are requesting access to the Rental Housing Finance Survey (RHFS) Internal User Files (IUF) microdata, 2012 and 2015 waves, to examine these relationships because they are the only nationally representative data that contain information on who is responsible for the day-to-day management of rental properties as well as rental property and renter characteristics. We are also requesting access to the American Housing Survey (AHS) IUF data, 2013 wave, and CoreLogic tax roll records (if available). Gaining access to these restricted datasets will benefit Census by allowing us to provide feedback on key variables of interest across the RHFS and AHS (as well as the RHFS and the publicly available American Community Survey), thus improving Census products, and by providing estimates of property manager and renter populations."
