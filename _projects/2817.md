abstract: "Colorado, California, and New York public health departments have sponsored oversamples of each state's public health regions in the 2020-2024 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). This project leverages these oversamples to produce prevalence estimates of the physical, mental, and emotional health of each state's children by region and other relevant social characteristics. The results of these estimates will be used by local public health agencies to focus resources for public health interventions, awareness campaigns, and healthcare services where they are needed most to support the health of young people in each state."
