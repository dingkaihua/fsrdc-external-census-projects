abstract: "Two of the primary roles of government are to intervene to correct market failures and to provide public goods. In order to achieve these objectives, governments at all levels have experimented with implementing a variety of policies. This project will investigate how state and local policies affect the incidence of assault, sexual assault, and domestic violence, as measured by the National Crime Victimization Survey. One part of this project will estimate the effects of smoking bans in bars and restaurants on assault, sexual assault, and domestic violence (the mechanism being through changes in alcohol consumption). To estimate the effects of smoking bans on crime victimization, this project will use a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits variation in the effective dates of smoking bans in bars and restaurants at the county level. Another part of this project will investigate how statewide law enforcement efforts to test previously untested sexual assault kits affects the incidence of sexual assault and domestic violence. To estimate these effects, this project will use the passage of a state law mandating the testing of all untested sexual assault kits as an instrument for the testing, and then use a difference-in-differences method using variation in the effective dates of the law changes to identify the effects on sexual assault and domestic violence."
