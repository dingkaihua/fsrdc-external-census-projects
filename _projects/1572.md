abstract: "This research describes how corporate financing and restructuring activities impact firms, workers, and human capital. We use the Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, and other economic datasets linked to the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics to conduct several empirical analyses. First, we estimate the decline in wages and the employee human capital loss resulting from corporate bankruptcy. Next, we estimate the effects of corporate restructuring activities on establishment- or worker-level outcomes such as productivity, employment, and wages. Examples of restructuring activities include investment by venture capital firms or private equity firms and changes in industry concentration. We also analyze the effects of corporate governance/ownership structure on firm or worker outcomes such as Tobin’s Q, capital structure, wages, and labor productivity. Further, we estimate the effects of changes in an establishment’s location. Using the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database to identify firms and establishments in the U.S. importing or exporting goods from foreign subsidiaries, we estimate the effects of off- and reshoring of plants on plant- and worker-level outcomes, such as productivity and wages. In addition, we use the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey to estimate the effect of changes in firm or establishment location on capital expenditures. Finally, we estimate the role of unions in shaping the sensitivity of wages to productivity and analyze how changes in industry market concentration affect the worker-level outcomes such as wages. "
