abstract: "We propose to use restricted-access data at the U.S. Census Bureau to evaluate the quality of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) model for assigning establishments to workers at multi-unit employers. The LEHD model for establishment assignments contributes to workplace tabulations of jobs for several public use data products. We would supplement the LEHD administrative data with survey responses of workplace location from the 2000 Decennial Census long form and the American Community Survey. We would link survey respondents to LEHD jobs and, for each job, try to identify an establishment that agrees with the surveyed workplace location, in order to assemble a survey-based match set. With wide coverage over geography and time, we would use the match set to evaluate the quality of the LEHD establishment assignments. We would also evaluate the assignments in a banking industry context for cases of establishment non-response and employer restructuring. In addition, we would use LEHD, the surveys, the match set, as well as the Small Business Lending Survey to study role of workers in banking. The banking industry has undergone extensive consolidation and technological change in recent decades, so understanding the effects of bank acquisitions on workers and the role of specialized worker knowledge on bank operations and performance would help to explain both the rationale for, and consequences of, these structural changes. Specifically, we would estimate models to explain the effect of acquisitions on workers at the target bank, both immediately and in the long term, which would provide evidence of how banks value human capital. We would also use bank-by-market level variation due to acquisitions, as well as other industry changes, to examine whether bank workers' human capital or market specific knowledge plays a role in the services a bank provides to a market and the bank's performance in that market."
