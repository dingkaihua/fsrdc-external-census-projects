abstract: "This research will consider how workers are affected by shocks such as changes to the cost of investing in physical capital, environmental policy changes, energy price shocks, housing price shocks, and shocks to the fiscal conditions of local governments. Many of these shocks will be relevant for economic conditions like those experienced following the Covid-19 pandemic, either experienced as direct effects associated with economic downturns or through associated government or employer responses to the shocks/downturns. Effects of these shocks may occur directly as firms adjust inputs to reflect changes in effective prices, or indirectly as the shocks change the structure of labor markets and interact with existing labor market frictions. The researchers will relatedly examine how labor market characteristics can mitigate or exacerbate the effects of economic shocks on workers. Specifically, researchers will study three mechanisms through which shocks may affect workers that are likely of particular importance in the wake of a Covid-19 pandemic-induced economic downturn: barriers to occupational mobility, local labor market power, and state/local government finances. Barriers to occupational mobility may stop workers from being able to switch to alternative occupations when they experience shocks. Local labor market power possessed by firms, similarly, can prevent workers from flexibly switching to alternative sources of employment when experiencing a shock. Finally, financial stability of state and local governments may affect how different types of workers are able to weather employment shocks. Assessing the importance of these channels will provide guidance for addressing the effects of economic shocks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic on worker outcomes."
