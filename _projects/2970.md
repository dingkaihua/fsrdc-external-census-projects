abstract: "Obesity is common, serious, and costly. Local data is needed to inform program interventions but traditional survey methods for obtaining local estimates of obesity nationwide are too costly. We propose to estimate the prevalence of childhood obesity prevalence for every U.S. county using previously developed methods and the 2020-2021 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). We will first construct a multilevel logistic regression model to evaluate the influence of child demographic characteristics and area level characteristics (block group, county, and state) on childhood obesity. We then estimate the obesity risk for a child in each census block group based on this multilevel model and obtain county level obesity estimates using a post stratification approach. We will use population level statistics generated to identify areas of high need and where grantees from CDC's High Obesity Program may want to collaborate with local and state practitioners to implement programs to reduce obesity."
