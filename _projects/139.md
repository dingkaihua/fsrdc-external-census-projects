abstract: "Recently, there has been great interest in theories that place the geographic distribution of demand front and center in accounting for the geographic distribution of economic activity.   One implication of this theory that has received attention in the empirical literature is the home-market effect; i.e., that an increase in demand should be followed by an increase in production that exceeds the increase in demand (a slope greater than one).   However, the existing literature has not taken into account problems that arise when product differentiation is important and data is aggregated across differentiated products.  In this case, the relationship between production and local demand should be convex and the slope will be greater than one only when evaluated at high levels of demand.
The proposed project will use data from the Census of  Wholesale trade  to examine the relationship between wholesale activity and local demand as proxied by population.   The project will examine the extent to which the relationship is convex and whether the slope is relatively steep when evaluated at high levels of demand, as predicted by the theory.  The paper will also examine whether the convexity in the relationship for aggregate-level industries emerges from the aggregation of narrowly-defined industries, as predicted by the theory."
