abstract: "We propose to analyze restricted data from the Census 2000 Long Form and the 2000–2003 American Community Survey (ACS) to further the understanding of respondent/enumerator error in responses to the “employment disability” question in these surveys.   We propose to extend previous work to investigate the following questions: (1) What factors influence enumerator/respondent error in the employment disability question, and what groups are having difficulty with the employment disability question? (2) What is the impact of respondent/enumerator error on the estimates of employment dis-ability and overall disability; in other words, what would the Census 2000 statistics and 2000–2002 ACS statistics have looked like without respondent/enumerator error? Restricted data are needed because the Public Use Microdata Sample files do not contain enumerations information.   The benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau are an increased understanding of (a) the bene-fits (in terms of the reduction of respondent/enumerator error) of using the more advanced ACS enumeration process over the more costly Census 2000 enumeration process; (b) the types of individuals that had difficulty responding to the complex set of disability items; (c) the degree of respondent error that may still exist within the 2003 ACS; and (d) with this information, the ongoing process of developing and cognitively testing disability questions will be informed by helping refine the groups of individuals that should be targeted by cognitive testing. The ACS disability questions are in the process of being revised for the 2008 ACS."
