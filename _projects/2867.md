abstract: "Approximately 18.5% of children under the age of 18 have a special healthcare need, representing a 6% increase since 2001. Despite the prevalence of children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN), very little is known about how providing care for CSHCN impacts parent health and stress. This project uses the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) in combination with external data from the Health Resources and Services Administration to determine the effects of condition severity and care coordination on parent health and stress according to sociodemographic and geographic factors, such as living in health resource shortage or rural areas. Findings will provide a direct response to federal initiatives aimed at standardizing and evaluating child healthcare coordination.."
