abstract: "This project seeks to investigate the role that residents' residential outside options - defined as the expected welfare loss experienced by residents who are displaced from their current neighborhood - play in determining the impacts of neighborhood change and place-based policies on residential mobility and other outcomes. We specify a simple model of residential choice from which we derive a measure of residents' residential outside options that depends on the cross-sectional distribution of similar households across neighborhoods. Using the Census Bureau's Decennial Census and American Community Survey data, as well as the MAFARF/MAFX, we will estimate the impacts of neighborhood change driven by rising demand for inner-city urban housing on incumbent residents and how these impacts depend on incumbent residents' residential outside options. Similarly, we will estimate the impacts of place-based policies and how these impacts depend on residential outside options. The place-based policies we plan to analyze include rent control policies, housing choice vouchers, changes in zoning restrictions, changes to school funding formulas, taxes and subsidies for new housing development, and affordable housing requirements."
