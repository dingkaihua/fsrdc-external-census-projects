abstract: "This project explores the characteristics of the overseas trading partners, and how the various dimensions of U.S. importer heterogeneity, characteristics of U.S. importers, and importer types affects the performance of exporting firms in the manufacturing sector in India over time. The project will match a database of Indian firms provided by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)-Prowess with the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). The LFTTD can credibly establish a causal relationship between U.S. importer types and their characteristics, on the one hand, and the productivity of Indian firms, as well as identify the mechanisms that can explain these relationships. This research will produce estimates of the nature of adjustment of U.S. imports during large crises, and if import adjustments happen at the extensive margin, with U.S. importers dropping overseas suppliers, or at the intensive margin, with importers adjusting downward the quantity purchased from each supplier.
