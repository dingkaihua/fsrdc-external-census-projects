abstract: "The project will link individual records for California residents in the Displaced Worker Supplements (DWS) (conducted in February 1994, February 1996, February 1998, and February 2000), with the March Current Population Survey files for 1991-2000 and the California Base Wage records 1991-2000. The proposed research seeks to address a number of issues in understanding how and why an individual loses their job using matched employee data. From the outset, the DWS was designed to elicit responses on the displacement of workers. Displacement was defined as being laid-off (without recall), a plant closing, or the employer going out of business. This is separate from a workers wish to quit or leave a job for their own reasons. As well as providing evidence on the accuracy of the DWS in measuring the cost of job displacement, there will be substantial scientific contributions and benefits to the Census Bureau from the work. We will conduct an assessment of the accuracy and shortcomings of the DWS in measuring the displacement of workers, of compiling displacement statistics, and measuring the cost of job loss. In particular, the scientific and bureau benefits are the following. First, the work will assess the importance of missing information on workers in the DWS. In particular, the work history and the measurement of wages can both be learned from the UI Base Wage files and their importance assessed. By including these two items into the DWS file, the analysis will be able to assess directly the importance of the missing information on job history, and the problems of reporting a retrospective wage for the last job for the displaced workers. Both of these items will impact how the wage change from displacement is estimated from the DWS. Second, assess the representative quality of the measurement of displacement against other sources of information. Matching the DWS to the UI Base Wage files, a more complete investigation is possible on the measurement of displacement from the ‘plant closed down’ response in the DWS. The UI Base Wage files can determine when a plant closed down through a change in the number of workers at a particular employer. This is will directly assess how researchers view the representative quality of the DWS in its estimate of displacement figures. As part of the Benefit to the Bureau, the research will provide technical memorandum describing the data base development and the differences between displacement statistics, pre and post displacement wages, and the reason for job loss. The technical memorandum will also address the implications for the Census Bureau’s data collection program. In particular, the usefulness of questions on displacement, the accuracy of recalling past wages, and the importance of missing information on the job loss between main employment spells."
