abstract: "This project investigates competing explanations provided by the economic geography literature on why variety-adjusted price indices vary substantially across locations. In the presence of trade costs, more producers locate in larger cities, which implies that larger cities produce more consumer products and have lower price indices. As more productive firms are located in larger cities and more producers locate in larger cities, larger cities are characterized by lower price as firms charge lower markup. Moreover, these theories only consider the way heterogeneity in manufacturing firms’ productivity across locations drives the number of products available to consumers, abstracting from the role of non-manufacturing industries and the growing share of imported goods relative to the ones sourced domestically. Measurement of the productivity growth in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing services sectors is difficult because it is hard to measure the prices of outputs that firms sell, the prices of inputs they use, and identify whether the products sold are sourced domestically or are imported from abroad. Moreover, there has been no research investigating the link between the heterogeneity in non-manufacturing firms’ productivity across locations and the number of domestically sourced or imported products available. This is mainly because it has been difficult to obtain data on the prices of products sold by a given retailer in a given U.S. location and the number of products imported, and sold at a given U.S. location. Therefore, this project aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a unified framework in which the previously mentioned explanations can be separated and quantified by using restricted Census microdata."
