abstract: "The goal of our proposed project is to examine important economic, family, health, and residential outcomes in the Vietnam-era service cohort through an instrumental variable estimation. By using this statistical technique, we hope to provide the Census Bureau with estimates of the eï¬€ect of military service on the veteran population purged of selection bias. These estimates will demonstrate how Vietnam-era males, chosen randomly through the draft lottery, compare with the nonservice population on variables such as income, wealth accumulation, marital stability, and residential mobility. The analysis will provide important information about the later life characteristics of the male Vietnam-era population while highlighting the needs of aging Vietnam veterans."
