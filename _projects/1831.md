abstract: "This research characterizes the two-way spillover effects between the labor and mortgage markets. An understudied facet of home mortgage is its impact on the liquidity profile of the borrowing households. When home equity is low, serving the debt with periodic payments can constitute a real burden to borrowers and may change their risk appetite in the labor market. We document how mortgage debt affects borrowers’ propensity to take riskier jobs, such as working in startups or high-turnover industries, as well as how employment status affects borrowers’ mortgage performance. Using data mainly from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Longitudinal Business Database, and Corelogic deeds, we identify effects utilizing a variety of quasi-exogenous shocks on employment, home equity, and mortgage payments. We expect that mortgage liability discourages borrowers, and especially if the heads of the households are already in debt, from taking a riskier career path and increases the likelihood of staying in a stable job with predictable incomes.
