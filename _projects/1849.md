abstract: "This project analyzes the effects of policy and environmental factors on contemporaneous and future schooling patterns. Our outcome variables of interest include a broad set of socioeconomic outcomes; we focus on educational attainment and household income level. Our two aims are to estimate (1) the impacts of five alternative policy/environmental contexts, holding constant each of the other contexts and (2) to explore interactive effects between some of the contexts of interest, where some birth cohorts in some counties could have been exposed to multiple contexts (i.e. both school desegregation and high pollution); in these cases, we will investigate evidence of statistical interaction in the contextual effects. Our focal contexts include school desegregation policies for school ages; exposure to pollutants in utero; hospital desegregation; introduction of welfare programs; and in utero exposure to salt iodization. We will use external, county level data to incorporate these contextual factors for individual in the ACS and Census data. In each case, the "in utero" period for each person is operationalized to be the 9-months before the birth date. These benefits cannot be completed with public data because public data do not contain county-of-birth information. Therefore, we are asking for access to restricted data.

Economists and other social scientists have long been interested in the life course impacts of early exposures to environmental and policy conditions. However, it is difficult to empirically uncover causal factors on later socioeconomic attainment. Our proposal contributes to our understanding of early precursors to these attainments by deploying a set of "natural experiment" research designs to combine information on exposures based on county of birth. We leverage space and time variation in these exposures to trace out the longer term impacts on adult outcomes"
