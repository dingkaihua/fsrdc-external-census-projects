abstract: "This research examines oil lease and gas well venting and flaring practices, the characteristics of organizational entities within the oil and gas extraction industry, and the institutional environments of gas wells, oil leases, and oil and gas extraction establishments operating in Texas through the use of multilevel statistical modeling. We utilize economic data from the Longitudinal Business Database, Business Register, and Census of Mining, as well as community demographic characteristics from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey. We combine restricted-use data with publicly available information from the Texas Railroad Commission, Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Report, the National Center for Charitable Statistics, and other neighborhood-level resources. We then explore the relationship between venting and flaring practices at Texas onshore oil leases and gas wells, and the organizational characteristics and institutional environments of Texas onshore oil leases and gas wells, Texas oil and gas extraction establishments, and/or oil and the gas extraction establishmentâ€™s ultimate owning firm. By identifying the characteristics of the types of establishments and firms disproportionately responsible for venting and flaring extracted natural gas, decision-makers can better target ecologically inefficient operations and reduce the waste and pollution caused by venting and flaring from the oil and gas extraction industry.
