abstract: "We intend to study the aggregate implications of mismatch in the college labor market, where mismatch is broadly defined as a gap between the skills firms demand and the skills college graduates possess. First, we will construct several measures of mismatch to characterize how mismatch varies by major and over the business cycle through a reduced form design. We anticipate earnings losses when mismatch increases. After estimating the reduced form results, we will build a search model to demonstrate how mismatch is generated through a labor demand shock. Our model will allow us to evaluate welfare, examine the spillover effects into other college major markets, and compute several counterfactuals such as the impact of changing the distribution of college majors. To estimate the model, we will match aggregate moments from labor supply data on college graduates and labor demand data from Lightcast (formerly Burning Glass Technologies). We will use the ACS-NSCG data linked with the Master Address File to obtain information on recent college graduates.  We anticipate that a labor demand shock to one market will reallocate workers to other subsets of the labor market and generate mismatch, leading to lower welfare and wages. This is an important area of research as past research has shown an increase in mismatch for high skilled workers along with large earnings losses from dislocation (Robst 2007). The results may help institutions to better target their major allocations; students may use this information to improve their major choice for the labor market."
