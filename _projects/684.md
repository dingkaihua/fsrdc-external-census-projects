abstract: "This research investigates the extent to which ﬁrm learning and selection account for observed geographic agglomeration eﬀects. A vast literature documents positive relationships between the wages and productivity of ﬁrms and various measures of agglomeration, eﬀects that persist even after control-ling for a broad array of worker, ﬁrm, and other local area characteristics. In many cases, researchers attribute the positive observed eﬀects of spatial agglomeration on diﬀerent outcome variables as evidence of agglomeration economies, suggesting that there may be knowledge spillovers or externalities associated with the geographic clustering of economic activity. This project explores the role of selection in explaining observed agglomeration eﬀects using the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD provides detailed geographic classiﬁcations that permit construction of measures of agglomeration at ﬁne geographic levels. This research will shed light on the sources of observed agglomeration eﬀects, the drivers behind diﬀerential rates of ﬁrm turnover and economic growth across geo-graphic areas, and the potential ramiﬁcations of policies aimed at encouraging or discouraging clustered business activity. This work will also yield a number of benefits to the Census Bureau by identifying shortcomings of existing data and methodologies, as well by improving the quality and utility of the data through longitudinal editing and the preparation of new population estimates."
