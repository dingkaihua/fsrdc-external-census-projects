abstract: "This research will measure levels and distributions of income segregation in the U.S. from 1980 to 2010. Restricted-use Decennial Census data and American Community Survey (ACS) microdata will be used to a) derive estimates of income segregation based on actual income numbers (and less top-coding) than the categorical income data available in Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) and published tabulations; and b) make use of finer geographical detail than public versions of these datasets provide. Using household-level data to model changes in metropolitan area income segregation as a function of structural and sociodemographic characteristics will allow the estimation of tract-level income segregation without being forced to make assumptions about how tract-level income distributions. Structural characteristics of interest include mean income, and education levels. Supplementary analyses will evaluate how income segregation estimates based on exact incomes differ from estimates based on the categorical public Census data. The researchers will also evaluate how sampling variation affects income segregation estimates."
