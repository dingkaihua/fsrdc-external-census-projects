abstract: "This research will examine the effect of regulation on various organizational outcomes, such as output and productivity, and their resulting effect on environmental performance. Our analysis will explore how environmental regulations, such as the Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems, arising out of the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act and the Cluster Rule, affect organizational outcomes like expenditures on information technology (IT), changes in management practices, firm-level innovations in production processes and services, innovation intensities, and rates of technology transfer. Heterogeneity in organizational outcomes across industries, types of innovation, firm characteristics, and plant characteristics like size, age, and location will also be explored. Additionally, we will analyze how changes in these organizational outcomes affect environmental performance as measured by the TRI emissions data as well as Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures survey data. Establishment-level data on IT expenditures will be used from the Information and Communication Technology Survey, Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, Computer Network Use Survey, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Census of Manufactures. Management and Organizational Practices Survey provides information on various establishment-level management practices and manager characteristics. Firm-level innovation, research and development expenditures, and technology transfer measures will be obtained from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey."
