abstract: "This project will investigate racially motivated criminal justice policy using the mid-20th century Great Migration (a phenomenon where millions of Black Americans left largely rural communities in the southern United States in search of economic, social, and political freedom in northern and western cities) as a natural experiment. Researchers will quantify the causal relationship between area-level Great Migration population inflows and local punishment severity answering the question to what extent did increases in criminal justice punitiveness arise in response to growing urban Black communities in northern and western metropolitan areas?"
