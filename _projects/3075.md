abstract: "This project examines the impact of CEO pay ratio disclosures on employee outcomes both within firms and between firms. We first map out how the firm-specific CEO pay ratio affects employee wage and wage distribution within the firm, productivity, turnover, and labor market outcomes. We also split the sample and repeat our analyses for special classes of interest; specifically, we split on employee race, gender, and educational attainment. Additionally, we examine worker sorting into different CEO pay ratios levels using worker "switches" across firms."
