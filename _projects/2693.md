abstract: "Our research will focus on four areas: (1) a higher-frequency (annual) look at more recent data , especially in light of recent variation in programs of interest to the research; (2) adding analysis of the earned income tax credit (EITC) in addition to the minimum wage; (3) analysis of the many local minimum wages adopted in recent years (see, e.g., Neumark and Yen, 2020); and (4) differentiating effects at the tract level based on the surrounding geography (e.g., are effects different in low-income/low-socioeconomic status (SES) tracts that are near high-income/high-SES tracts vs. low-income/low-SES tracts in a large area of other low-income tracts). We will use American Community Survey (ACS) data (2005-2019, and through 2027 as new data become available during the course of the project).

This study will generate population estimates from neighborhood-level models of employment outcomes. These estimates, based on underlying microdata aggregated to the Census tract-level, will increase the Bureau's understanding of the quality of the data contained in the ACS. The estimates produced will not be released into the public domain, but will instead be used in models that examine neighborhood-level employment and poverty status following changes in the minimum wage and the EITC. The research will focus on whether any resulting changes in employment status disproportionally affect socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, either in isolation or when compared to population estimates that are grouped into spatially larger levels of geography. These estimates, constructed from models with Census tract as the unit of observation, will also demonstrate how alternatively aggregated microdata can be used to increase the utility of Census Bureau data for analyzing demographic, economic, and social conditions.

The researchers will exploit publicly-available tract-level aggregates and create their own (non-comparable) aggregates using confidential data. The investigators will generate a panel dataset across spatially and temporally harmonized Census tracts that will allow them to examine local-level outcomes as a function of minimum wage increases. Utilizing microdata from the ACS, the researchers will estimate a model of tract-level employment and employment/income-related outcomes as a function of tract-level labor market features as well as other factors."
