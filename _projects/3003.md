abstract: "Import and export of goods and services consist of close to 30 percent of the U.S. total GDP.  Firms engaging in international trade are exposed to constant unexpected shocks including trade policy shocks, trade conflicts between trading countries, and natural disasters that affected the transportation of goods. These shocks not only pose immediate operational damage to the firms, but the uncertainty in how events might also evolve affect firms' mid- to long-term behaviors and decisions. We specifically examine the effect of these shocks and corresponding uncertainty on firms' liquidity management, capital structure, investment in capital and employment. 
We use Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database to precisely measure each firm's exposure to different shocks. We use Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Annual Retail Trade Survey, Census of Retail Trade, Annual Wholesale Trade Survey, Census of Wholesale Trade, and Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, etc. to link trade exposure measure to firm outcomes. In a difference-in-differences setting, we expect to find that firms that are affected by unexpected trade tensions, trade disputes, and natural disaster rely substantially more on cash, trade credit, and revolving credit line to endure the shocks, they increase their long-term debt, decrease purchase of goods and inventory, decrease their investment in capital and equipment, and decrease employment in the long run. We also expect to find that firms that have higher concentration of trading partners, items that are more specific to some parts of the world are hit more given the same level of shock, due to higher adjustment costs."
