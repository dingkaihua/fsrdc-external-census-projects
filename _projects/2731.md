abstract: "I propose an analysis of the change in wages and job-to-job movements, particularly for women and minority workers, after the enactment of salary history bans by some states and local governments. Recent research using CPS data has indicated small wage gains for minority workers. The initial goal of the project is to replicate those estimates with more extensive data and to identify wage disparities across different gender, race, and age groups. However, salary history bans generate informational asymmetry where a worker's current employer has salary information that other employers do not, barring voluntary disclosure. Thus, they may also induce higher turnover in the form of job-to-job transitions among these same individuals, something not easily testable in CPS data. Towards this goal I intend to use the following elements of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data from 2013 onwards: Employer Characteristics File (ECF), Employment History File (EHF), Individual Characteristics File (ICF), and Successor-Predecessor File (SPF). For more precise information on race, ethnicity, and education, among others, I intend to link this information to the 2010 and 2020 Decennial Censuses and American Community Survey (2010-2020) using PIKs, and to external data on geography, quarter, and industry to uncover recent trends in wages and job-to-job transitions among the above groups and to see whether the recent bans have altered these."
