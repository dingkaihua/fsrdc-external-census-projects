abstract: "There is substantial theoretical and empirical research investigating the role of neighborhood effects in influencing socio-economic outcomes for minorities.  This research output points to both the importance of differentiating among ethnic groups and incorporating neighborhood effects into locational equilibrium models.  Urban economists have also investigated sorting by race when households have preferences about the racial composition of the area in which they live. Less work has been devoted to analyzing the interaction of preferences for neighborhood demographic composition and local public goods in determining the sorting of population by race across communities. We would like to know whether observed differences in racial sorting are due to differences in tastes for housing, tastes for public goods and endowments, or whether they can be attributed to tastes for racial homogeneity.  We propose to develop and estimate a locational equilibrium model to analyze sorting of households by demographic characteristics and income within a system of communities, paying special attention to neighborhood and local spillover effects. Thus understanding the formation of communities and neighborhoods, the sorting of households that differ by income, the demographic characteristics and tastes among a set of communities, and the interaction of households within communities are the objective of our proposed research.  Although issues of individual sorting into communities and the provision of local public services have been studied for the last 50 years, previous empirical studies have been hampered by important data limitations.  In particular, representative publicly available micro data are available only at a relatively high degree of aggregation thus limiting research attempts to understand the underlying household choice process involved.  This research proposes the use of the Decennial Census Long Form (CENSAS) data, which provides a detailed picture of each household's characteristics including place of residence and place(s) of work. The precise geographic information allows us to accurately match the important economic variables associated with each possible choice that a household could make. The level of geographic and demographic detail of the confidential data is essential to allowing us to properly analyze community characteristics that directly effect how households from different backgrounds sort across communities.  Our primary interest is in using the CENSAS Data for 1990 for a number of US metropolitan areas such as Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh (as the decennial data is representative of the U.S. population, the wider applicability of our results is assured). We are also interested in comparing measures of the stratification and segregation of households by income and race across communities and between public and private schools in the 2000 data to those in the 1990 data.  Consequently, we would like to analyze the 2000 CENSAS Data as well when it becomes available.  We should emphasize, however, that our research project is feasible using only the 1990 data.   "
