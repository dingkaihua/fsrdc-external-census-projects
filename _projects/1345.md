abstract: "Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with publicly-available county- and state-level demographic and socioeconomic data, this project will document differences in health care access and utilization patterns among Hispanic adults (aged 18 and older) living in new (i.e., high growth) versus established (i.e., traditional) destination counties. The research will focus on the moderating roles of nonmetropolitan status. It will assess the impacts of individual-level human capital and resource characteristics, such as household income, educational attainment, English language proficiency, as well as county- and state-level contextual characteristics, such as county economic disadvantage, racial composition, foreign born composition, and health care supply, on explaining differences in health care access and utilization between Hispanics living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan new versus established destination counties. This project will provide estimates of health insurance coverage, type of coverage, gaps in coverage, average insurance and unreimbursed medical care costs, frequency of routine health provider visits, and frequency of emergency room visits for Hispanics living in distinct destination types.
