abstract: "The purpose of this project is to generate birth rates by age and race of mother for all school districts in the United States using the 1990 and 2000 US Censuses and the 2005-2012 American Community Surveys (ACS) The project will also provide a descriptive analysis using these data that will elucidate the correlation between teen birth rates and high school dropout rates and how these outcomes vary with the local area characteristics such as the poverty rate, racial/ethnic composition, per- capita income, unemployment rate, school spending, and industrial composition. While prior studies only could examine teen births in large counties at the county level due to their reliance on U.S. Vital Statistics birth data, we will examine teen births and its correlates in rural areas and at the school district level. Finally, the project will examine whether expanding teenagers' access to health care via school-based health centers (SBHCs) influences their fertility rates and their high school graduation rates."
