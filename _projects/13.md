abstract: "The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) is a federally funded program that provides assistance to small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs).  This research project will evaluate the program and attempt to address the question of whether or not the MEP program is achieving its stated goal of helping SMMs become more competitive.  The two indicators of competitiveness that will be used to assess the impact of the MEP are productivity and survival rates.  Statistical models will be used to compare the productivity and survival rates of firms that have received assistance from the MEP to those that have not received assistance.  "
