abstract: "Housing assistance is associated with improved physical and mental health for children and adults and may impact health by improving housing quality and the residential environment. However, few studies have examined the impact of housing assistance on residential environmental exposures and their determinants, such as indoor and outdoor pollutant sources, product usage, resident activity patterns, and the design and maintenance of building systems. In addition, there are limited comprehensive measures of residential environmental exposures at the national level.
This study will investigate the relationship between federal housing assistance and residential environmental exposures. We hypothesize that residential environmental exposures will be significantly different between residents living in HUD-assisted housing programs and residents living in other types of low-income housing due to differences in: compliance with federal regulations and policies specific to public housing and privately-owned multifamily properties, management and maintenance practices, and physical attributes of the housing stock. 

To conduct this analysis, we developed a national, multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI) from the public American Housing Survey (AHS) based on questions about housing quality, physical infrastructure, indoor hazards, product usage, and resident satisfaction. Using the geocodes available in the restricted-use AHS files, we will examine the associations of the HEQI with neighborhood measures of ambient air pollution, socioeconomic, and environmental conditions. Information about HUD assistance program type in the restricted AHS files will allow for comparisons of mean HEQI scores by type of assistance, as well as across income levels, housing type, sociodemographic subgroups, and neighborhood conditions. We will run multivariable models to estimate the relative risks of having poor HEQI scores, overall and within each HEQI domain, between assisted and unassisted households. The proposed study will advance our research understanding of whether housing assistance is an effective tool for reducing socioeconomic inequalities in residential environmental exposures, with important implications for social, housing, and public health policy"
