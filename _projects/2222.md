abstract: "We will link Census data on production and input use to external data on the prices of inputs and outputs and show how the linked data can be used to address common problems in productivity measurement.  Specifically, supply side techniques for measuring output market power will be extended to identify the degree of monopsony power in input markets (markdowns) simultaneously with output market markups, and a model of the optimal utilization of a fixed factor will be developed and estimated.  In each case, we will assess the bias in manufacturer productivity growth estimates that is associated with failure to consider a relevant factor: the need for physical quantities rather than revenues and expenditures, the existence of monopsony power in input markets, and the fact that capital is not always fully utilized."
