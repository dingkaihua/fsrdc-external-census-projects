abstract: "This project will investigate the impact of restructuring activities on corporations and the connection between human capital and corporate finance decisions. Census Bureau micro data will permit us to examine these agendas from a novel perspective vis-a-vis the previous literature, which is often constrained by a scarcity of data. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed project is the first comprehensive analysis on the interaction between employee human capital, corporate value, and corporate decision-making. The research results will shed light on the importance of employees to corporate decisions and bridge the research in labor and financial economics."
