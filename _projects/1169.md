abstract: "This research will estimate the effect of Head Start on maternal labor supply and the effect of Head Start on child school progression. This study will use data from decennial censuses to estimate changes in aggregate maternal labor force participation rates and hours worked per week in response to the enrollment of 3-5 year old children in the Head Start program. First, the researchers will examine the non-response rates on maternal labor force participation and hours worked for low-income mothers by mothersâ€™ characteristics such as education, race, and marital status, and document how this has changed from 1970 to 2000, to evaluate the comparability between different waves of the survey data. This will permit evaluation of whether current weights sufficiently adjust for the non-response patterns for low-income families and potentially identify the sources and the magnitude of this measurement problem. Second, this research will provide aggregate measures for the employment of low-income mothers with young children (e.g., aged 3-8) by education and race, thereby providing measures of the social conditions or well-being of children in low-income families.
