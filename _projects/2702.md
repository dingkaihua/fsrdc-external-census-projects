abstract: "We study heterogeneity in the effects of rising healthcare costs on firms; for example, the effect of rising healthcare costs on smaller firms in comparison with larger ones, and if/how rising healthcare costs have contributed to increasing consolidation in non-healthcare industries. We explore this topic in three steps, employing a difference-in-differences approach in which hospital mergers serve as a shock to local healthcare costs and utilizing LBDREV, MEPS-IC, ACES, and CMF/ASM. We first study the health insurance outcomes of smaller firms in comparison with larger ones following a shock to healthcare costs, testing the hypothesis that smaller firms are price-takers with respect to health insurance premiums. Given heterogeneous increases in health insurance premiums, theory predicts that smaller firms will be unable to fully pass through costs to employees and will adjust on other margins; we next test this hypothesis by studying economic outcomes such as employment, entry, and exit. Finally, we study the effect of hospital mergers on firms' corporate finances (such as capital expenditures, financial leverage, revenues, and expenses) to provide insight into the channels through which these economic outcomes occur, for example, if lower employment following a shock to healthcare prices is a result of firms shifting from labor to capital or suffering from decreased profitability."
