abstract: "This project investigates the role of variations in the level of uncertainty as a key driver of the business cycle. The most important piece of this research is construction of time series measures of uncertainty. This project is to inform the U.S. Census Bureau on four issues. One, the project will help to improve the quality of data produced by the Census Bureau. By constructing measures of volatility from census micro datasets and comparing these with external measures of volatility, the likely extent of measurement error in the census datasets can be evaluated. Two, it will lead to an improved methodology for tabulating aggregate statistics derived from census data. The analysis will aim to highlight the significance of time variation in the dispersion of establishment-level data. The project would then lead to a recommendation to display aggregate variances at yearly intervals. Three, it will help to prepare estimates of nonresponse over the business cycle that are driven by fluctuations in volatility. To estimate changes in volatility over the business cycle, changes in data imputation must be controlled for in the analysis. This project will spend considerable time evaluating the cyclical and industrial properties of nonresponse. Four, the project will help to improve survey estimation techniques by identifying periods of time and industries with higher levels of underlying volatility. If recessions change the response rate of establishments to the surveys, then the requisite increase in the amount of imputed data could generate cyclical bias."
