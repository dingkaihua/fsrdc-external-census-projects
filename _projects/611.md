abstract: "This project uses detailed longitudinal information from all waves of the National Longitudinal Surveys to examine lifecycle migration patterns across education and gender groups.  It extends earlier work examining the causal role of a college education in subsequent geographic mobility to answer the important questions of why and how college going increases long distance mobility.  Educational differences in migration primarily occur between the college educated and everyone else.  The project studies gender differences in lifetime migration patterns, particularly the manner in which these have evolved across cohorts.  Migration patterns for women may have changed along with the dramatic increase in education and labor force participation that women experience over the latter half of the twentieth century.  The research involves two stages. The first employs longitudinal data to construct complete migration histories of a representative sample of U.S. residents. The second stage builds on the first, using information in the migration histories to test ideas about which mechanisms explain the different rates of long distance moves across education and gender groups."
