abstract: "The war on Poverty led to the 1965 Appalachian Regional Development Act which created the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).  Persistent and severe poverty in the region has been of deep concern to policy makers for even longer.  Low migration rates both within and out of the region have caused many to posit a poverty trap.  Homeownership rates in Appalachia, however, are higher than the rest of the U.S.  Migration and homeownership are known to be linked.  This project uses links of the American Community Survey and the Core Logic and Black Knight data to establish homeownership and measure migration both within the Appalachian region and the rest of the U.S.  Further links between Decennial Census micro data may also be used to measure homeownership and migration.  The project will investigate whether the link between homeownership and migration is different in Appalachia than the rest of the U.S. and how that link may contribute to a "poverty trap" preventing individuals from escaping poverty."
