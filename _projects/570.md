abstract: "This project examines how managerial career concerns, proxied by age, affect firm real investment policies. These career concerns can lead to distortions in the decisions to build or destroy plants since such decisions reflect on the ability of the manager to make good decisions. The researchers estimate logistic regressions to test whether managerial career concerns affect the probability of plant births, deaths, sales, and purchases. The research will also test the “trapped administrator” phenomenon where a manager who is afraid of losing her reputation is more reluctant to cease investments in unproductive plants which she built or acquired and may even try to increase the resources to these plants in order to prevent failure.  This project will prepare new tabulations of public firms managed by different demographic groups. To understand whether CEO age affects plant births and deaths, the investigators will tabulate the different investment projects against CEO age and also prepare tabulations relating the value of capital expenditures, value of shipments, and total employment to CEO age. The project will provide benefits through the production of population level estimates of plant births and deaths and by relating variation in these plant activities to managerial characteristics. Logistic models are used to relate CEO age and gender to the probability of various investment (or disinvestment) projects being undertaken. Additional estimates will show how managerial characteristics influence plant-level capital expenditures. These estimates of the impact of managerial age and other demographic variables are important as they shed light on how changing demographics can affect macroeconomic employment and productivity patterns."
