abstract: "Corporations distribute profits to executives and other employees in the form of compensation, to investors in the form of interest, dividends and share repurchases, and to the government in the form of taxes. Much attention in macroeconomics has been paid to whether investors (capital) derive a disproportionate amount of the gain from the profitability of a corporation relative to employees (labor), and how that share has changed over time. In this project, we use a combination of Compustat, Securities Data Company (SDC), and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) combined with the Census of Manufactures (CMF), the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), and the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to examine the determinants of corporate profit distribution, how this distribution has changed over time, and how the distribution changes after significant corporate events such as IPOs and mergers. Unlike previous literature, we undertake a microeconomic evaluation of changes in payments from corporations to various constituencies within the United States. With this focus, we hope to shed additional light on what drives the share of gains over time and within different types of companies. "
