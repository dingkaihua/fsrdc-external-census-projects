abstract: "The project will proceed in three phases. The first will enhance the export and import information on Economic Censuses and Surveys. We will develop and test linkages between transaction level Foreign Trade data and Economic Census and Survey data and compare the links developed by CES to those developed by the Census Bureauâ€™s Foreign Trade Division (FTD). If improvements in linkages methods are identified, we will provide advice to FTD. The second phase will analyze transaction level detail to examine changes in foreign trade transactions, focusing initially on related party transactions, potential underreporting, and impact of FTD outreach efforts. This component of the project will focus on identifying reasons for such changes. The third phase of the project will develop empirical and analytical framework to investigate the impact of trade on the U.S. economy - focusing on how firms allocate economic activity between domestic and foreign production and the impact of this on the domestic economy (including workers and regional economies). This component makes use of the data developed in the previous phases to develop new estimates of the impact of foreign trade on U.S. industries. It will examine how imports and exports affect domestic production, employment, and productivity. It will also examine how firm responses to trade affect local labor market outcomes."
