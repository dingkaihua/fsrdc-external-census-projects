abstract: "Recently, there has been considerable interest in how closely workers' pay is tied to their productivity. One motivation for this discussion is the fact that median US worker pay growth has been far weaker than the growth of GDP per worker (labor productivity) since the mid-1970s. In
the decades prior to this, productivity and pay growth followed each other quite closely. Research has shown that the competitive model of wage setting is inconsistent with many parts of the labor market, and critical questions remain. How has the relationship between productivity and wages changed over time? Is the imperfect pass-through of productivity to wages driven by monopoly power in the product market, monopsony power in the labor market, adjustment frictions, and/or other factors? What firm and labor market characteristics are associated with firms paying workers close to their productivity?

This project will improve measurement of the relationship between workers' productivity and their pay, and explore heterogeneity in these measures across time, firms, and labor market conditions. The analysis will add to our understanding of why firms can pay workers less than their productivity and what types of firms pay workers closer to their productivity. The main project uses production function estimation techniques to measure the degree of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market, and will estimate this measure across a large number of firms over multiple decades. We can estimate the wedge between workers' marginal revenue product and their wage. Then using another input into the production function (e.g. materials), we can separate how much of this wedge is due to monopoly power in the product market vs. monopsony power in the labor market. Under a model of wage posting with monopsony power, this measure directly identifies a time-varying elasticity of labor supply faced by each firm. As a supplement to this new measure of imperfect competition, we also plan on estimating standard rent-sharing elasticities that measure how exogenous shocks to worker productivity pass through to their wages.

While there are existing estimates of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market, most of the empirical evidence on this topic is not directly tied to theories of wage setting and/or are focused on very specific occupational labor markets (so lack enough external validity for the general U.S. labor market). We propose to estimate two theoretically motivated measures of imperfect competition across a large number of firms and over time. Both measures estimate how worker productivity changes pass through to their wages. The first relies on production function estimation and is similar to how IO economists measure markups. The second is a rent-sharing method familiar to labor economists. With estimates of both measures for an overlapping set of firms, we can compare the two different measures, analyze heterogeneity across firms and labor markets, and document how these measures have changed over the past 25-40 years."
