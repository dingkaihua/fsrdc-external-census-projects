abstract: "After converging dramatically in the 1980s, the gender pay gap has only narrowed slightly since the mid-1990s, especially for highly skilled workers at the top of the earnings distribution. While there is growing evidence that firm-specific pay differences have played an important role in growing earnings inequality in the U.S. in recent decades, there has been less research on the contribution of firm-sorting to the continued gender pay gap. This project examines how much of the continued gender pay gap can be explained by differences between the employers that men and women work for (i.e., firm sorting). Our project will address four specific research questions: (1) How does the sorting of women and men between firms with different average individual-level earnings contribute to the gender pay gap? (2) Have pay differences between employers become an increasingly important explanatory factor for the gender pay gap between the 1990s and the present? (3) How does the contribution of firms to the gender pay gap vary, for
workers at different hierarchical positions in the earnings distribution? and (4) if employer differences between men and women are an important contributing factor to the gender pay gap, what factors are associated with the sorting of men and women between firms with different average individual-level earnings? We will focus on the role of childbirth events and work interruptions following childbirth. Our research has the potential to enable new understandings of the barriers that women face in reaching earnings parity with men."
