abstract: "This research will test for the key relationship between firms' exposure to environmental risks, personal characteristics of firms' top executives, plant- and firm-level decisions such as investment, employment, R&D, and, ultimately, firm success. In particular, this project will advance the knowledge of traditionally overlooked "risk" factors (i.e., geographic dispersion, political risks, legal environment, particularly labor law) that drive corporate behavior and how firms' management of these factors are tied to characteristics of top executives and board members. The project will explore the relationship between firms' operating and financing activities and their exposure to various types of environmental risks and the mechanism by which firms manage their business activities in response to exposure to various environmental risks such as reallocation of resources. This research will explore the performance consequences of firms when faced with exogenous variation in risks. Datasets to be used include the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Longitudinal Business Database, Standard Statistical Establishment List, Survey of Industrial Research and Development, and Business R&D and Innovation Survey.
