abstract: "This project will assess the impact of factors that affect shipping costs, time, and reliability of the nationâ€™s freight rail system. By modeling the choice of shipment mode, the researchers seek to understand how those shipment choices would vary with improved shipment time and reliability. Econometric analysis will estimate anticipated shifts in cargo carried for given changes in costs, shipment time, and reliability. Ultimately, these estimates will be inputs into a model of the national economy that will translate shipment time and reliability improvements into changes in economic wellbeing (welfare)."
