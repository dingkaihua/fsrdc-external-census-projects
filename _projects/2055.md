abstract: "We study the interaction between credit and labor markets with the objective of understanding the impact of financial imperfections on firm and worker outcomes. To do this, we use the Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Census of Manufactures, and Annual Survey of Manufactures, along with data on loan originations in the United States. First, this research will evaluate the effect of credit supply shocks on firm investment, net employment, and the ability of the firm to retain human capital. For this, we create instruments of credit supply shock. We then track current and future labor market outcomes of workers employed at firms affected by credit supply shocks. Our research aims to identify the effects of credit supply shocks, both during and surrounding the financial crisis. Through this research, we also aim to understand the differences in firm and worker outcomes based on (1) lender typeâ€”specifically the role of banks vs. nonbanks and (2) the underlying collateral pledged by the firm.
