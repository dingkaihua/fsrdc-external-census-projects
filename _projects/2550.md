abstract: "This project seeks to understand how the rise of the Internet and e-commerce changes the physical location and clustering of the establishments in which in-person consumer purchases take place.  We are interested in establishments in the "customer-facing" sector, by which we mean both traditional in-person retail, as well as in-person food and in-person personal services. The once-in-a-generation technological change brought by the Internet fundamentally alters the frictions consumers face in searching for goods. Specifically, we seek to answer three main research questions: (1) Since consumption search and matching costs, rather than firm input costs, play a more prominent role in location for customer-facing firms, how do patterns of customer-facing agglomeration differ from those for manufacturing?; (2) Has the rise of the Internet caused a change in the spatial pattern of customer-facing agglomeration and establishment co-location, especially in urban settings?; and (3) Has the rise of the Internet changed the fundamental building blocks of cities - land use and property value?  

We answer these questions using establishment-specific location data from the Census Bureau, combined with administrative property data and proprietary CoStar lease level data for the two largest metropolitan areas in the United States: New York and Los Angeles. The bedrock of this analysis is the Census restricted establishment data (LBD/ILBD), which allow us to understand patterns of establishment location over a longer period and at greater geographic specificity than any work to date.  Supplementary restricted Census data, such as the CRT, CSR, CFI, BES, and SAS, provide important details on the industrial, economic and organizational features of establishments, which can mediate and help to explain the hypothesized changes in the spatial organization of those customer-facing establishments."
