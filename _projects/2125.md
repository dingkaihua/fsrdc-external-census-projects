abstract: "This project will study how early stage capital investment affects startup performance in the short and long term and how owner's characteristics affect initial investment. It will explore whether the investment has different effects across time and in different tech-intensive industries. Structural analysis will be used to separate selection and treatment effects of capital investment. The project will use the LBD, ILBD, BR, CSB, SBO, KFS databases collected by the Census Bureau. The years of data coverage are 1976-2022. Benefits to Census include linking external SDC Mergers and Acquisitions data to explore the extent to which ownership change (acquisition) is captured in the LBD; adding the founding date information of all firms recorded in the VentureXpert to the Census data; providing an estimate of the role played by initial capital investment in firm employment status transition, employment and revenue levels and innovation activities; studying the determinants of firm's initial investment from the view of owner's characteristics; understanding the relationship between private business formation and wealth inequality."
