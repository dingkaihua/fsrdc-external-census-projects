abstract: "Telephone penetration—the percentage of households with telephone service—is the accepted measure of universal service in the United States. This research studies the telephone penetration of low-income households in the United States. One purpose of the study is to measure the determinants of telephone penetration of low-income households, including the effects of universal service policies that reduce the prices these households pay for telephone service. Another objective is to compare predictions generated by the econometric model with standard hotdeck imputations used to assign responses for households that do not respond to the telephone availability question. The study uses cross-section and panel econometric methods to estimate the demand for telephone service by low-income households. The explanatory variables are demographic and location characteristics, including the characteristics of the telephone service plans offered to low-income households. The econometric analysis estimates the price elasticity of demand for telephone service for different demographic groups. Predicted household demands are aggregated to explain the determinants of changes in telephone penetration of low-income households between 1990 and 2000. Predictions from the econometric model are compared to imputations from standard hotdeck methods used for dealing with nonresponses to the telephone availability question. The study estimates the price elasticity of demand for telephone service of different demographic groups and measures the determinants of changes in telephone penetration between 1990 and 2000, including the effects of universal service policies that reduced the prices low-income households pay for telephone service."
