abstract: "A substantial body of research suggests reducing administrative burdens in safety net programs can improve uptake. But some scholars have emphasized that certain administrative procedures support, rather than burden, program participants. We investigate this potential tradeoff in the context of physical presence requirements in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Opponents of physical presence requirements in WIC emphasize their disenrollment effects, while proponents argue they provide WIC participants with important information and referrals to other resources. Using restricted SIPP and WIC administrative records, merged with restricted SNAP, TANF and CPS FSS files, we exploit geographic and time variation in the use of physical presence requirement waivers among local WIC agencies during COVID-19 to examine their effects on program participation outcomes, emergency nutrition assistance and healthcare use. To investigate whether physical presence requirements preclude program uptake, we first estimate whether WIC enrollment increased following the availability of in-person requirement waivers for waiver counties relative to nonwaiver counties. Next, we examine whether WIC enrollees in waiver counties were less likely to redeem WIC benefits, participate in SNAP or TANF, receive emergency food assistance, or utilize healthcare. If in-person appointments support connecting WIC enrollees to other resources, we should find that waivers reduced WIC benefit redemption, multiple program participation, and emergency food assistance and healthcare use."
