abstract: "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is one of the most broadly-targeted anti-poverty programs in the U.S. While SNAP is available throughout the life course, it may play a distinct role in labor market decisions in early adulthood. In this research project, we model the relationship between SNAP participation and educational attainment for young adults, and examine whether differences in SNAP work requirements affect that relationship. In early adulthood, SNAP may play a role in improving the feasibility of time-intensive educational investments by helping meet basic needs. This role may be limited, however, by the restrictions on SNAP access placed on young adults without children, many of whom face work requirements for eligibility unless their state or county successfully applies for a federal waiver of the requirement. We will use the Survey of Income and Program Participation, combined with administrative data on SNAP from seven states and policy data on work-requirement waivers by county, to determine whether work requirements create a meaningful barrier to SNAP for young adults, and whether SNAP access plays an important role in educational attainment. Using a variety of quasi-experimental methods including regression analyses and instrumental variables models, we expect to see reduced SNAP take-up in areas with work requirements, and potentially less educational investment by young adults with such barriers to SNAP participation. This research will help policy makers better understand whether potential students emerging from disadvantaged households may lack access to food assistance that could otherwise help make college attendance feasible."
