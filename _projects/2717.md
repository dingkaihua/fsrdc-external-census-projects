abstract: "Our project aims to overcome limitations of prior research by employing restricted access Census microdata and fine-scale geographic estimates of multiple environmental conditions in cross-sectional analyses that clarify micro-level (i.e., individual/household) determinants of environmental inequity in the United States. Specifically, we will pair Census-provided American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and American Housing Survey microdata with fine-scale spatial data on environmental conditions. The research project team will provide data on environmental conditions (e.g., air, noise, and light pollution; flood hazards; land surface temperature; tree canopy cover, impervious surface; food access), which will be linked to the Census-provided microdata based on housing unit geographic identifiers prior to statistical analysis. Our statistical analyses include multivariable modeling to quantify discrete and intersectional effects of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex/gender, age, disability, nativity (i.e., U.S. vs. foreign birth), citizenship, and language on residential hazards (e.g., exposures to pollution, flood risk, heat), amenities (e.g., access to greenspace, food, water), and protective resources (e.g., air pollution monitoring, flood insurance, flood protection infrastructure). Findings will yield new estimates of environmental conditions underpinning public health and well-being for the U.S. population and subpopulations. In addition, findings will advance fundamental knowledge in the environmental justice research field by clarifying inequities experienced by intersectional subgroups based on measurement of fine-scale individual/household-level environmental exposures, amenities, and protective resources, which would be impossible with publicly available versions of the Census data."
