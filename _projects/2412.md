abstract: "This project will evaluate the impact of changes in Title III rules that affected required standards for limited English proficient students and provided grant allocation on education, income, employment and self-sufficiency. Title III formula grants were established under the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 in an effort to ensure English learners achieve English language proficiency and established state academic standards. By 2007, all states and the District of Columbia had developed English language proficiency standards, assessments, and accountability measures for monitoring progress of limited English proficiency students. This project will exploit the staggered rollout of the program at the state level to determine the effectiveness of these programs on long-term outcomes such as education, income, employment and self-sufficiency. The project aims to link the 2000 long-form records to subsequent American Community Surveys. The 2000 long-form will be used to determine the age, state of residence, and language spoken at home and the linked ACS data will be used to track long-term outcomes. Various methods, such as event studies, linear spline models, and fixed effects models, will be used to compare those were eligible for Title III programs and those who were not because of age and the staggered statewide rollout."
