abstract: "The purposes of the project are, first and foremost, to compare the Unified Database of Arts Organizations with the Economic Census database in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the two databases for research on arts organizations and establishments, and, second, to study changes in the distribution and finances of the arts sector. The comparison of the two databases will focus on three questions:  the extent to which the two databases capture the full population of arts organizations, the quality of the NAICS and Unified Database classifications, and the quality of the financial data.
