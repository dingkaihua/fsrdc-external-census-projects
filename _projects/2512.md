abstract: "This project will assess the value of constructs such as innovation to understand the role of U.S businesses in the international economy and to compare the correspondence between administrative export data and self-reports of export performance.  Preliminary research using the 2014 Rural Establishment Innovation Survey--covering all establishments in tradable industries with 5 or more employees in both metro and nonmetro areas--provides suggestive evidence of the importance of innovation, intellectual property, and skilled labor to the ability of firms to successfully penetrate export markets (Wojan 2019).  Linking REIS to the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD) may support more definitive analysis of the association between establishment and local area characteristics and export performance if the self-reported and qualitative assessment of exporting success generally comport with observed export activity from administrative data. The LFTTD will also make it possible to track export performance through time to identify business characteristics associated with entering export markets since 2014. Isolating the factors associated with better export performance can inform: 1) government policy with the objective of improving the balance of trade; 2) the value of collecting data on these factors; and 3) the value of administrative data in facilitating export performance analysis while minimizing respondent burden. A critical complement to the export performance research is the analysis of differences in the knowledge management strategies of exporting and non-exporting establishments.  Despite incredible advances in information and communication technologies, and new platforms for networking and sharing knowledge, the bulk of research examining the transfer of knowledge between firms focuses on the potential benefits of localization. REIS provides unique data on the location of important sources of information and knowledge for respondent businesses.  Preliminary research has demonstrated that the knowledge management strategies of metro and nonmetro firms are different, reflecting differences in the richness of local networks (Dotzel and Faggian 2019).  Linking REIS to the LFTTD and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) will allow assessing the potential performance advantages in terms of export, employment, and wage growth. This exercise will also inform the value of adding questions to the Annual Business Survey that in 2018 asked about the domestic or international status of cooperators in innovation activities but not their proximity to the firm."
