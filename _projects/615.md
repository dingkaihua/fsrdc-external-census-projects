abstract: "This research project links recent survey data on the digital economy with other Census Bureau datasets and with proprietary data to understand how productivity, supply chain structures, and investment in information technology (IT) are coevolving in the U.S. manufacturing sector.  It investigates the drivers of firm IT investment that are likely to be endogenous in standard models of how IT affects firm behavior. The primary outcome of this research and main benefit will be more accurate and more-nuanced estimates of firm populations that invest in IT, as well as insights into the characteristics and distributions of these different subpopulations in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Another central outcome will be an assessment of the quality and consistency of existing census data on the digital economy. Directly linking and comparing datasets, as well as improving the Census Bureauâ€™s under-standing of the interaction between IT, the infrastructure needed to support e-business, and evolving supply chain relationships in the U.S. economy, will reveal observable patterns in nonresponse, highlight inconsistencies across surveys and years, verify the stability of important empirical relation-ships across time, and suggest ways to improve future surveys."
