abstract: "We focus on new employers, their first employees, and the potential of micro-firms for rural development. Linking internal datasets ILBD, LEHD, and SBO, we will analyze the transition from nonemployer to employer status in rural communities and how nascent employers fare (revenue, longevity). Our models of new employer performance will include attributes of the rural communities. For those new employers who can be matched to SBO, we will analyze the personal characteristics of business owners and how they relate to firm performance. We will also study the first employees hired on by these new employers with special attention given to the wages, tenure, mobility of the newly employed. "
