abstract: "This project will systematically evaluate earnings inequality using LEHD infrastructure files on three levels: industry, worker characteristics and geography. Specifically, this project will quantify industry wage differentials, exploring the role of worker sorting and firm heterogeneity in driving these differences; quantify the relative roles of observed differences among workers (age, education, race) and unobserved determinants of worker earnings in explaining between-firm and between-industry earnings differences; and quantify the role of geographic differentiation in contributing to both between-firm and between-industry wage differences."
