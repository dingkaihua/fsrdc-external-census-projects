abstract: "This proposed study will benefit the Census Bureau under Title 13, Chapter 5. Specifically, this project will produce estimates that will provide a greater understanding of the effects of moving costs on relocation decisions for environmental reasons, which will be directly relevant for informing public policy related to environmental justice (criteria 3). Also, this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of geographic variation in environmental factors with a thorough description of the Californian population by geographic location and environmental quality (criteria 11).

Researchers consistently observe households sort themselves in response to regional differences in neighborhood characteristics such as environmental quality, crime rates, and racial mix of the population (Kuminoff et al., 2013; Tiebout, 1956). Environmental justice (EJ) literature has demonstrated that this sorting behavior can explain why certain types of demographic group such as low-income households disproportionately live near undesirable land uses (Banzhaf, 2012; Depro et al., 2015). If households find environmental harm undesirable, demand for housing near such areas will fall, driving local housing prices down. Low-income households may also dislike polluted areas, but they would be less willing to, or able to, pay for a clean environmental. Thus, they may move to locations with pollution to save money in housing expenditure and use it to purchase other goods.

This project will explore the role that barriers to moving in response to environmental harms may play in shaping the patterns found by the EJ literature. In other words, this paper addresses the question: To what extent do moving costs prohibit households from moving to cleaner locations? A recent finding in Lee (2017) suggests that lower income households, especially those with children, face higher moving costs than their wealthier/childless counterparts. Using counterfactual experiments, Lee verifies that lowering moving costs encourage households to move to locations with better air quality. "
