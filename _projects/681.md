abstract: "This project and another currently underway analyze the child care subsidy (CCS) take-up decision and a range of employment and welfare outcomes among all low-income families in several states. The research seeks to improve the Census Bureau’s understanding of who uses the child-care subsidy and how the subsidy aids diﬀerent groups of low-income families in their quest for economic independence. The groups under study are those who currently receive cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, those who have recently left TANF, and those who have had no recent contact with the TANF program. This project uses data from Illinois, Maryland, and Minnesota. The primary dataset to be used for this analysis, the Social Services Analysis File (SSAF), is an output of an internal Census Bureau project. The primary research questions are: (1) What are the factors related to child-care subsidy use among low-income working families who are eligible for the CCS through employment or training, and (2) what is the relationship between subsidy use and employment and welfare outcomes."
