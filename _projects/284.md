abstract: "Productivity advancement has been a major contributing factor to economic growth in the postwar U.S. economy and more accurate measurement of productivity and growth will assist future industry and government decision-making activities. The proposed research address some fundamental issues related to productivity and growth in the food-manufacturing sector by focusing on the stimuli to productivity growth. By focusing on the investment patterns of Food and Kindred Products Industry, this project will
• Examine the behavior of capital adjustment patterns of plants and firms
• Examine the dynamic factor demand decisions and resource allocations of the constituent units of the firm
• Examine long-argued capital measurement problems surrounding the time series data
• Investigate implications of the empirical evidence for the shape of the adjustment cost function
• Analyze productivity changes of plants and firms under these capital adjustment cost and investment patterns
• Identify and distinguish the gains from investment spikes as indicative of the lifting the plateau to a new one that can lead to longer periods of productivity growth from the productivity gains within an investment period.
Thus this proposal intends to take the literature one step further by investigating how capital and its adjustments influence productivity. Generally, plant-level studies analyzing productivity dynamics concentrate on the overall manufacturing plants in U.S., while studies analyzing productivity issues in the Food and Kindred Products industry primarily concentrate on the aggregate level. There are currently no studies that analyze the productivity dynamics at the most disaggregated plant level, considering all product subgroups of the food-manufacturing sector. With this study, we will be able to focus on investment patterns and lumpy capital adjustment costs separately analyzing all sub-industries of the food sector, which allows us to capture extensive heterogeneity within and across industries. The Food and Kindred Products industry is an excellent candidate for investigating lumpy investment patterns as the industry has become increasingly capital-intensive, and high-tech over the past few decades in the processing, packaging, and marketing of food products (Morrison, 1997). Therefore, the data required for this research is the U.S. Census’ Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for the years 1963-1999 containing the annual establishment level production data for the manufacturing plants and firms specifically in Food and Kindred Products Industry. 
For an accurate measurement of productivity growth, we need to consider economies of scale, productivity enhancing changes arising from factors such as experience, learning-by-doing, increased knowledge, new innovations, better techniques for producing output, measuring relative capital intensity of production technology, existence of quasi-fixity of inputs, and the adjustment cost of these factors. As capital input is a significant component of total cost, analyzing the behavior of quasi-fixed factors in the measurement of productivity is crucial, especially if the firms require massive amounts of capital in the form of plant and equipment. Therefore, confidential Census data is essential to investigate the effect of capital adjustment on productivity and to develop a method, which can control for plant and firm fixed effects in measuring the productivity at plant and firm level. This research will provide benefit to the Census Bureau by developing a new improved measure of economic growth associated with investment spikes. This methodology removes procyclical biases associated with the business cycle. Thus it has the potential to propose changes in the questionnaire design and collection methodology to improve the economic content of the information gathered by the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) in the area of capital input series and total factor productivity at both the plant and firm level. By computing productivity at both levels, the researcher will be able to separately estimate both plant level productivity and firm level productivity in relation to aggregate level productivity. Previous studies have shown that aggregate growth measures may be significantly reduced when using the plant level data. Therefore the disaggregated measure of total factor productivity generated by this research will assist the Census Bureau in determining and evaluating whether the aggregation problem found in the literature is due to underlying economic forces or if it is possibly due to the questionnaire design or collection methodology."
