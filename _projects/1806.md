abstract: "Existing research posits that changes in labor demand represent a source of labor market instability regardless of why the changes in demand arise. I will describe the impact of changes in labor demand on occupational and geographic mobility using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and American Community Survey. I will also evaluate the relative performance of public, confidential, and synthetic versions of the SIPP while conducting an analysis of geographic mobility via the process of worker reallocation due to labor demand shocks. Further, I will analyze the process of worker reallocation to different occupations and geographic regions in response to labor demand shocks, the speed with which the labor market adjusts to instability, and resulting impacts on worker well-being."
