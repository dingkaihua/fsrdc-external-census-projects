abstract: "This project uses the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and human capital ﬁ les to better understand how workforce and production aggregation choices aﬀect estimates of labor demand for skill and inﬂuence our understanding of recent changes in wage inequality. Decompositions of changes over time in employment and wage shares of skill and demographic groups, formal modeling and estimation of labor demand parameters, and correlations between demand and indicators of technology, capital, and trade from public-use datasets will be performed. These estimates will be generated at distinct levels of aggregated producer data: establishment, detailed industry, industry group, and economy-wide. The results will be used to reconcile microeconomic and macroeconomic trends in the wage structure and help evaluate competing explanations for the evolution of wage inequality."
