abstract: "This research will examine the relationship between the use of the franchising business model and labor market outcomes. We will use two datasets: the Census Bureau's Economic Census (2007 and 2012) and the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data (LEHD).  Use of these two data sets will allow us to answer the central research questions in this project: whether and why labor market outcomes vary systematically by ownership characteristics: franchisor versus franchisee status.  The Economic Census asks questions about whether an establishment is linked to a franchise brand.  Use of this data will allow us to identify establishments according to whether they are franchisor-owned or franchisee-owned.  We will link this data to the LEHD data. The LEHD includes the Employment History File (EHF), which will allow us to compute tenure-earnings profiles for workers at a particular firm, as well as the job-to-job transitions of workers between firms, and turnover at the firm and establishment level. In addition, the LEHD includes the Employer Characteristics File (ECF), which gives a rich set of establishment characteristics (industry, ownership, etc.) including firm age and firm size, which will allow us to be the first to address the rise of multi-establishment franchisee-owned firms. The LEHD also includes the Individual Characteristics File (ICF), which will allow us to answer important questions about the age and gender distributions within franchised establishments. Finally, the assignment of worker to establishment within multi-unit firms is imputed. We will require the Unit-to-Worker file, which includes imputed assignment of workers within multi-unit firms."
