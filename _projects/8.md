abstract: "A firm can grow over a sustained period of time by renewing itself through recurrent responses to various internal and external challenges. In the short run, a firm expands and contracts its activities and the number of workers it employs. Some radical changes in the environment, however, may lead a firm to shut down a plant and start over in a new location. Because of this, competition among state and local governments to lure businesses has attracted considerable interest from economists, as well as legislators and decision-makers, regarding issues influencing relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities. While this process of relocation can cause dramatic shifts in activity and employment at the regional levels, as well as at the firm levels, very little is known about the actual patterns of relocation in the U.S. economy. Only a few previous studies have looked at how manufacturing firms geographically locate their production, and most of these have focused on either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This project expands on this previous work by summarizing the patterns of plant relocation and the post-move performance of relocated plants using the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period 1963-1999 using non-publicly available plant and firm level data from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Focusing on an individual firm’s decision to relocate, this project analyzes information on the relocation of a firm’s manufacturing activities in the following three subprojects. First, this project assesses the relative importance of relocation across industries and regions by constructing industry level measures of entry, relocation, and exit. The study then examines whether relocation produces different patterns in plant openings and closings compared to de novo entry and permanent exit. Second, this project studies the characteristics of relocated plants along with their decision to relocate. Econometric model estimation will characterize how individual firms’ geographic shifts of production processes are influenced by taxes, unionization, factor prices, ownership, and other geographic and plant specific characteristics. Third, this project investigates the impact of geographic shifts on a firm’s post move production by comparing the growth rates of output and productivity for newly relocated plants to those of existing plants in the original location. The inverse growth-age relation suggested by Jovanovic’s (1982) firm- learning model is tested for relocating plants to examine whether the inverse growth-age relation observed among young firms also holds for relocating plants that start over in a new space. This project provides a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. These benefits include producing new statistics on the geographic movement of manufacturing activities at the firm level thereby suggesting a new way to expand the utility of the LRD in describing the geographic patterns of economic activities in the United States. Results of this research may also demonstrate the need for new measures of relocation to be incorporated in future surveys. Additionally by establishing links to the original plant of relocated plant, this research examines the consistency of geographic identifiers by potentially identifying previously undocumented coding problems and improves the understanding of regional linkages in the LRD. A better understanding of the dynamic geographic distribution of firm activity will help characterize the patterns of firm ownership that could be valuable for designing inquires on the Company organization survey that is an important Title 13 component of the Standard Statistical Establishment List."
