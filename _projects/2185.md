abstract: "This research will investigate the evolution of the relationship between scientific research and manufacturing capabilities in American firms over the last few decades of the 20th century. The researchers will use internal U.S. Census Bureau microdata alongside a comprehensive firm-level, researcher-created listing of scientific articles published in "hard science" journals by corporate scientists. The linked data will allow the researchers to study the relationship between corporate research and manufacturing and investigate the mechanisms underlying that relationship, as they specifically estimate the impact of offshoring and other factors on scientific output by firms. The research will also describe the allocation of research activity by country, comparing the distribution of research and development (R&D) activity by company location (domestic versus international) to the location of the publishing author(s) in the external database."
