abstract: "The Census Bureau produces population estimates at the national, state, county, and sub-county levels and housing unit estimates at the state and county levels. The estimates are used to distribute federal funds, by state and local governments, and as controls for Census Bureau and other surveys. As part of an effort to develop county-level housing unit-based population estimates, the Census Bureau is undertaking a series of research projects. These research projects are being coordinated by members of Population Division as part of the Housing Unit-Based Estimates Research Team (HUBERT). This research will provide input into the overall HUBERT research project that will be used by the Census Bureau to make decisions about the methodology that will be used to produce an experimental series of housing unit-based population estimates."
