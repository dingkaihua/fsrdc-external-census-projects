abstract: "The development of Oil and Gas (O&G) resources in the US has risen dramatically in recent years as O&G companies have applied the extractive technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"). However, while development has produced a mix of diffuse economic benefits, it also raises concerns about locally-concentrated health risks and environmental justice (EJ) issues. Previous research has been unable to determine the extent of these concerns because of the lack of data with highly disaggregated residence locations that allow for calculating O&G proximity in a way that reflects exposures and health risks that occur within hundreds of feet. This project will use precise locational data from the Master Address File and associated American Community Survey responses to assess whether the risks associated with O&G production are distributed unevenly in the population. Results will help inform policy used to mitigate EJ issues due to targeted drilling or sorting of disadvantaged households near O&G sites."
