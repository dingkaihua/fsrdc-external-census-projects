abstract: "Geographic mobility plays an important role in many economic issues, and thus mobility across metropolitan areas, states, and countries has been widely studied. Recent research increasingly suggests that mobility across neighborhoods is also important, for example in determining the effectiveness of place-based revitalization programs (Busso, Gregory, and Kline 2013) and influencing the long-term educational attainment and earnings of children (Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016; Chetty and Hendren 2018a,b; Chyn 2018). Yet despite this importance, studying cross-neighborhood mobility and its implications for individual outcomes has been challenging because of data limitations. This project combines data from the Census 2000 and 2010, American Community Surveys 2005-2018, and Master Address File (MAF) to obtain longitudinal individual observations with detailed location information, demographic characteristics, and outcomes. We first explore how different types of individuals move across different types of neighborhoods and how these mobility patterns shape individuals' longitudinal exposure to neighborhood characteristics such as poverty and segregation. We expect that mobility will lead to exposure measures that differ from measures using cross-sectional data. We then study the role of individual mobility in neighborhood change, and we expect this will reveal that neighborhoods are more dynamic than usually assumed. Finally, we use these data to study the effectiveness of place-based treatments for incumbent and future residents. Overall, our results will improve understanding of cross-neighborhood mobility, gentrification and neighborhood decline, and the effectiveness and distributional consequences of place-based treatments."
