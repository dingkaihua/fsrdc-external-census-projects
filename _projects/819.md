abstract: "In this project, we plan to estimate a lower-bound on the magnitude of economic spillovers that result from the flow of capital within the US.  We plan to do this by examining the impulse response in the surrounding area to a large shock in new capital flowing into a particular city.  We plan to define this in a number of ways, but the general idea is to contrast the impulse response from a large and unanticipated inflow of new money directed from the capital markets to an inflow directed from the public sector (direct government transfer), which is explicitly not functioning through the capital markets.  We expect to be able to estimate the value that is created for a local economy from one dollar arriving from the capital markets and compare this to one dollar arriving from the public sector."
