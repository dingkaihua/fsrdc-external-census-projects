abstract: "This project will involve a reduced form analysis of the final outcome of outsourcing, including sales and employment changes. It investigates outsourcing’s effects on prices and price-cost margins within the plants of outsourcing firms. Finally, it tests the hypothesis that offshore outsourcing decisions are driven by profit maximization. These effects and relationships are examined using U.S. Census Bureau data (Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Business Register, and the Auxiliary Establishment File), merged with Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Compustat North America information on outsourcing and a range of firm-level characteristics. Research on the effects of offshore outsourcing will provide benefits to both the Census Bureau and its pro­grams in three significant areas. The analysis of the correlation between census plant death dates and TAA plant closing data will make available new information on and improved census capabilities in both measuring and predicting plant deaths. The research on offshore outsourcing necessitates the creation of a bridge between TAA data and census business datasets. Through linking census data to previously unavailable TAA variables, such as employee layoffs and plant closing dates, this bridge enhances census data. Lastly, the research will estimate the effects of offshore outsourcing on various plant-level characteristics, such as sales and employment and within-firm prices and price-cost margins."
