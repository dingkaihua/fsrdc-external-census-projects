abstract: "Information technology (IT) plays a key role in theoretical explanations of economic trends, which are the subject of some of the more important economic policy debates of our time. We propose to study the productive role of IT by matching data on computer use in the workplace from the Current Population Survey (CPS) with plant-level production data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). We plan to employ a new econometric technique for estimating production functions, which allows us to test whether IT affects plants’ total factor productivity (TFP), in addition to allowing for tests of whether IT causes information to flow more efficiently through firms. An important objective of this study will be to prepare estimates of production function parameters and TFP for the manufacturing industries using a new technique, which is designed to produce more accurate estimates than older methods. As we explain in the Project Description and in the Predominant Purpose Statement, the accurate measurement of TFP is directly relevant to the Census Bureau’s stated mission. To study the role of IT in production, we plan to use information on IT usage from both the CPS and the LRD, two sources that are actually complementary to each other. These two surveys provide, among other things, conceptually distinct measures of IT adoption. The CES datasets required for estimation consist of the datasets that comprise the LRD: the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures. Because our techniques employ nonparametric econometrics, it will be vital to have as many observations as possible to ensure efficient production function parameter estimates. Therefore, we would request access to all years for which data is available for the LRD. (This would include the years 1963, 1967 and 1972-2001). Because we will often be making comparisons at the industry level to study the role of IT in the production process, we need to obtain data from as many industries as possible in order to make accurate inferences. Therefore, we would request access to data on all manufacturing industries. All additional data required for the project will be publicly available and would be supplied by the researchers. This includes data on the prices of inputs and outputs, which will be necessary to transform the nominal data from the LRD into real variables. For most years (1963-1996), data from the NBER-CES manufacturing productivity database will suffice. For subsequent years, it may be necessary to obtain the relevant price series directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Note that our methodology does not require us to observe input prices at the plant level. The other dataset we will employ is the public use version of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Questions on computer use are included in the following years of the CPS: 1984, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2001. Moreover, in several of the years listed above, the CPS asked respondents about the specific types of computer applications they used at work. We plan to make use of this data, in addition to CPS data on the industry classification and the relevant statistical weight of the respondents. We will match the CPS data with the LRD data using 3-digit industry codes."
