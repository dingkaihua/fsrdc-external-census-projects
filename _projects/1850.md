abstract: "I propose to link Census Bureau data to U.S. public firm financial statements, toxic release data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a database of employment vacancies by Burning Glass Technologies to examine the impact of local incentives on firms’ employment, investment and environmental decisions. Local government decisions to reduce business costs can potentially affect many dimensions of businesses; however, the impact of those decisions is not completely clear. For example, how do local incentives aimed to reduce business costs affect the seasonality of employment and investment? Do they have any impact on firms’ environmental and employment decisions? What kind of characteristics at the establishment and firm level explain the impact? What individual level characteristics are associated with the impact? Ultimately, do these impacts aggregate?"
