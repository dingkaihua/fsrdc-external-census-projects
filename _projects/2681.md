abstract: "The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship (Baumol 2010) provides a theoretical framework for locating the source of radical, market disrupting innovation in small firms. The newly available 2018 Annual Business Survey provides the ideal dataset for identifying these rare firms and for assessing their contribution to the Nation's science and engineering enterprise. The central empirical problem is differentiating the small firms operating in innovation markets--developing innovations that are made available to market-leading incumbents either through acquisition or licensing--from the much more numerous small firms operating in product markets.  This is likely to be a problem even among the subpopulation of R&D performing microbusinesses.  The project will use latent class analysis and information on founder characteristics, sources of revenue, the importance of intellectual property protection, and testing or use of esoteric technologies to derive a probabilistic measure of membership as an innovation market participant. 
Information on innovation market participants will be used to construct a longer time-series of such firms in BRDI-M (2016) and BRDIS (2008-2016) to map the trajectory of these firms through time with links to the Longitudinal Business Database and County Business Patterns Business Register.  The 2018 cross-sectional data will also be used to test whether innovation market participants operating in Zip Codes characterized by vibrant amateur arts activity have higher patenting productivity than peers located in arts deficient areas: a test of the Leonardo polymath effect where exemplary scientific or technological accomplishments are accompanied by participation in the arts."
