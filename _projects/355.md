abstract: "This project will use factor price and quantity data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) and the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) to perform a detailed analysis of energy data and plant productivity.  The project will be beneficial to the U.S. Census Bureau in several ways. I will check data quality in these datasets by comparisons with publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Energy. I will investigate the extent to which greater detail in energy price aggregates and indices could be published, both in terms of confidentiality risks and whether there is sufficient variation to make this valuable. I will also perform an investigation of data quality and the measurement of technological change to deter-mine whether observed changes in energy efficiency are caused by a response to energy prices, as opposed to misreporting. This study will improve the Census Bureau’s knowledge base regarding manufacturers’ energy input values and the response of manufacturing production and technology to energy prices and use.  Estimates of cost functions for each industry will be used to calculate changes in energy productivity over time. This approach allows measurement of the effect of price-induced technical change on energy productivity by comparing the changes according to the industry’s initial energy intensity. The analysis will com-pare the energy efficiency of entering and existing plants, which will show how much technology adoption by existing plants reduces the total demand for energy."
