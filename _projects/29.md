abstract: "I propose to examine intermarriage among members of racial and ethnic minority groups.  Virtually no studies examine intermarriage between groups such as Mexican Americans and Japanese Americans.  Because these types of marriages are relatively rare, the 5 percent PUMS of the 1990 Decennial Census does not contain enough of many of these types of marriages to support a careful analysis.  Knowledge about the patterns that these types of marriages follow is important to theories about the integration of immigrant and minority groups in US society. "
