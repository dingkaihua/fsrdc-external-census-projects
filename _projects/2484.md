abstract: "It has been well documented that women are under-represented among business leaders, facing a "glass ceiling" that prevents them from professional advancement to the highest levels including on corporate boards of directors. To what extent this lack of diversity in business leadership impacts firm-level family friendly policies and practices, including the hiring, firing, and promotion of female employees is of particular importance in light of the persistent gender-wage gap in the U.S and elsewhere. This project links externally available, researcher-provided data on gender diversity of corporate boards of directors to restricted micro-data available through the Federal Statistical Research Data Center program. Primary datasets to be linked are the Survey of Business Owners and the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics among others. We utilize an instrumental variables empirical strategy to causally identify the impact of female representation as well as the impact of leadership diversity on within-firm earnings, promotion, and turnover differences among male and female employees."
