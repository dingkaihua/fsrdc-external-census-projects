abstract: "This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by linking external credit bureau data to Census data and will help the Census Bureau to understand and improve the quality of data produced through a Title 13, Chapter 5. It will also prepare estimates of population and characteristics of population as authorized under Title 13, Chapter 5. In particular, the project will verify information contained in the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data set and American Community Survey (ACS) data set. It will also generate new estimates of characteristics of population as described below. The researchers will use individual address information (available down to individual's census block, tract, and ZIP code) contained in the credit bureau data to verify employee address information in the LEHD. In addition, the researchers will use information on identity theft and fraud provided in the credit bureau data to verify the LEHD data at the time of such incidents. Finally, the credit data include mortgage information for each individual (including payments, balance, delinquency), which will be used to verify ACS mortgage data (which is allocated at higher rates) and provide the Census with methods to improve the quality of these data.

This research project seeks to examine the effects of debt overhang on individual labor outcomes, as well as new business creation and growth. As a result of these analyses, we will provide the Census Bureau with new estimates of population characteristics not available and examined in the existing literature. We define debt overhang in a few different ways. First, we would like to examine how a high and growing student debt burden affects earnings, job search, and entrepreneurial activity of individual borrowers. Second, we would like to examine how changes to mortgage payment schedules (because of loan modifications, forbearance, or interest rate changes) can affect homeowners' mobility decisions, labor supply, earnings and entrepreneurial outcomes. Third, we would like to use credit bureau data on third-party collections, tax liens, and wage garnishments to examine how creditors' adverse legal actions and collection practices, which effectively reduce take-home pay for affected individuals, change individual labor supply, overtime work, and attachment to the labor market.

This research project will use the following restricted Census datasets: Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), LEHD Employer Characteristics File (ECF), LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF), Longitudinal Business Database - With EIN and Revenue (LBDREV), American Community Survey (ACS), LEHD Employment History File (EHF), LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF), Decennial Census, CoreLogic and Black Knight data (if / when available). All LEHD, LBD, and ILBD files are requested for the years 1976-2022 (if / when available). ACS data are requested for 2005-2020, 2021-2025. Decennial Census data are needed for the years 2000 and 2010."
