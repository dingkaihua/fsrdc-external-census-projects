abstract: "Although virtually all working Americans will directly experience or observe a coworker experiencing the loss of someone close to them during their working lives, there has been surprisingly little research investigating the effects of such events. As the median age of the workforce continues to increase in the United States, an increasing number of employees are likely to experience the loss of coworkers or loved ones, the effects of which are likely to have profound implications on both employers and employees. A significant challenge to pursuing the research described in this proposal is the lack of publicly available large sample data. Despite death events being a common occurrence over virtually everyone's working lives, little is known about the consequences of the phenomenon for employment and organizational performance. Prior empirical work has been limited by available data, and prior empirical settings have relied upon small samples with potentially severe sampling selection bias (e.g., only considering a single occupation in a single city). While valuable, such analyses are significantly constrained in their ability to allow detailed examination and provide generalizability. This project seeks to better understand the consequences of this important and prevalent phenomenon. Several data sources will be linked at the individual- and establishment-/firm-levels, each of which contains measures relevant to execute the study. The researchers will also include publicly available external data on job characteristics, based on occupational codes from internal Census data, provided by O*NET. The proposed project will involve multivariate analyses, primarily using logistic regressions and OLS fixed effects regressions. This project will produce population estimates on how deaths of employees or the deaths of their loved ones may affect establishment/firm performance. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies of its kind, especially with large scale, administrative data, and will provide important, novel estimates on a phenomenon that everyone in the working population will experience at some point."
