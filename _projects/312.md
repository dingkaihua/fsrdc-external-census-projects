abstract: "The proposed study will analyze Medicaid administrative files (including information on welfare receipt) for California linked with survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to explore the misreporting of program participation (Medicaid and welfare) in the CPS. The resulting estimates will provide both methodological and substantive insights.  On a methodological level, by comparing individual level survey and administrative data, we can better understand the nature of the biases in survey responses and the success of the standard Census imputations.  Furthermore, from these results, we will construct simple models of survey errors that can be used by others (without access to matched administrative data) to adjust survey data.  On a substantive level, the resulting estimates will be used to generate improved estimates of the levels of program participation in California and the nation as a whole and the levels and determinants of Medi-Cal and TANF take-up among eligibles.  These issues are particularly important because while welfare policy continues to be actively debated and the Census surveys provide the data underlying that debate, comparisons of aggregate counts from administrative data with Census surveys show under-reporting of program participation of twenty-five percent or more even after data processing and imputation.
