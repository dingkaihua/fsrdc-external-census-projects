abstract: "This project examines the relationship between the organizational form of firms and the sourcing of intermediate goods, both domestically and internationally. Specifically, it investigates a firm's decision to obtain intermediate goods at home (onshore) or abroad (offshore) and whether to produce its own intermediates (in-house) or contract with arms-length suppliers (outsource). This research has three main goals: (1) characterize the structure of intermediate good production and procurement of U.S. firms, (2) develop theory that predicts the observed structure, and (3) determine how decisions of organizational form influence employment and wages of production and non-production labor."
