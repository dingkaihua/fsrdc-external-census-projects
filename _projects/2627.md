abstract: "The goal of this project is to investigate how local shocks propagate across regions and examine the role of fiscal policy in their spatial percolation. To identify plant-level shocks, we obtain information on natural disasters that have hit U.S. counties since 1992 from NOAA. To trace the propagation of these shocks through firms' internal networks, we aim to construct a spatial network of the firm's internal organization using confidential plant-level data at from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database. We first investigate whether there are spillover effects of the shock across plants, i.e. whether plants in non-treated regions change their level of capital and employment following a shock occurred to other plants located in another region but that belong to the same firm. Second, we aim to identify the local government intervention using data on the loans given by the Small Business Administration to firms hit by a natural disaster. To estimate the spillover effect of the policy, we compare untreated plants belonging to firms that were hit by a disaster and were provided public funds, against untreated plants belonging to firms equally hit by a comparable disaster that were not helped. We aim to build a general equilibrium model to quantify the contribution of these spillover effects on the national fiscal multiplier."
