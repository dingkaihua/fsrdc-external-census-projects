abstract: "The United States invests heavily in immigration enforcement, with a focus on deporting immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. Despite the central importance criminal deterrence plays in immigration enforcement, there is little research on the impact of immigration enforcement on the criminal environment in the United States. In our project, we plan to evaluate the effect of changes in immigration enforcement on both crime rates and crime reporting behavior. To measure crime rates and willingness to report crime, we intend to use the National Criminal Victimization Survey (NCVS), a survey that is uniquely able to measure crime reporting behavior conditional on victimization. Our main measure of immigration enforcement will be monthly counts of the number of ICE detainers issued in each county in the United States, measured using supplemental data from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRACFed). We will measure immigration enforcement in two ways. First, we will study the rollout of the Secure Communities program between 2008 and 2014, which enhanced cooperation between local and federal law enforcement and subsequently increased the number of detainers and deportations. Second, we will measure the number of individuals detained by immigration agencies in a county-by-year and use an instrumental variables strategy to identify the causal effect of changes in the intensity of immigration enforcement. Moreover, our analysis will test how impacts on victimization and reporting vary according to survey participant demographics or by the types of individuals who are detained (e.g., their country of origin)."
