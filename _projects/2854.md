abstract: "Our project will examine how prenatal and early-life exposure to the social safety net and poor economic conditions shape the long-run and intergenerational outcomes of youth. To estimate this effect, we will use a standard event-study framework and leverage quasi-experimental variation in the timing of anti-poverty program rollouts and reforms, and exposure to negative economic shocks across cohorts. We will separately identify the effect of these early-life shocks on future outcomes for directly affected youth as well as intergenerational spillover effects onto their children. We will implement this approach with rich administrative set, linking earnings records from the LEHD and SSA, criminal justice records from CJARS, public program participation records from the SSR and state agencies, and survey-based outcomes from the ACS, CPS, and SIPP."
