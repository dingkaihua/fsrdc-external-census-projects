abstract: "This project will examine the effects of labor and capital adjustment costs on market competition and market structure. This question is of particular interest since capacity addition and withdrawal decisions are important strategic decisions that can have a significant impact on price and profitability in the short run. Moreover, given that investment is long-lived, it is a critical determinant of how the competitive environment evolves in the long-run. Although the empirical literature in industrial organization has widely explored the connection between market structure and the competitiveness of market outcomes, the literature connecting labor and capital adjustment costs and market competition is scarce. This project will attempt to fill this gap in the literature by conducting a detailed microeconomic analysis using plant-level data. The relationship between four main topics and adjustment costs will be studied: entry and exit, investment, market power, and technology adoption."
