abstract: "This project uses 1977-2011 microdata from the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) for manufacturing to test whether credit constrained firms are impacted by economic shocks more than the remaining “unconstrained” firms. The question is addressed by two approaches: a standard statistical model incorporating non-confidential macroeconomic time series (mostly) from government agencies, and an economic model explaining how uncertainty shocks impact both “constrained” and “unconstrained” firms. The economic model uses a time series measure of “micro-uncertainty” based on the cross-sectional dispersion of residuals for firm-level revenue functions in the QFR microdata. For each of the “completed” 1977-2011 panel datasets, where missing values are filled in with the simulated values from one of the imputations, firm-level financial fields such as net sales are aggregated by year, quarter and “unconstrained”/”constrained” firm status. The aggregated financial data are merged with non-confidential macroeconomic time series data by year and quarter, and the merged datasets are used to estimate a system of dynamic regression equations to statistically test whether economic shocks have different effects on “constrained” and “unconstrained” firms"
