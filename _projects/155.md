abstract: "The goal of this project is to improve the utility of Census Bureau data by providing new measures of the impacts of U.S. international manufacturing trade on employment, wages, and income inequality in rural (nonmetro) counties of the United States. The project involves two components: 1) regression analysis of the employment impacts of international trade on rural counties and 2) regression analysis of the impacts of international trade on wages and income inequality within and across rural counties. The project will utilize 4-digit industrial shipment and foreign export shipment data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). The LRD data will be aggregated to the county-level and will be linked with 4-digit international import and export data and exchange rate data to create a unique, county-level, international export and import exchange rate dataset. This new dataset will be used to estimate via regression modeling the county-level employment, income and wage effects of changing patterns of international trade between 1972 and 1997. The employment and wage models will also utilize LRD data on average, production, and nonproduction worker manufacturing employment wages. Other data for the project will come from publicly available sources including the Regional Economic Information Systems (REIS) data series and the Census of Population. Improved understanding of the quality of census data will be accomplished through analysis of the 1997 export estimates. These estimates, which have not yet been evaluated in comparison to prior census years, will be compared to export measures in the 1987 and 1992 Economic Censuses. Enhancement of the data collected in the Economic Census will be accomplished through development of a new dataset that relates international trade patterns to rural manufacturing."
