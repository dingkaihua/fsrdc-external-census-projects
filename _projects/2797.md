abstract: "My project aims to study the importance of parental financial resources on the post-secondary education outcomes of their children. To study this question, I will link adult children from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) to their parents in the 2000 Decennial Long Form and Short Form Censuses and the 2010 Decennial Long Form Census. With this data, I will use a generalized difference-in-differences framework to study the impact of local house price changes experienced by parents on undergraduate attendance and degree attainment, student loan debt burden to finance education, the quality and cost of undergraduate institution attended, and graduate school attendance.  My project will contribute to an existing literature studying the impact of parental financial resources on human capital investment by evaluating the importance of changes to parental wealth at different points in the life-cycle of adult children and by evaluating how the impact of local house-price changes has evolved during the 21st Century. In line with existing research, I expect to find that exposure to large positive increases in local housing values in the early 2000s leads to increased college attainment, and that exposure to large negative shocks from The Great Recession depressed human capital investment. It is unclear if the re-acceleration of housing values in the mid to late 2010s will have the same positive impact as increases in the early 2000s, as housing wealth has been less liquid during this time period."
