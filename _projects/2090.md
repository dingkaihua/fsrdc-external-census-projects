abstract: "The purpose of this project is to investigate the link between economic competition and economic growth. The goal is to empirically analyze the effect of competition on households, firms, and industries. Economists have explored this question theoretically, but all empirical analyses use small non-representative subsets of firms or identifies correlational (and not causal) relationships. A fundamental economic question is whether increased competition between firms in the same industry increases research and development, innovation, the numbers of new firms entering the industry, and the number of employees in the industry. One important measure of competition is industry and region-level concentration. We will use Census microdata to first describe industry and region-level variation in concentration between the 1960s and 2017. We will then identify the causal effect of changes in industry concentration on the economic outcomes of industries, firms, and households using lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice against firms and industries, the entry and exit of firms into local economic areas, and data describing mergers and acquisitions. This project will also provide insight into several additional important questions. For example, if an industry is very concentrated, then do fewer new companies enter the industry? If a local economic area has a small number of competitors within a specific sector, does that negatively affect local economic growth? If two companies within an industry merge, how does that affect their competitors? If an industry suddenly becomes more concentrated, how are different types of employees affected? And how do all of these effects vary by region and industry?"
