abstract: "Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, wherein states have the option to expand Medicaid coverage to adults with household incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, has been shown to reduce mortality rates nationwide. From 2014 to 2018, mortality rates dropped 3.6% more in states that expanded Medicaid than those that did not. Although the impact of Medicaid expansion on mortality is well-documented, its impact on mortality disparities remains underexamined. The overarching goal of this study is to identify the relationship between Medicaid expansion and rural-urban ethnoracial disparities, while also estimating the mediating role of poverty alleviation in this relationship. The project will be completed through three specifics aims. The first to be completed outside of the RDC, and the second two to be completed within the RDC. In Aim 1, we will estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on ethnoracial mortality disparities by rural-urban status from 2011 to 2019. We will do so using time-varying difference-in-difference design with marginal prediction analysis via census data and restricted data from the National Vital Statistics System. In Aim 2, we will improve the cost-of-living adjustment in the existing Supplemental Poverty Measure and estimate the improved measure at the county level from 2011 to 2019. As detailed in our Methodology, we will do so using restricted American Community Survey data, alongside the SPM-ACS estimates generated by Fox et al. (2020), to create a county-specific cost-of-living adjustment and corresponding county-specific and county-sensitive poverty estimates. In Aim 3, we will bring estimates of all-cause mortality generated via restricted CDC data into the RDC to estimate the mediating role of poverty reduction in the relationship between Medicaid expansion and rural-urban ethnoracial mortality disparities from 2009 to 2019. We will do so by integrating our estimates of the supplemental poverty measure with our difference-in-difference models from Aim 1."
