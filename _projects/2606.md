abstract: "This project will shed light on key drivers of firm exit and the interaction of these drivers with the business cycle. One key aspect of government responses to Covid-19 has been an attempt to help firms remain afloat during and after the associated lockdowns. Based on a belief that the crisis would be short-lived, but that the effects of inefficient firm churn can be long-lasting, solutions have tended to promote business hibernation by extending liquidity to firms facing fixed operating costs but diminished cash inflows. The underlying premise assumes a tight link between financial distress and bankruptcy that does not necessarily depend on firm fundamentals, a premise that contrasts with workhorse models of firm dynamics in which exit patterns greatly depend on firms' idiosyncratic productivity levels. Using granular empirical evidence, this project will investigate the role of financial factors in firms' exit decisions, and whether the relevance of these factors fluctuates with the business cycle. The hypothesis is that firm exit in normal times is driven by the long-run sustainability of business operations (solvency), but that short-term restrictions in access to credit markets (illiquidity), play a sizable role during downturns. Accordingly, the researchers will study the sensitivity of firm exit to financial health, controlling for other firm characteristics, as a function of the business cycle."
