abstract: "This project will use the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Census of Manufactures (CMF), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) the Ownership Change Dataset (OCD), and the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SSL-NA) to study the effects of mergers and acquisitions on firm performance in the poultry processing industry (NAICS code 311615).  The research will focus on poultry (broiler and turkeys) processing because this industry possesses two distinct characteristics that make its study interesting and valuable. First, the poultry industry represents an entirely vertically integrated chain where the production of live birds is contracted out to independent farmers. Secondly, in the last 10 years, the industry has experienced a significant increase in industry concentration, mainly through mergers and acquisitions.  The proposed research will examine the motivations of firms in this industry to internally incorporate transactions previously taking place in the marketplace."
