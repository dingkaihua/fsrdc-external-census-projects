abstract: "Employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is the backbone of coverage and health care in the United States. Yet, there has been a substantial decline in employers offering health insurance, especially among small businesses, over the past 20 years. These small businesses occupy an especially important position in the employment of racial/ethnic minorities, and thus lower rates of ESI provision for small businesses may help explain the lower rates of health coverage among disadvantaged groups. However, not all small businesses fail to provide ESI, and researchers have failed to examine the potential impacts of business owner and community demographics, which may play an important role in explaining ESI coverage. By combining data from the Survey of Business Owners, Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, and Annual Business Survey, we are able to examine ESI provision among small businesses by employer race/ethnicity, employer nativity, and the race/ethnic composition of the surrounding geographic area.
