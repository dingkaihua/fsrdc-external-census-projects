abstract: "This project will study capital reallocation and the liquidity of real assets. Using COMPUSTAT data, we have shown that the amount of capital reallocation is procyclical. In contrast the benefits to capital reallocation appear countercyclical. We find that a counter cyclical process for capital illiquidity can reconcile these series and discuss possible sources of this illiquidity. Our project will build on and extend our previous work. We propose to study the cyclical properties of capital reallocation and capital illiquidity, understand the nature of capital illiquidity, understand the role of used capital markets in firm dynamics, and construct stylized facts describing firm heterogeneity including the cyclical properties of dispersion in productivity, capacity utilization and investment opportunities across firms. This research project on measuring capital reallocation has as its predominant purpose (I) to further the understanding and improve the quality of the data, (ii) to improve the methodology for measurement, and (iii) to prepare estimates of characteristics of the population. By measuring capital at the establishment or firm level and the reallocation of capital (i.e., sale or purchases of capital) across establishments or firms and by comparing the findings from the non-public data to our findings using COMPUSTAT data, the project will further the understanding of the quality of the data and improve the quality of the data. In addition, by documenting what can be learned from the existing data from the ASM/CM and ACES about the reallocation of capital, the project should lead to new or improved methodology to collect data to measure capital and its redeployment in different use. The benefits should compare to the productive interaction between the measurement of labor reallocation by Davis, Haltiwanger and coauthors and the data collection by the Bureau of the Census. The project will result in estimates of population and characteristics of population such as an aggregate capital reallocation series and documentation of its cyclical properties. Furthermore, the project will prepare estimates of dispersion measures of productivity across firms as well as the dynamics of heterogeneity across firms, an important feature of the microdata which has not been sufficiently studied."
