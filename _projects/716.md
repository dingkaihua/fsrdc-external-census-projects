abstract: "This study investigates the determinants of private pension plan conversions from traditional defined benefit plans to hybrid cash balance plans during the 1990s. It examines whether there are systematic differences in the types of firms and plans that converted. It also examines the endogenous relaÂ­tionship between the likelihood of conversion (on pension plan type, in general) and employee turnover. The project utilizes data from several sources for this analysis. Information on pension plan characteristics comes from the annual 5500 forms which most private sector firms file each year in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). From the PBGC also comes information on plan terminations. These data are linked to the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, which provide information about establishment-level characteristics of the workforce. Firm level data from Compustat provide several important firm-level characteristics. The research intends to improve the link between the Form 5500 data and the Business Register. It will also compare data from the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Surveys to Form 5500 data in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset in studying firm human resource policies. It will also establish evidence on the determinants of employer provided pension plan policy changes and provide estimates of population characteristics relating to changes in employer provided pension plan coverage rates."
