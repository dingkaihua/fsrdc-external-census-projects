abstract: "Mothers' employment in jobs with nonstandard schedules has been associated with adverse child cognitive and academic outcomes. A key pathway via which these associations are hypothesized to operate is children's participation in early care and education. Working during nonstandard times is expected to limit the use of formal early care and education (ECE) programs because the times during which parents need care are mismatched with these programs' weekday, daytime schedules. Formal ECE tends to be higher-quality than care provided in home-based settings and has been associated with more positive child cognitive and academic skills. Although prior correlational studies find an association between mothers' work schedules and children's participation in formal ECE, two recent studies suggest that mothers' nonstandard schedules are not necessarily associated with a lower likelihood of using formal ECE, depending on child age and family structure. Using nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the purpose of this study is to examine trends in children's participation in ECE programs from 1996 to 2020 and estimate associations between mothers' work schedules and children's ECE participation, including examining heterogeneity in these associations by child age, family demographic characteristics, and county-level characteristics. Further, this study will use county-level labor market and economic indicators as instruments for mothers' work hours and schedules to provide evidence of causal associations between mothers' work schedules and children's ECE participation."
