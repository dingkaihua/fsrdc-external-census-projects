abstract: "We propose to examine the impact of minimum quality standards on the supply side of the child care market, using a unique panel data set merged from the Census of Services Industries (1987-1997, establishments with payroll), state regulation Data (1987-1996), and accreditation data (1986-1997) from National Association of Education for Young Children (NAEYC). The welfare effect of minimum quality standards is theoretically controversial and empirically poorly documented due to data limitations. The panel nature of this data set will make this study able to control state fixed effects and time fixed effects, in order to better answer: Will more stringent minimum quality standards reduce supply in the child care market? Will more stringent standards force more firms to exit the market? Will more stringent standards motivate firms to pursue higher quality via accreditation? This study will be the first in the field in the sense that it uses panel data to study the supply side of a market subject to minimum quality standards. This proposal will benefit the Census Bureau by incorporating external sources of data into the Census data, corroborating the Census data, providing estimates of the child care industry, and understanding industry dynamics."
