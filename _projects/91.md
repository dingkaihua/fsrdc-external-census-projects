abstract: "This proposal examines the impact of corporate restructuring on management of environmental and workplace risks and the determinants of compliance with environmental regulations.  Three industries are involved - paper, oil, and steel.  Both projects require good data on pollution abatement costs, productivity, and plant-firm ownership links.  We'll be linking in outside data on ownership, compliance, enforcement, and environmental performance, checking for consistency with Census data and over time.  The results will include estimates of econometric models for academic publication, and reports to Census on data quality issues.  "
