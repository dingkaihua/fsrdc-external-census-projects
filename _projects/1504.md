abstract: "This project analyzes the effects of production subsidies on local and aggregate economic development outcomes. Exploiting a seven-year $800 million subsidy lottery in California's film industry that sorted hundreds of establishments across cities of varying industrial concentration in film, the project studies how production incentives affect establishment location decisions and their associated impact on local wages, employment, municipal revenue, and productivity. Placing these estimates of subsidy benefits in a spatial equilibrium framework, the second part of this study examines the cost-side of attracting employers with local incentives by characterizing the welfare effects of fiscal competition between municipalities. Finally, the project leverages a policy change in 2014 that reformed the subsidy allocation mechanism from a lottery system to a "jobs-impact" ranking formula, providing an ideal laboratory for examining whether subsidy lotteries generate misallocation costs, compared to deliberate employment-based allocation mechanisms."
