abstract: "The proposed project is a follow-on to an earlier CES project and consists of two extensions. The first regards the link between market segmentation and price dispersion. This research seeks to utilize the establishment-level Products and Materials Files from the Census of Manufactures (CM) to see if the connection between output substitutability and between-plant productivity differences documented in the earlier project also manifests itself in pricing decisions. The project will characterize if and by how much prices systematically vary across markets within an industry, which could have important sampling frame implications. Furthermore, because of its extensive use of the CM Products and Materials Files, the research is intended to improve the quality and usefulness of this highly detailed but underemployed data. These data suffer from the large amount of imputations within them, which are not always separately identified as such. The project will, for the industries it studies, facilitate comparisons between establishments with and without imputed data to check if and how those plants are systematically different, offering guidance regarding the reliability of the numbers. The second proposed extension applies to the estimation of establishment-level productivity levels. An important product of the earlier project was a data set of local demand-shifting instruments that could be used for, among other things, productivity estimation. Many interesting issues remain with respect to identification of technology parameters with microdata, such as differing rates of return to inputs and input mix selection based upon these differences, plant technology choice and local input markets, and the link between productivity and input choice. The proposed project will explore such issues in a theoretical framework of selection and treatment that has been well developed in the labor literature, but largely unused in productivity research. I plan to obtain measures of the distribution of establishment technologies within industries. These will be linked to other industry-level observables in order to find patterns between technology choice and input and output market structures. (These industry-level technology distribution measures could possibly be made available to other researchers.) It is also expected that this work will identify data that is not presently collected but would be useful for correctly measuring productivity and understanding its dynamics."
