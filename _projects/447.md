abstract: "The purpose of this proposal is to improve the accuracy and quality of the ongoing Survey of Business Owners by helping distinguish true entrepreneurial ventures from individuals with small amounts of supplemental income and by addressing some of the difficulties arising from follow-up surveys of small firms that have gone out of business. It will do this by studying the economic determinants of the survival and operation of legitimate entrepreneurial ventures. The project will use information from the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) survey on the health and operation of businesses in 1992 and 1994 further matched to the establishment lists (SSEL) and, where possible, the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the future release of the Survey of Business Owners (SBO) to examine the survival and operation of entrepreneurs. It will look at two basic areas. The first is determining what economic factors influence the probability of survival for entrepreneurial firms. This will focus particularly on local credit conditions and local economic growth as well as on the influence of direct government support to entrepreneurs at the state and local level. The determinants of small firm survival are directly tied to the difficulties of follow-up activity required by the Census Bureau. The second is examining the impact of taxes (and some regulations) on the operation and offerings of the entrepreneurial firms. This will focus specifically on the subjects of how marginal income tax rates affect the hours that entrepreneurs choose to work on their businesses, how much income they report and the likelihood of hiring employees, as well as the role that they play on the likelihood that small businesses offer health insurance, pension plans, or medical leave to their workers, and to the probability that they operate the business out of the owner's home. Each of these subjects is correlated with a business being a true entrepreneurial venture (people with small amounts of supplemental income are unlikely to work long hours on the job, hire employees, offer health, pension or family leave, or move their businesses out of the home). The CBO, with its detailed micro level observations and ability to follow individuals across time even beyond the time frame of the survey by matching to the SSEL and the LBD, gives a unique opportunity to answer such questions. While the CBO is a sample of people with Schedule C income (as well as some partnerships), it avoids the typical problems of using tax return data by providing extensive information about the characteristics of the business owner, their background, and the like. This makes it the ideal basis for such a project."
