abstract: "This project examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on individual firms and market structure. The researchers will develop firm-level measures of AI intensity using self-provided job posting data and the Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey, to determine the effect of AI on firm occupation composition and performance. We investigate the factors that influence firm AI adoption decisions, as well as the forces that shape AI's impact on overall market concentration. Among the forces at work are fixed adoption costs, economies of scale, and data feedback loops. Additionally, the distributive effects of AI across different types of
firms will be explored."
