abstract: "In the late 1980s, a series of legal rulings favorable to tribes and the subsequent passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 legalized gaming operations on reservations in many states. Today, there are over 310 gaming operations run by more than 200 of the nations’ 556 federally recognized tribes. Of these operations, about 220 are “Las Vegas” style casinos with slot machines and/or table games. By 1999, about half of tribal members in the lower 48 states are in tribes that run a casino-style gaming operation. By 2000, Indian-owned gaming operations generated about $10 billion in revenues, about one-sixth of all revenues generated by legal gaming in this country. Given the large number of tribes that have embraced casino gaming as an economic development program, it is worth considering whether Indians on reservations have benefitted from these operations. As the legal and legislative controversies surrounding tribal-owned gaming persist, the interest in this question continues to grow. The authors of this proposal are currently involved in the first nationwide evaluation of the social and economic impact of Native American-owned gaming operations on tribes and their surrounding communities. Evans and Topoleski find that four years after tribes open casinos, employment increases by 26 percent, and tribal population increases by about 12 percent, resulting in an increase in employment to population ratios of five percentage points or about 12 percent. These benefits are not without costs. Their results indicate that although casinos improve aggregate employment in the counties where they are located, employment falls in surrounding counties. They also show that bankruptcy and crime rates increase in counties after a tribal-owned casino opens. The investigators of this proposal outline a research program that uses restricted-use data from the 1990 and 2000 Census long-form samples to examine the impact of gambling on people who live on or near reservations. The long-form samples are sent to one in six households and contain a wealth of social, demographic, and economic information about households and their members. Public use versions of this data do not contain enough geographic detail to place households in particular tribes or on reservations, but detailed geographic data are available on restricted-use versions of the data set. Most of the tribal-owned gaming operations opened during the 1990s so the dates of the Census are fortuitous. One can examine the impact of a new casino by looking at changing economic outcomes for people that lived on or near reservations before and after the casino opened and compare these to changes for Census respondents whose tribes did not adopt gaming."
