abstract: "This project investigates how firms manage their liquid assets. The Census Bureau’s Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) provides information on the types and amount of firms’ liquid assets, including cash, deposits, commercial paper, government securities, and other short-term financial investments. The project also uses Compustat, Federal Reserve Economic Data, and the Federal Reserve Board’s Commercial Paper Statistical Release, to examine whether and how much the allocation among different liquid assets is explained by various firm characteristics, such as firm size, leverage, and financial constraints. The project also investigates whether firms holding more excess cash are likely to invest more in relatively risky liquid assets such as commercial paper and government securities. Finally, the project investigates whether the liquid asset composition is affected by the riskiness and liquidity of individual liquid assets."
