abstract: "Medicare Savings Programs (MSP) provide financial assistance to participants for Medicare premiums and, in some cases, required cost sharing for medical services covered by Medicare. However, the rate of participation in these programs, as well as the individual characteristics associated with participation, is not well understood. This is in part because household surveys administered by the Census Bureau and other entities do not collect information on MSP participation, and administrative sources that identify MSP enrollment clearly exclude those eligible but not enrolled. This research attempts to fill this gap in data collection by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked with administrative data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The administrative data will serve as the means to identify MSP enrollees among SIPP respondents, while the SIPP will identify the MSP eligible population using survey data on income, assets, and state of residence. Using these linked data, this work will study participation in the MSP programs and factors that influence participation."
