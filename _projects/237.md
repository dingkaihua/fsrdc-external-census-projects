abstract: "We propose to study the impact of different forms of corporate restructuring on the labor market decisions, R&D activities, capital structure, and productivity of the firm and its establishments. We specifically consider spin-offs and equity carve-outs. Recently, the theoretical literature has argued that spin-offs and carve-outs have a disciplining effect on firm management. This literature has shown that restructuring increases the probability of a takeover of firms undergoing spin-offs and carve-outs by rival firms with better management ability, thus disciplining management and lowering managerial discretion. If managerial discretion decreases in this manner, we expect that the labor market decisions and R&D activities of the firm would be adversely affected following such restructuring. Establishments undergoing such restructuring will have poor productivity prior to the restructuring, with productivity improving after restructuring. This study proposes to test these hypotheses by comparing wages, employment, productivity, R&D activities, and capital structure of these establishments both before and after the restructuring to a control group of establishments that have not undergone such restructuring. Moreover we attempt to distinguish between the effects of such corporate restructuring on production and non-production workers. Our proposed study directly benefits the Census Bureauâ€™s data by precisely identifying two types of corporate restructuring events, namely spin-offs and equity carveouts. We propose to identify all establishments of manufacturing firms, which had a spin-off or a carveout, by linking up the LRD and OCD with other databases, such as CRSP, Compustat, and SDC, which provide information on such restructuring events. This will help in correctly identifying the type of ownership change and thus enhance the quality of the LRD data. Our study will also help in better identifying establishments over time in a way that correctly treats the transfer of ownership and control. By linking up the SDC to the LRD, our study will help to remove possible inconsistencies related to ownership changes of establishments in the LRD data. The aim of our analysis is to provide a complete picture of the effects of corporate restructuring on the productivity of a firm, and on the employment and wages of the entire hierarchy of the firm: from executives, and central office employees, to both white and blue-collar plant level employees."
