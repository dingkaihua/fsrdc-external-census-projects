abstract: "In this project, we study the effects of common ownership, the extent to which different firms share common owners, on employees at the establishment level. Common ownership has been increasing in the U.S. in the past four decades, and this phenomenon raised the alarm that a small number of giant asset managers could effectively control most large, publicly traded firms in the near future. Increased common ownership could increase firms' employer market power, which in turn could contribute to the wage stagnation since the 1970s. Although this argument is theoretically appealing, little is known about whether and how common ownership affects employees and capital investment in reality. To achieve our goal, we merge microdata in the Census, for example, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Census of Manufactures (CMF), and Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), with institutional ownership data from SEC Form 13F. In addition to canonical panel regressions, we further use a firm's addition to the S&P 500 index as a shock to the common ownership of its competitors in local labor markets and use a matched difference-in-differences analysis to identify causal impacts of common ownership. We expect that an increase in common ownership would lead to a decrease in employee earnings conditional on labor productivity. Our project contributes to the literature by being the first to document common ownership effects on employees."
