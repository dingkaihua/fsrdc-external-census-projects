abstract: "This project uses internal National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data from 1996-2014 that include geographic codes (i.e., zip codes, census tracts, and counties), along with NCVS language files from 2007-2014 that include the interview language for respondents. While the publicly-available NCVS data provide a rich set of indicators, including the racial and ethnic identity of respondents in some detail, no additional items are available that might further illuminate potentially important nuances in experiences with crime or the police among ethnic minorities who differ on levels of acculturation to American society. Linking these data to the core internal NCVS files would yield valuable insights, both for the nature and quality of data collected in non-English interviews, and for scientific understanding of how language proficiency may shape victimization risk and decisions to notify the police.
