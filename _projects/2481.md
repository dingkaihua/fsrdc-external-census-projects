abstract: "This research project examines the relationship between changes in the US immigrant population and the country's urban housing stock.  Using the American Housing Survey, the American Community Survey, and the Decennial Census, I estimate the demands for urban housing across immigrant groups, comparing them to demands by the larger US population.  The goal of the study is to relate potentially distinct housing demands by immigrants to changes in the physical structure of US urban areas."
