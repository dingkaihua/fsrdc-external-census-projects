abstract: "This project will use the Economic Censuses (EC), the Business R&D Surveys (SIRD, BRDIS and the ABS), the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD), and the Revenue-Enhanced Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to provide new series that shed light on two questions.   First, what are the sources of innovation?  What is the role of creative destruction, innovation on a firm's own products, and creation of new products?  How important is access to foreign markets for each type of innovation?  Second, what are the effects of top firm concentration on innovation, aggregate growth, and the spatial distribution of economic activity?

This project builds upon the work the researchers completed in their previous Census RDC projects.  In these projects, the researchers tackled two questions.  First, how do we measure the efficiency of resource allocation across firms for a given distribution of underlying firm productivity?  Second, what are the mechanisms behind the changes in the distribution of firm productivity over time?  How much of the growth in firm productivity takes the form of creative destruction, innovation on the firm's own products, and the creation of brand new products?  

In the current proposal, the researchers plan to address two questions.  First, the researchers will address three limitations of the previous census project.  In the previous project, the researchers inferred the contribution of each type of innovation from the distribution of job flows.  The researchers did not directly observe each type of innovation, but rather inferred the frequency of each type of innovation from the distribution of job creation and job destruction.  The researchers also assumed that the size of quality improvements was the same for creative destruction and own innovation.  A third limitation was that the researchers assumed innovations only built on the products owned by domestic firms.  In the proposed research project, the researchers will directly measure the frequency and improvement in quality from each type of innovation based on the business R&D surveys (ABS-BRDIS-SIRD).  In addition, the researchers will measure the contribution of access to foreign markets to innovation by merging the LFTTD with the LBD and EC.

A second objective of this research proposal is to measure the effect of the growing concentration of sales at top firms.  The researchers believe that growing firm concentration could be the consequence of new technologies that enable top firms to expand.  The researchers plan to examine this hypothesis by measuring the following moments.  First, the researchers will decompose the growth of top firms in an industry into the contribution of expansion into new product lines or markets.  Second, the researchers will measure industry productivity growth in sectors where top firm concentration has increased.  Third, the researchers will measure changes in the share of payments to labor in industry sales, and their correlation with the change in the market share of top firms in the sector.  Fourth, the researchers will measure changes in the market share of top national firms in local markets (defined as an MSA or a county), and the extent of local labor productivity growth in each local market.  Finally, the researchers will examine the correlation of job destruction with the change in the market share of top national firms in the sector. 
           	
These statistics will allow the researchers to measure the empirical importance of different mechanisms of innovation, the importance of exports in innovation, and the economic effects of the growing concentration of top firms."
