abstract: "With the impending replacement of the decennial long form with the  American Community Survey  (ACS), there are potential concerns related to  using the new ACS data specifically for travel demand modeling and forecasting.  Although ACS differs from the decennial long form in several significant ways,  one of the most prominent is that five years of surveying will used to be used  to obtain an equivalent CTPP sample for reporting on small geographic units  such as Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) or census tracts. This project specifically  examines the transportation implications of workplace geo-coding at geographic  units of evaluation, such as the TAZ. In addition, recommendations for improving  and expediting workplace geo-coding and maintaining reference files will be  developed."
