abstract: "Although it has been well documented that a substantial portion of all crime experienced by citizens in the U.S. is not reported to the police, very few studies have systematically examined whether residents of certain types of communities are more, or less, likely to report crime victimizations to the police. This issue has not been addressed extensively largely because the data needed to do so—data on victims of crime and on the communities in which they reside—traditionally have not been available to researchers. If approved by the Census Bureau, the proposed research will use data from the 1995-2001 Area-Identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), linked with data from the Sample Survey of Law Enforcement Agencies (SSLEA), the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, and census data on tracts and places to investigate the effects of several characteristics of communities on the likelihood of police notification by crime victims. The community characteristics considered will include neighborhood features such as socioeconomic disadvantage, minority concentration, immigrant concentration, and residential instability, and place-level indicators such as the degree of local police involvement in community policing activities and the racial composition of the local police agency. The proposed research contributes significantly to the literature on victim crime reporting, and the analyses have important implications for macro-level research and theory tests which often assume little or no systematic variation in crime reporting across communities. In addition, the research will benefit the Census Bureau by adding contextual data to the NCVS, evaluating and improving the usefulness of the NCVS, using methodologies (e.g., survey regression techniques, multilevel modeling) that will enhance understanding of these data, and highlighting the value of the NCVS for cutting-edge theoretical and relevant research."
