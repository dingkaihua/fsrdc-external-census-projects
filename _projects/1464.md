abstract: "This project will use Current Population Survey (CPS) November Voting and Registration Supplements, covering 1994-2014 biennially, to estimate the impacts of age-eligibility around age 18 on short- and long-term voting behaviors using a regression discontinuity (RD) research design to estimate causal effects. Second, the researchers will examine interactions between age eligibility and other state characteristics that lower/raise the “costs” of voting. This design will allow a fuller account of the factors that distinguish the initiation into voting and the inertia of voting behaviors and whether these patterns differ across cohorts or elections. "
