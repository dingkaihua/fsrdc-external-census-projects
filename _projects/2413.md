abstract: "While recent research has studied the impacts of the Great Recession on the wages and employment of young adults, less is known about how their parents protected them from the economic crash. By linking young adults in the American Community Survey to themselves in the Decennial Census to obtain their parental information, we intend to investigate how the impact of the Great Recession on the earnings, migration, and educational attainment of youth differed based on the socioeconomic status of their parents. We expect to find substantial heterogeneity within young adults, with the children of wealthier parents being more likely to take protective actions such as delaying labor force entry via the pursuit of higher education and leaving areas that were impacted worse by the Great Recession, while the children of disadvantaged parents being less so. These asymmetric responses and the flight of talented youth from areas adversely affected by the Great Recession may in turn be important in explaining the stark differences in post-recession recoveries observed between urban and rural locations in the United States."
