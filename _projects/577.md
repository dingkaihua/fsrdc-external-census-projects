abstract: "We propose to analyze the effects of health insurance benefit costs on employer demand for part-time employees, availability of retiree health insurance bene-fits, and the effects of unionization on health benefit offers and cost sharing arrangements by employers. To address these issues, we propose to use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) List Sample matched with the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and supplemental economic data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Area Resource File.   This project will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by contributing to the understanding of the quality of the data collected in the MEPS-IC by comparing variables reported by establishments and firms in MEPS-IC and the LBD (e.g., tenure/age of firm). This project will also look for variability in reporting by establishments of the same firm and will derive methods to address inconsistencies. In addition, this project will benefit the Census Bureau by reporting estimates on the effects of rising health insurance on labor demand."
