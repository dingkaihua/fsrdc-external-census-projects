abstract: "This study will examine the spatial influences on ethnic labor market segmentation, viz. how the locations of workers’ residences and workplaces influence the emergence of ethnic niche occupations. It argues that human and social capital is built through particular spatial arrangements, and that residential and workplace locations can act to inhibit occupational choices. The study will use the confidential Census data derived from the Decennial Long Form 2000 to conduct a case study of Chinese in the San Francisco CMSA. The study has three objectives: (i) to examine the ethnic segmentation of San Francisco’s labor market and identify Chinese niche sectors; (ii) to identify Chinese residential and workplace concentrations, and examine the social and economic characteristics of these concentrations; and (iii) to evaluate how the geography of home and work influences the emergence of Chinese occupational niches. This project will contribute to the Census Bureau by improving the accuracy and reducing the costs of conducting the census. Three specific contributions can be mentioned. First, by identifying the many Chinese enclaves and examining the unique social and economic characteristics of each, the study will aid the preparation of estimates and characteristics of the Chinese population and minimize the problems of missed and inaccurately represented subpopulations during sampling. Second, this study will help the Census Bureau to design and appropriately target bilingual forms, provide telephone assistance and the telephone self-response options. By identifying and mapping both the residential locations and workplace locations of workers at census tract level, this study can facilitate the success of follow-up surveys and help reduce under/over counts. Finally, this study will help the Census Bureau in the development of a pilot study to over-sample the Asian population for Census 2010. For example, the results can be used to assess whether better estimates are to be gained from oversampling areas with high concentrations of the target (Chinese) population, or by over-sampling across a larger geographic area, albeit with smaller concentrations of the target population. The geographic patterns of Chinese concentrations can be correlated with patterns and rates of mail response to Census questionnaires to assess response rates. These benefits will help further the recommendations made by the Census Advisory Committee on the Asian Populations made as a result of the meeting on May 1, 2002."
