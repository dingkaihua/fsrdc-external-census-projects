abstract: "China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 has led to a surge in U.S. imports from China and a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in industries affected by Chinese import competition. While the implications of this “China Shock” for the U.S. manufacturing sector are well documented, little is known about how U.S. firms—the entities that own plants and employ workers—adjust to the China Shock. Do firms reallocate resources away from affected plants and toward plants in less affected industries? Or do they shift resources towards affected plants, allowing them to compete more effectively against Chinese imports? And what explains the direction and magnitude of the resource reallocation? This research will address these questions by using establishment-level microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database, Census of Manufactures, and Annual Survey of Manufactures, and worker-level data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program."
