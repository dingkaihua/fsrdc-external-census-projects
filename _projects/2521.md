abstract: "We seek to better understand the dynamics of supply chains of meat products evolving over time, their vulnerability to unexpected supply and demand shocks, and potential policy and strategies for long term sustainability. We will construct supply chain networks (SCNs) for selected meat products, e.g., beef, pork, poultry, and seafood, using 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, if and when available 2017 and 2022 Commodity Flow Survey data. We will then analyze characteristics of the SCNs and their changes over time, develop an economic model to understand the economics of supply chain formation, and simulate how meat supply chains are affected by spatial spread of disease or market crises under alternative scenarios. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected almost every aspect of food supply chain, from farm gate to food processing/manufacturing plant through to grocery store. The crisis is expected to have a large impact on and reshape the food sectors in long-lasting ways. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the underlying structure and vulnerability of food supply chains as well as the economics of supply chain formation in order to quantify the consequences of the on-going crisis, and of similar crises, and to design sound policy responses."
