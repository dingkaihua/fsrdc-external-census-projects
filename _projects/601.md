abstract: "This project will provide detailed descriptions of the availability of private schools to U.S. households and how this varies by geography and household characteristics. It also estimates the sensitivity of households to tuition prices when choosing a school for their children. Detailed geographic identifiers are used to link each household in the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses and the American Community Survey (ACS) to data on private schools compiled from public sources and surveys. Data on private school tuition prices along with data on school attendance in the censuses and ACS are used to estimate the sensitivity of private school attendance to price."
