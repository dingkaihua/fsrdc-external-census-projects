abstract: "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housed millions of people in the US since 1965, offering a critical piece of stability and offsetting the largest share of monthly expenses for these families. This paper studies the effect of access to affordable housing through HUD on employment, household structure, criminal activity, and mortality. To do so, we leverage three natural experiments, including the 1997 one-strike policy, openings and closing along with distance of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), and local waitlists along with restricted microdata through the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs). Our study will add to the existing literature by considering how HUD benefits affect short- to medium-term labor market outcomes, household structure, criminal justice contact, and mortality for adults and whether effects vary across racial and gender groups. We will also compare our results to the effects of other public programs using county-level rollouts in the later 1960s and 1970s, as a measure of increased access to non-housing subsidies. The project requires access to restricted microdata for two main reasons. First, public data does not allow for linking of people across HUD, labor market data, mortality data, and criminal justice datasets at the individual level to examine impacts of access to affordable housing. Second, public data does not allow for the linking of people within households to observe changes in household structure and the spillovers of HUD assistance to other members of the household on the listed socioeconomic outcomes. This project will use the Census Numident, Decennial and American Community Surveys, CJARS, LEHD, and the HUD Longitudinal Research file as well as the HUD PIC and TRACS enrollment files.
