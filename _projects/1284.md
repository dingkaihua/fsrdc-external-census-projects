abstract: "This project will link location of birth to the 2000 Decennial Census long form and the American Community Survey (ACS) to create and validate a new variable, location of birth, for each ACS or long-form respondent. This project will then prepare estimates of the long run determinants of social, demographic, and economic characteristics and processes, including migration, education, labor-force outcomes, wages, poverty rates, disability status, public assistance receipt, childbearing, marriage and divorce, long-term mobility, and household composition. The researchers will use various policy and natural experiments that occurred between 1964 and 1980 on individuals born during that period and who are observed as adults in the 2000 Census and the 1996-2011 ACS."
