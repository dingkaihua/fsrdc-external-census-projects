abstract: "How do firms' worker characteristics and engagement in international markets affect each other? Aimed at answering this question, our proposed project will leverage a new method developed by the researchers apportioning firm-level exports in the LFTTD to establishments belonging to the firm in the LBD. By further connecting these establishments with their workers in the LEHD, we will obtain a direct mapping between an establishment's exports and its workers. These links will help us understand the nexus between trade and immigration, how engagement in international trade mediates how firms respond to fiscal stimulus, and how exposure to international markets affects wage inequality."
