abstract: "This project aims to study the intersection of productivity growth and market power, in an economy-wide context. We will consider how changes in market power and consumer demand are related to the evolution of prices, productivity, markups, and costs. Our main research questions are: 1. What is the establishment-level productivity and the degree of price dispersion across various sectors and locations in the U.S. economy? 2. How much have markups risen in various sectors of the U.S. economy over the past several decades? 3. Does controlling for changing markups, particularly establishment-level price changes, significantly change the measured productivity growth both at the sector-level and across industries? 
To answer these questions, we will jointly estimate a flexible structural model of consumer demand and the production technology used in each 6-digit NAICS sector, relying on data observed in standard plant-level datasets. Applying these methods to the detailed data from the Census Bureau, we will study how the evolution of productivity and market power has occurred in different industries, geographies, and in aggregate. In particular, we will examine and pay special attention to non-manufacturing sectors as they account for the majority of the economy. "
