abstract: "This project will study firms' internal capital markets by examining companies' responses to divisional cash shocks. Prior literature documents various frictions affecting the allocation of assets within a firm, such as regulatory requirements or agency costs. As a result, whether, to what extent, and where a cash flow shock will be spent by a firm is an open empirical question. Our "shocks" to capital flows are subsidies awarded to firms by regional (e.g., state, county, or city) governments, which occur frequently over our sample period. We consider two main types of subsidies - cash grants and regional tax exemptions - that either decrease a firm's operating costs for a certain period of time (in the case of regional tax exemptions) or increase a firm's available capital by providing a "windfall" (in the case of cash grants) in the specific subsidizing jurisdiction. Our dataset consists of a large sample of approximately 50,000 tax subsidies and cash grants awarded to over 2,000 companies since 2004. Additionally, we will use the Economic Census, the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES), and other Census datasets. Our tests provide insight into the extent to which firms efficiently redeploy their assets and the potentially different effects of the cash flow shocks provided by the two different types of subsidies we consider. We also intend to show how frictions, such as regulatory restrictions and agency costs, affect firms' internal asset allocations. Finally, we assess regional implications of cash flow shocks."
