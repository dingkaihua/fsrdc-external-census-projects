abstract: "Modern labor markets are shaped by a concurrence of several strong secular trends -- a drastic increase in wage inequality since the 1980s, a shifting tenure and job-churn distribution, the decline of manufacturing jobs, and the further integration of women and racial minorities into the traditional labor market. In this project, we employ LEHD and Census demographic surveys to provide a more complete picture of how each of these trends plays into one another. By analyzing the effects of shifting trends in private- and public-sector employment across industries by age, gender, race, education, and occupation, using linked demographic data, we will uncover 1) how compositional changes in the economy effect the changing rate of job churn and tenure, 2) whether between-firm competition for highly qualified workers exacerbates gender and racial inequalities, and 3) how these results vary across the private and public sectors."
