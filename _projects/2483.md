abstract: "The project seeks to understand how monetary shocks affects different firms' employment differently. Specifically, are younger and smaller firms more responsive to monetary shocks? There is a strand of literature that measures the effect of monetary shocks on the aggregate economic activity including employment. However, little is known about the disproportionate effect of monetary shocks on the employment of different firm groups. This project aims at providing new evidence on the distributional effect of monetary shocks on firm dynamics. It intends to examine heterogeneous responses of firms to monetary shocks and the propagation mechanism of monetary shocks to employment through financial frictions. It is important because the effective usage of monetary tools to promote maximum employment depends on the understanding of monetary transmission to household spending, business investment, production, employment, and inflation in the United States. The main challenge to answer the research question above is the lack of firm-level data with comprehensive coverage and we utilize restricted micro data from the Census Bureau to overcome this challenge."
