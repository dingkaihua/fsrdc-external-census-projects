abstract: "The disparity between persons enrolled in U.S. federal poverty programs and persons who respond to U.S. Census Bureau surveys saying they are enrolled appears to be systemic across programs. This research will analyze the child care subsidy (CCS) take-up decision and a range of employment and welfare outcomes among all low-income families in Illinois, Maryland, and Texas. This project will improve the Census Bureau’s understanding of who uses the child care subsidy and how the subsidy aids different groups of low-income families in their quest for economic independence. The groups we distinguish are those who are currently receiving cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, those who have recently left TANF, and those who have had no recent contact with the TANF program (frequently referred to as the working poor).  This proposed research will further benefit the Census Bureau’s data programs by prototyping an eligibility microsimulation model for a specific federal poverty program (the Child Care and Development Fund in this case) that can be tailored for other programs. Since federal poverty programs are dependent on current surveys for program administration and program size estimates, the quality of the surveys is of great interest to the Census Bureau as well as to federal poverty programs. The American Community Survey, while not providing significant detail on program utilization, has a large sample size, thus affording an opportunity to use it in concert with other smaller more detailed surveys, like the CPS and SIPP, to improve eligibility modeling. The primary dataset to be used for analysis, the Social Services Analysis File (SSAF), is an output of an internal Census Bureau project (TANF/Child Care Subsidy Research)."
