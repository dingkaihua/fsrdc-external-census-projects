abstract: "Understanding which factors attract households to particular neighborhoods provides a critical lens into neighborhood change. Previous research has found that the neighborhood choices of in-moving households are important drivers of neighborhood change. We still know very little about what neighborhood factors drive these location decisions. This research project explores whether the quality of the zoned public school, the crime rate, and/or the racial composition of a neighborhood differentially attract particular types of households to that neighborhood. Four key dimensions of households – their tenure, income, race, and presence of children – provide the focus for this research.  Using the internal versions of the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, and the American Housing Survey, along with rich external datasets describing neighborhood characteristics, this project will overcome existing data limitations that have prevented researchers from gaining insight into how neighborhood quality influences household residential choices. These detailed microdata will be employed to estimate separately which neighborhood factors attract households to particular neighborhoods and then model household neighborhood choice, incorporating information on previous residence to improve the specification.  Part of this project will conduct an in-depth exploration of item response rates in each of the different surveys used in order to gain a sense of the quality of the data on previous residence. It will take advantage of the changes in the ways in which the question is asked to see how changing the phrasing of the previous residence variable influences item response rates. We will also examine how differences in survey administration influence item response rates. "
