abstract: "The proposed project seeks to explore how family member criminal justice involvement and incarceration - either parental or sibling - influences the family and neighborhood contexts in which contemporary children live, their families' well-being, and their early adulthood outcomes. Prior research has found multiple negative associations between parental incarceration and children's well-being, extending well into young adulthood. However, research has been limited by small samples of children who have experienced parental incarceration within larger studies, and less attention has been paid to the consequences of a family member's conviction (without incarceration) or the influence of neighborhood context. This project will create new population estimates that fall in three broad research areas: 1) How children's exposure to household members' criminal justice contact (CJC) has varied over neighborhood and family context and time; 2) how children's exposure to familial CJC is associated with children's immediate household-level context, including levels of poverty and food insecurity; and 3) how children's exposure to familial CJC effects their outcomes in young adulthood, including educational attainment, economic mobility, and their own involvement in criminal justice systems."
