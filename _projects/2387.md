abstract: "Longer lives, the shift to defined contribution (DC) plans, and lower Social Security replacement rates mean Americans need to work longer to secure an adequate retirement. This project analyzes the ability of older workers to find employment in an environment where longer careers are likely to be necessary but where increasing firm concentration and a lack of demand from employers threaten their ability to do so. First, the project examines the relationship between employer concentration and labor force participation (LFP) for workers at various ages. To establish the mechanisms involved in this association, the project will test for heterogeneity in the correlation of concentration and LFP by two dimensions: education and unionization.  In both cases, the effect of concentration is expected to be smaller for workers with more bargaining power, such as the more educated and the unionized. Second, the project explores whether older workers are good for firms' productivity and profitability. The project will estimate the firm-level correlation of the share of workers over age 55 and the productivity of the firm, as measured by revenue per worker, the ratio of revenue to wages, and for the manufacturing sector total factor productivity and whether production targets were met.  The project will estimate the share of workers over age 55 by commuting zone (CZ), and focusing on the manufacturing sector will estimate the correlation of productivity, with the share of workers over age 55 instrumented by the share of the firm's CZ over age 55."
