abstract: "Census Bureau data are the primary source of information for residential segregation studies in the United States, but thus far researchers have been limited to studying aggregate level outcomes without being able to trace them back to the micro level social processes that drive these aggregate level patterns. Using new segregation measures which address and rectify methodological issues that have limited past research, this research will achieve these goals by demonstrating how it is now possible to study residential segregation at the micro and macro levels and how macro-level segregation is driven by micro-level social processes. In particular, this research will investigate the residential patterns of Latinos using new methodological techniques that will increase understandings of how individual social characteristics relate to residential outcomes for individuals, and how those outcomes in turn can be aggregated to generate measures of segregation at the city level. This project will also address the uncertainty of using the smaller American Community Survey samples for conducting in-depth analyses of residential segregation â€“ analyses that could have once been explored using the data from the (now discontinued) long-form of the decennial census.
