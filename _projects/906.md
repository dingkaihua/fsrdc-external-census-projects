abstract: "The proposed project seeks to describe and explain the unique character of the cooperative business model, focusing on: (i) where cooperatives exist (both geographically and sectorally), (ii) how their incidence in the U.S. economy has evolved over time, (iii) how they differ structurally from investor-owned companies (e.g., scale and scope of operation, labor management and pay practices, capital structure, inter-firm linkages), and (iv) how these differences affect firm- and market-level economic performance."
