abstract: "This project combines U.S. Census Bureau data with external information on workplace hazards to benchmark data consistency at the plant level, to model the determinants of those hazards, and to see how they affect economic performance at manufacturing plants. The relationship of hazards and plant data as reported will be investigated to learn if negative shocks to production resulting from accidents or catastrophes are accurately reflected in the data. We also examine the determinants of workplace hazards, based on a model of a profit-maximizing plant choosing an optimal level of hazard abatement, given the pressures it faces. These pressures include the expected fine from being cited by an Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector for the workplace hazard. Unionization of the plant is expected to provide an incentive for hazard reduction, both from increasing worker knowledge about workplace hazards and from providing a framework in which to negotiate compensating wage differentials. Our models of wages, employment, investment, and productivity will help identify situations in which we would expect a plantâ€™s economic variables to change dramatically (a new union contract or a new government safety regulation requiring substantial new investments), which we will compare to the time-series variation in the Census Bureau data that these external pressures are expected to influence. A better understanding of external factors (e.g., unionization and workplace hazards) influencing economic outcomes such as productivity will also be valuable to Census Bureau analysts and researchers to evaluate circumstances when data and estimate adjustments may be warranted due to temporary disruptions in plant production."
