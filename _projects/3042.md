abstract: "I develop a dynamic economic geography model of spatially distinct labor markets. The model fea- tures mobile workers between regions and industries, input-output relationships between sectors, and producitivity spillovers, three forces that determine patterns of agglomeration and coagglomer- ation in the economy. Firms are multiestablishment and endogenously choose where to hire workers for R&D development and for production given their productivity and trade costs. I estimate the frictions in the model using panel microdata to track flows of workers and firms between regions following local labor supply shocks. I study how regional industrial policies enacted by the U.S. government impact the distribution of economic activity across space. The effects of these policies depend on the labor, input-output, and productivity spillovers across industries and regions esti- mated in my model. Further, the policies affect where firms open R&D branches and where they open production branches, which impact regional price and wage inequality."
