abstract: "This project aims to understand respondents' answers to Census Bureau questions about race using a three-pronged approach. First, we will apply demographic life table techniques to restricted data to learn about the characteristics of people who have changed their answers to race questions between censuses. Second, we will investigate the characteristics of American Indians/Alaska Natives who neglected to report their tribes when asked as part of the race question. Third, we will study why some children of interracially married people are reported to be multiracial on the post-2000 race question, but many are reported to be single race. "
