abstract: "This project will investigate mechanisms underlying TFP shocks and, more precisely, differences in the magnitude of TFP shocks. The research will look at several potential mechanisms, including (but not limited to) weather, demand shocks, measurement error, and other mechanisms. The project will use the Annual Survey of Manufactures and its supplemental Management and Organizational Practices Survey, as well as data from the Census of Manufactures, Census of Services, Commodity Flow Survey, Exporter Database, Export Foreign Trade Data, Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database, Ownership Change Database, Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization, and the Business Register. This project will address issues in output measurement, including how inventories of finished goods and intermediate materials alter the measurement of outputs and inputs and spill over into the measurement of productivity. In addition, the project will produce measures of productivity for the service sector, a sector for which issues of measurement of inputs and outputs differs considerably from that in manufacturing, from where most experience in measuring productivity is drawn."
