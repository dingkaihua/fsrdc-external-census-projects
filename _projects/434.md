abstract: " 
This proposal will examine the relative behavior of small and large firms over the business cycle. A widely held view is that monetary policy fluctuations play a central role in the business cycle and that these fluctuations affect small firms disproportionately. We plan to ask whether the data support this view. Furthermore, some researchers have argued that markups of prices over costs fluctuate systematically with the business cycle and that these fluctuations are tied to the size of firms. We plan to document the relationship between the cyclical properties of markups and the size of firms. 
This project will use the Longitudinal Research Database, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Quarterly Financial Reports, and the Enterprise Summary Report (ES9100) to obtain establishment- and firm-level information about sales, employment, value added, inventories, capital expenditures, the cost of materials, and ownership. These data will be compiled into a panel dataset of establishments and of the firms to which these establishments belong. For larger firms, we plan to link these data to data from CompustatÂ® on the financial conditions of the firms, as well as to monetary policy indicators and other business cycle indicators. These will be examined for fluctuations over time and with respect to the business cycle. 
The predominant purpose of this proposal is to inform the U.S. Census Bureau about differences in behavior of small and large firms in varying economic climates. Hence, the project will prepare estimates of the population characteristics regarding the differential sensitivity of small and large firms to business cycles. These analyses will not only further the understanding of the quality of Census Bureau data for small vs. large firms, but could also lead to improvements in the methodology for collecting, measuring, or tabulating data in Title 13, Chapter 5 surveys and censuses."
