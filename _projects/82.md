abstract: "Our knowledge of the prevalence and nature of non-lethal violence is highly dependent on data collected by agencies that serve victims. While such data sources contribute to our understanding of violence, the victim contacts that are detected by these systems understate and possibly misrepresent total prevalence and incidence rates. The proposed research pursues two main objectives. First, we will use National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data to estimate the probabilities that a victim will contact the police, seek medical care, or both, conditional on individual and situational factors. Second, we will explore whether distinctive contextual features of local areas contribute to further variation in the likelihood that victims seek services. To achieve the first objective, the proposed research will rely on public-use NCVS data of assault incidents to explore the influence of various incident features on the probability of agency contacts with police, healthcare providers, or both systems. To achieve the second objective, we will estimate contextual effects by linking area-identified NCVS data with criminal justice policy and healthcare data for 48 of the largest 50 US cities. The analysis will seek to identify system features that are associated with an increased likelihood of victim/agency contacts."
