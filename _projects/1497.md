abstract: "This research explores the effects of labor mobility on firms’ financial decisions. More mobile workers are better insured against involuntary separation risk wrought by higher leverage and thus can accommodate higher debt levels. However, unlike physical capital, a firm does not own its employees’ human capital. Thus, when a firm exhibits poor performance, mobile workers are more likely to voluntarily leave than to accept lower wages. This voluntary separation risk induces a higher degree of operational leverage (fixed cost of operation) which may then crowd out financial leverage and lead to lower debt levels at firms with more mobile labor forces. The goal of this study is to use local labor market conditions and regulatory shocks to employees’ abilities to switch firms to disentangle and separately measure these two opposite effects."
