abstract: "This research seeks to characterize the U.S. buyer-supplier network. Arguably one of the most vital economic systems in existence, surprisingly no one to date has theoretically or empirically modeled its structure. The researchers will begin by establishing basic (yet previously undocumented) facts about the U.S. input-output structure. They will then develop a dynamic model of firm birth, death, expansion, contraction, and trade that captures the economic fundamentals driving the evolution of the economy's buyer-supplier network structure. Solving the model to generate predicted vertical production patterns, they will take these to the data to estimate the model's parameters. This will permit any one of a number of conceptual exercises to investigate how various policies or changes in economic fundamentals would impact the equilibrium buyer-supplier network structure. The analyses will revolve around the following questions: When are two establishments likely to be linked to one another? How are shocks transmitted across linked establishments/firms? How are shocks transmitted within firms and how is production organized within firms, across their establishments? Finally, do shocks to individual firms or establishments have aggregate effects? "
