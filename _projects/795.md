abstract: "This project uses data from the Insurance Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS-IC) in conjunction with the Longitudinal Business Database to develop a methodology to construct a quality-and-risk-adjusted hedonic price index for health insurance premiums. The hedonic price index will be an estimate of the premium level in a local geographic market in a particular year, holding quality and risk constant. Since this project will also examine the role that geography plays in setting these premiums, the estimated premiums will be used to test whether insurance prices differ across local geographic markets. In so doing, this project will also examine the factors that affect health insurance premiums and will develop a method to impute for non-response based on these factors."
