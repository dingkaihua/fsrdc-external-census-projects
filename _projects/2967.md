abstract: "This research will combine employer-employee linked data from the Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics (LEHD) program with other administrative and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as external data, to analyze how differential "costs" between entrepreneurship and standard work impact workers' decisions about entering into entrepreneurship, as well as the associated business outcomes of those ventures. The project will analyze these topics through the lens of two populations that have potentially costly access to entrepreneurship and standard work: immigrants and justice-impacted individuals. Both immigrants and justice-impacted individuals face various frictions in both the labor market and the ability to engage in entrepreneurship - frictions such as regulation and discrimination, credit market frictions, and social and cultural barriers. Yet, both groups are important sources of new firms in the United States. The researchers will exploit the various frictions faced by these groups to better understand the entrepreneurial process, asking under what circumstances these populations start and grow businesses and affect their local economies, and ultimately how the Census Bureau can better capture outcomes for young businesses founded by these groups. These analyses will shed light on entrepreneurial decisions and outcomes and help provide a better understanding of choices between work and entrepreneurship."
