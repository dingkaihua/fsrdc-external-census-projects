abstract: "Concern over the nearly ten million American children who lack health insurance prompted Congress to create the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Amendment.  CHIP greatly expands the number of low-income children eligible for publicly subsidized health insurance.  However, as prior experience with Medicaid (the public health insurance for poor mothers and children) has shown, eligibility does not necessarily ensure enrollment: an estimated 4.7 million children potentially eligible for Medicaid failed to enroll in 1997 (Selden, Banthin and Cohen, 1998).  In response, federal officials have mandated as part of CHIP that states develop specific strategies to overcome enrollment barriers faced by low-income populations in order to increase the proportion of children with health insurance.   Because each state has developed its own strategy for encouraging low income families to insure their children as part of the program, CHIP provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of different outreach strategies and program characteristics on enrollment in the program. 
I propose to evaluate state outreach efforts and program structure on the decision of low-income families to insure their children through private or public insurance programs, using the March Current Population Survey (CPS) annual demographic surveys for 1997-2000 and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 1996 cohort.  However, it is necessary to consider additional environmental factors (i.e. the price of medical care, physician supply and cost of providing health insurance in a particular area, as well as other labor market characteristics) that will affect family access to and choice of health insurance. These factors vary widely across and within states and therefore must be measured at the local or county level.  These factors cannot be controlled for using publicly-available CPS and SIPP data that excludes county identifiers for more than half the sample."
