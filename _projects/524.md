abstract: "In the United States, the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement is the primary dataset used to measure these earnings inequality.  However, over time U.S. Census Bureau survey and data storage decisions have changed the maximum value of income items reported from survey respondents. These limits were disproportionately restrictive in earlier years. Feng and Burkhauser (2005) argue that their loosening in later years is likely to have disproportionately impacted inequality levels and trends over time.  Despite these problems, we argue that even using only the public-use data, researchers can make sensible inferences with respect to levels and trends in inequality.  This project will apply both the non-parametric  and parametric approaches to the restricted-access CPS income data from 1975 to the present.  By doing so, we will better measure the income and earnings distributions. In particular, we want to see how the upper portions of these distributions affect the levels and trends of inequality measures such as the Gini coefficients. We will also evaluate the extent to which public-use data can be used to capture inequality levels and trends, using the approaches we pro-posed.  Most importantly, the study will allow us to detect the differences in measuring inequality using the public-use data and restricted-access data. This will increase the value of public-use data to the research community, while still preserving the confidentiality of the restricted access data."
