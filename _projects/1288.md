abstract: "The main objective of this project is to produce new causal evidence of the importance of the School Breakfast Program (SBP) in reducing food insecurity in school-aged children. This research also examines whether the SBP cushions the impacts of high food prices on food insecurity in families and whether the SBP has been effective in dampening the rise in food insecurity during the recent recession."
