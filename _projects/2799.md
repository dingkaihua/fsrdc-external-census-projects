abstract: "Employers may be valued because they provide stepping-stones to other firms that pay higher wages or provide faster wage growth. This project studies this employer effect on the long-term earnings and labor mobility, and how such mobility patterns in the data related to network structures connecting firms influence employment transitions. To this end, we will explore matched employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, linked with other data sets of workers and employers. We will augment AKM estimates for wages with similarly constructed estimates for both rates of wage growth within a worker-employer match and for discounted long-term earnings associated with a match. In turn, we will explore how these estimated variables influence turnover and how they relate to firm characteristics that might define a network structure. To give a broader perspective of our project, we will construct a model with a network structure of employers to capture the searching process of workers. We expect to find that employer effect on longer-term earnings differs in expected wage growth on the job and the ability to transition to a better paying job. Expected findings also include network relationships among employers shown to affect working decisions, and thus earnings and mobility."
