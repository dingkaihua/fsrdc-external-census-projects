abstract: "Evidence on the use of personal computers strongly suggests that the adoption of new technologies has occurred at a much faster pace in some parts of the US than in others, and that this is causally influenced by the skills of the local work force. If technology use and implementation differs substantially by US region, it would be of interest to decision-makers and researchers to have statistics that document these regional differences. It would also be of value to the Census Bureau to have regionally representative micro data on the use of technology. This paper proposes to use the Surveys of Manufacturing Technology (1988, 1991, 1993) to generate a new publicly available aggregate data series: tabulated statistics representative of manufacturing employment and establishments by state and by major metropolitan area on the prevalence and reasons for use of advanced manufacturing technologies. In addition, two sets of sample weights which will allow future users of the SMT micro data to construct statistics that are representative of manufacturing establishments or employment in arbitrary U.S. regions (comprised of counties or states) will be constructed through a match to establishment universe data in the County Business Patterns county and state summary files (1988, 1991, 1993) and Censuses of Manufacturers (CM) (1987, 1992) by sample strata and region. Employment representative weights will also be constructed through a CM-SMT match by establishment id. The matches will also be used to investigate the geographic representativeness of the SMT, and a report with recommendations for the design of future technology surveys, including the possibility of geographic stratification, will be written. Developing new ways of presenting statistical data to the public, creating sample weights, verifying sample frame and documenting new data collection needs each constitute benefits to the Census Bureau under Title 13, Chapter 5. The project will use the regionally representative technology data to investigate the extent to which local work force skills affect technology use and worker productivity (wages). To do so, the prevalence of different technologies will be regressed on local work force characteristics as measured in public use survey data (Censuses of Population and Current Population Surveys) across metropolitan areas. For the purpose of causal inference, instrumental variables regressions will be estimated using instruments for the skills of the local work force developed from the tendency of immigrants from different parts of the world to settle in particular US labor markets. In order to estimate the impact of any technological response on productivity, production functions that include particular technologies and local work force skills will be estimated. Manufacturersâ€™ reports of the benefits (e.g. improve product quality) and costs (e.g. costs of training workers) of technology will also be assessed as channels through which the skills of the local work force operate to affect technological change."
