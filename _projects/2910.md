abstract: "This project will use a novel dataset currently containing 96,032 bankruptcy cases to investigate how the practice of (judicial) forum shopping affects workers and firm survival rates. Predicted impacts are theoretically ambiguous. Firms could select courts that have better expertise and possess more precedent-setting cases, reducing the uncertainty associated with a bankruptcy outcome. On the other hand, firms could select locations where judges tend to favor of managers, lawyers, and/or senior creditors at the expense of workers. This question is important since more than 60 percent of U.S. bankruptcy cases are handled in only two district courts. Additional research will study whether bankruptcy conversions depend on firm characteristics such as founding member composition, and how such variation affects post-filing outcomes like employment growth, wages, and market exit."
