abstract: "Exposure to environmental emissions may be an important determinant of health outcomes, but it is difficult to obtain scientific evidence on this point given the infeasibility of conducting randomized experiments. This research examines the relationship between emis­sions and health outcomes using establishment-level data in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and linked establishment-level surveys (the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Census of Mining, the Census of Transportation, Communications, and Utilities, and the Census of Wholesale Trade) merged with publicly-available information about emissions. The research design will exploit the precise record of establishment openings and closings in the LBD to identify effects on health outcomes. The first objective of this project is to evaluate the accuracy of establishment openings and closings in the LBD by merg­ing the LBD with establishments in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). The second objective of the project is to generate new estimates of the effect of indus­trial emissions on human mortality. The U.S. Census Bureau’s National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) is a database designed for studying the effects of demographic and socio-economic characteristics on mortality rates. The estimates will help realize the objective of the NLMS, helping the Census Bureau better understand the role of environmental factors as a determinant of human mortality, as well as to better understand the extent to which industrial emissions have been a confounding factor in existing studies of mortality using the NLMS."
