abstract: "This project attempts to increase the usefulness of the Census Bureau's international trade statistics by assessing the quality and possible biases of the shipment-level data that lie behind them. A second goal is to develop descriptive statistics and structural models that characterize the formation and maturation of cross-border business relationships, again using shipment-level data. Both dimensions of the analysis will improve an understanding of trade flow dynamics between the United States and its trading partners. The first part of this project will document international discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics at the level of individual shipments, looking in particular for evidence that might indicate a reporting/collection problem on the U.S. side. The second part of the project will augment the trade shipments records with information on the characteristics of the exporting firms and importing firms, which will allow study of the characteristics of buyer-seller matches. One exercise will involve the estimation of a dynamic model of international trade in which firms' exporting (importing) behavior reflects a search and learning process in their foreign markets. A second exercise will develop descriptive statistics that allow characterization of the evolution of international buyer-seller networks, and will contrast the characteristics of rapidly expanding networks (China-U.S.) with slower-growing networks (Colombia-U.S.). A third type of exercise will involve the development of structural models of international buyer-seller networks."
