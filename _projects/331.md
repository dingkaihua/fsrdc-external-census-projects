abstract: "This research seeks to use the Long form sample of the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses to investigate residential choice patterns at two levels of geography, the labor market area and the neighborhood. In this study, I define labor market areas as groups of counties that have substantial commuting ties (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996). Neighborhood will be measured by Census Tract or BNA. I investigate how individuals’ decisions to stay or to move, and to where, are affected by racial, ethnic, and immigrant composition. The study will assess whether residential choice patterns are consistent with any of the following theoretical frameworks: (1) avoidance of racial outgroups, (2) preference for one's racial ingroup, (3) economic avoidance of poor areas, (4) race and ethnicity based social capital, and (5) classic spatial assimilation, in which immigrant groups reside in more higher status areas as they gain socioeconomic status. I examine variations in choice patterns by racial group, ethnicity, and nativity status, as well as recent trends from 1985 to 2000, paying particular attention to intragenerational changes for immigrant cohorts. The study is especially interested in differences for labor market area versus neighborhood choice. Statistical analysis will utilize a nested discrete choice model in which the top level consists of labor market areas and the bottom level consists of all neighborhoods within the chosen labor market area. The main geographic characteristics of interest are racial, ethnic, and immigrant composition, but the models will also control for economic conditions, such as unemployment and poverty rates, and area type, e.g. metropolitan or nonmetropolitan, and urban, suburban, or rural status. Individual level variables will include race, ethnicity, and nativity, human capital information, such as education and occupation, and demographic traits such as age and marital status. Spouse’s demographic information will also be included if available. This proposed project provides several benefits for the Census Bureau. First, I will document all coding errors and inconsistencies in the data within census year. Second, I will examine racial classification changes between 1990 and 2000 for spatial concentration and migration. Third, I will provide statistics for examining the change in migration question from five- to one- year migration. Fourth, I will assess tract population change and homogeneity over the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Fifth, I will produce estimates of the population characteristics in the areas of spatial concentration and migration rates, by racial category. "
