abstract: "This study examines how capital market forces affect incentive design and influence managerial decisions within firms. This project investigates differences in information provision and related incentives between public and private firms, examines the management practices and incentive structures within companies, and details the degree to which firm-level incentives translate into establishment-level outcomes. To that end, this project employs data from several Census Bureau surveys, as well as financial accounting information publicly disclosed by firms on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission forms 10-K and 10-Q."
