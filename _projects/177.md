abstract: "This project investigates whether official Census measures of poverty, income, and the income distribution (and of the impact of government tax and transfer policies on these measures) can be improved by taking into account more than a single year’s worth of income (potentially up to an individual’s entire lifetime). This project will benefit the Census Bureau in five ways. First, the predominant purpose of this study is to improve Census measures of poverty and income by incorporating multi-year measures. Second, in the process of conducting this research I will compare SIPP survey measures of earnings and Social Security benefits with administrative data on these same measures. Third, I will compare SIPP measures of earnings among workers with multiple jobs to administrative data on jobs for each individual. Fourth, I will compare the SIPP topical module on lifetime work history with administrative earnings data. Fifth, I will develop and evaluate a dynamic statistical model for imputing earnings levels above the Social Security taxable maximum that will be useful in constructing the “potential PIA” variable that the Census Bureau is planning to add to the SIPP."
