abstract: "Empirical studies of interregional trade in North America have found that trade within national borders exceeds trade across national borders by a factor of twenty.  This study proposes and tests explanations for why trade appears to be so dramatically reduced by national borders.  The chief hypothesis is that firms' location decisions endogenously create "home bias" in trade flows.  Additional implications of the model include magnification (measured border costs dramatically overstate true costs), hysteresis (measured border effects persist after actual costs drop to zero) and internal border effects (shipping patterns within a country exhibit discontinuities that mimic costs).  The paper suggests theoretical improvements on the standard "gravity" model of trade, and proposes empirical tests that can be used to assess the model, relative to the gravity model. We will use the Commodity Flow data to analyze two broad implications of this model.  One, are composition effects, ignored in the previous literature, critical for understanding measured border effects? Two, are the co-location decisions of intermediate and final goods producers the source of the composition effects?"
