abstract: "This proposed study aims to increase the utility of the LBD, the ILBD and the QFR data through a study of the relationship between quantitative easing (QE) and business survival. It will verify the LBD, the ILBD and the QFR data with external credit bureau data, explore credit usage by small firms, and produce novel estimates of the relationship between QE and business survival. Preliminary work with credit bureau data, Experian Business Aggregates Dataset (BizzAgg), finds that businesses in places with more refinances during QE1 were more likely to survive from 2009 through 2015. We aim to use the LBD, the ILBD and the QFR data to conduct a more rigorous assessment of this relationship between QE and the distribution of business activities. "
