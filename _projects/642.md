abstract: "This project seeks to improve the understanding and the quality of the plant-level data on environmental spending collected in the Census Bureau’s Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey. The project combines PACE data with other Census Bureau datasets and with external data to model the impact of pollution abatement spending on economic factors, such as the plant’s production costs and productivity, as well as its pollution emissions. The research will test accuracy of reported abatement expenditures by modeling their impact on total factor productivity levels, which should decrease productivity on a one-for-one basis if abatement activities contribute nothing to production. It also models the plant’s production function, testing whether the productivity of speciﬁc types of inputs are more seriously aﬀected by pollution abatement activities. Analyses include tests for differences across plants in abatement costs and in their impact on productivity, based on plant size, age, and other observed characteristics. The project will also model the impact of reported abatement costs on a variety of business decisions, including shifts in economic activity and investment, providing an indirect test for the reality of abatement costs. The project will beneﬁt the Census Bureau in several ways. The PACE survey has been recently resumed after an extended hiatus, so information about its data quality and comparisons to data from earlier versions of the survey are valuable. Our models of the impact of reported PACE spending on productivity and emissions test their validity in two ways: are they costs, and do they abate pollution? Our external datasets provide information on production technology and material use that will be used to assess the quality of comparable Census Bureau-collected information. Finally, the external datasets (particularly the Environmental Protection Agency’s Facility Registry System) provide care-fully maintained name-address, latitude-longitude, and plant ownership data that will provide information about the quality of the comparable Census Bureau information and how quickly that information is updated."
