abstract: "The proposed research will investigate the impact of violence on non-victims. We will combine geo-coded homicide data from six cities over ten years with a longitudinal data set containing all business establishments in these cities to determine whether localized surges in homicide activity have an impact on neighborhood business districts. If, after controlling for prior trends in business activity, homicide surges are followed by closings of retail and personal services business establishments, this will provide empirical evidence that non-victims, such as customers and employees, are changing their behavior and thereby incurring a cost from increases in violence. The proposed research will provide a number of significant benefits to the Census Bureau. Because the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) is a new data set, the project will provide the Bureau with an early assessment of the quality of the data. The study utilizes temporal and spatial aspects of the data, thus allowing for tests of the stability of the data across both dimensions. For the six cities, the research will hopes to provide important improvements to the geocoding of the existing LBD data by creating a stable set of ZIP groups, which will be created by accounting for the changes the U.S. Postal Service makes in ZIP codes over time. A bridge file linking old ZIP boundaries to new ones in order to create a stable list of ZIPs will be given to CES to aid to future researchers. Finally, the proposed research will provide new insights into the relationship between neighborhood job growth and violence that will assist federal, state and local decision makers in designing practices and allocating resources to improve the quality of life in urban areas. By helping to provide additional information about the interactions between residents and the characteristics of the local business community, we will help provide richer measures of the census variables."
