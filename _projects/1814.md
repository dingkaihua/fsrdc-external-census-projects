abstract: "This research examines which organizational policies contribute to efficient information collection and dissemination within manufacturing firms. Specifically, we will use the Census of Manufactures and the Management and Organizational Practices Survey to examine how (1) organizational structure, (2) managerial incentives along corporate hierarchy and corporate governance policies, and (3) the extent of use of information technologies, affect the quality of corporate disclosures. Examining how each dimension of organization policy affects corporate disclosures will help to understand the process of corporationsâ€™ internal communication, and build on and aim to contribute new insights to the determinants of high-quality corporate disclosures."
