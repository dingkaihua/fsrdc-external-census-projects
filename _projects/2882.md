abstract: "Research from a variety of academic disciplines has demonstrated that low-income Americans disproportionately experience both criminal justice system involvement and housing instability. Extant research has not, however, evaluated the connection between the two. For this project, I hope to link CJARS criminal record  and LSC eviction data, which will enable examination of whether eviction and other housing outcomes lead to subsequent criminal justice system involvement. Building on past work in criminology, sociology, and policy studies, this work will generate new evidence about the linkages between housing and criminal justice outcomes in the U.S."
