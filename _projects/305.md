abstract: "This project proposal has two research goals. First, using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), we plan to revise our working paper NBER #6270 and CES-WP-98-3 we produced under a prior BRDC project. Second, we intend to investigate the impact of the change in industrial classification systems from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) from a spatial perspective. The NAICS represents a move forward in industrial classification from the SIC, but it is still difficult to appraise the geographic implications of this change in classification, both from the perspective of the longitudinal transition across years of Census of Manufacturers before and after 1997, as well as for what we know about the geographic distribution of economic activity. Does the geographic concentration of NAICS classified industries differ from that of comparable SIC classified industries, or are they very similar? By comparing locational measures for different industry classifications, we can begin to tell whether different classifications create different biases that Census planners and researchers need to be aware of. Finally, by looking at changes in industry classification for plants over time, we can check whether the NAICS system has led to more or less consistency in classification over time."
