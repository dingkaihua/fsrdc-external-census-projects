abstract: "This study examines the establishment and evolution of firms’ international trading relationships at the transaction level using a novel “two-sided” firm trade transactions dataset which, for the period 1992 through 2011, links U.S. importers from the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database to exporters from Korean firm-level data provided by a Korean credit agency. This research exploits the unique ownership structure of Korean firms, the majority of which operate under the control of a business group. Specifically, this study tests for evidence of export spillovers for firms within the same ownership structure and estimates the degree of information transfer. The researchers hypothesize that firms with more information about a foreign market face lower costs in building new trade relationships abroad. Thus, with the transfer of information and market-specific knowledge, firms should benefit from being in business groups where member companies have more trade relationships. Furthermore, this impact may be even stronger if a Korean company has a foreign affiliate in the United States. The project also examines whether the sharing of information was helpful during the recent global financial crisis in avoiding the loss of exports at the intensive margin and the loss of trading relationships at the extensive margin."
