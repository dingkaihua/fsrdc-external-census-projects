abstract: "This research will analyze the energy intensity of individual manufacturing establishments in order to understand how dynamics such as entry, exit, and within-plant changes contribute to trends in the energy intensity of the overall economy. This project will benefit the Census Bureau by examining the quality of energy expenditure data in the Census of Manufacturers and Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and the implications of different imputation procedures – regression imputation, hot-decking, and single vs. multiple imputation – on statistics derived from the data."
