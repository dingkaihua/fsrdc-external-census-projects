abstract: "The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the largest tenant-based rental housing subsidy in the nation. Prior research presents mixed evidence regarding the location outcomes for recipient households. This project seeks to identify the types of households, market conditions, and neighborhood composition that are more likely to promote mobility and access to high-opportunity neighborhoods for voucher recipients. It will extend past research on the HCV program to address these questions at a national scale and analyze temporal dynamics (such as conditions pre- and post-voucher receipt), a feature that is absent in the existing literature.
This research will produce new comparative statistics about the static and time-varying representation of voucher and non-voucher households according to neighborhood characteristics. For example, we will examine the characteristics of neighborhoods that see a relatively quick loss of HCV households within a short period of time. Further, this project will simulate outcome projections of the implementation of Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs), broadly and based on sociodemographic and market factors. By identifying the proportion of HCV households likely impacted by SAFMRs, and their probable characteristics, this research will offer timely insight into the efficacy of this approach to setting voucher standards. Additionally, this research will yield a variety of estimates describing voucher households and their residential mobility behavior based on recipient, household, housing unit, market, and other locational characteristics.
