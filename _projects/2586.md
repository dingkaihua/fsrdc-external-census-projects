abstract: "This project examines how the distribution of firm size in the economy responds to shocks and other changes in the economic environment. Using the Longitudinal Business Database, along with other Census Bureau micro-level data that cover nearly the universe of firms operating in the U.S. since the late 1970s, we provide evidence on how important are differences in firm size in explaining heterogeneity in how firms respond to long-term demand shocks. The analysis emphasizes the role of firms' scope - the number of locations, establishments, product lines, or products operated by a firm - in this heterogeneous response. Motivated by the findings in the data, we propose a theory of firm size, where both scope and productivity are chosen endogenously."
