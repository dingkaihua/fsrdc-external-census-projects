abstract: "The purpose of this project is to evaluate survival patterns of firms in the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO), particularly minority-owned firms in metropolitan areas. The project results will provide information that can be used to improve measurement of business survival in the new Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO).  This project proposes to use the most current (1992) version of the CBO to revisit earlier findings regarding firm survival patterns.  It will investigate the robustness of the CBO database for portraying small-business survival patterns for employer businesses, using the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to track CBO firm survival patterns.  This research also is relevant to the new SBO. Information from this will increase the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s knowledge base regarding business survival dynamics. The SBO survey staff can use this knowledge to improve SBO response rates by tailoring their sample designs to businesses based on their likelihood of still being in business.  This could help reduce the number of out-of-scope cases that occur when a portion of the sample is selected from the previous year business register, but responses are only used when the business remains active for the next year. The results from this research can also assist the Census Bureau in the construction or improvement of the sampling frame for the SBO survey."
