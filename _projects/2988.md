abstract: "This project investigates how credit market frictions affect firm behavior. To document the causal effect, we will exploit time-series variation in the restrictiveness of creditor collection practices across states. Stronger creditor restrictions reduce debt recovery rates, which ultimately make creditors reduce credit supply. We hypothesize that stronger creditor restrictions negatively affect entrepreneurial activities, due to the following two mechanisms. First, stronger restrictions make it harder for entrepreneurs to borrow money from creditors, which could inhibit their abilities to launch or maintain businesses. Second, stronger restrictions also influence credit supply for local customers, which could lower the demand for products and services. This project includes three sub-questions. First, we will utilize the QFR to measure firm debt structure and investigate whether there is a reduction in unsecured debt when lenders face more restrictions. Next, we will obtain measures of firms' revenue from the SAS/ARTS/LBD and test whether more restrictions hurt firms' revenue. Finally, we will use establishment-level LBD data to explore how multi-segment firms with establishments in different regions react to changes in creditor restrictions. By producing estimates of these questions, this project will enhance the Census Bureau's understanding of economy-wide establishment dynamics (formation, closure, growth, contraction, and performance) and their responsiveness to changes in credit market conditions."
