abstract: "This project seeks to provide estimates that establish the differences in union formation between the establishments of domestic firms and those of multinational ones, and the differences in labor compensation between unionized establishments and non-unionized ones of multinational and non-multinational firms, respectively. This research uses restricted establishment-level and firm-level data in order to determine geographic locations of plants and their workersâ€™ compensation and benefits, as well as transactional trade data to determine whether firms engage in related-party trade and thus are multinational or not. The research also uses data on state right-to-work law and National Labor Relations Board election results."
