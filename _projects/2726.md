abstract: "The project explores multiple mechanisms affecting how firms spend R&D, how that R&D spending translates to innovative outcomes, and how those innovative outcomes are protected. US Census Data is instrumental in linking such mechanisms to R&D inputs and outcomes. The mechanisms explored in the project are private vs. public firm incorporation, long-term incentive compensation, firm scope, firm R&D structure, firm vertical integration, and industry competition. Although much of the data associated with these mechanisms will be linked from external sources, US Census data provides important information about employee compensation, firm scope, firm R&D structure, and industry innovation. The main importance of US Census data for this project is in linking R&D spending characteristics, innovative outcomes, and IP protection to these short-term (or long-term) mechanisms at the firm level. These data include the nature of short-term versus long-term R&D spending (basic vs. applied, research vs. development) and the importance of various IP protection mechanisms (patenting versus secrecy, etc.) with additional outcome measures such as patents and publications linked from external data."
