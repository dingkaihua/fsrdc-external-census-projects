abstract: "This project aims to quantify the extent to which initial market conditions determine manufacturing establishments' subsequent input mix. We focus on the role of initial energy prices for short and long-run energy usage as an example of this technology lock-in. We propose to conduct this analysis using data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Census of Manufactures, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, the Annual Capital Expenditure Survey, and the Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs & Expenditures from the Census Bureau, in combination with several external data sources on U.S. energy prices. First, we will use these data sets to provide new descriptive evidence on the importance of energy prices in the year of an establishment's entry for subsequent energy efficiency, summarizing the effects by entry cohort and by initial energy price. Second, we will estimate a dynamic structural model of entry, exit, and capital investment to simulate how the energy intensity of production would change for entrant and incumbent establishments under several counterfactual market conditions. Our goal is to use the structural model to study how raising energy prices and reducing capital adjustment costs affect the investment decisions and the input mix of U.S. manufacturing establishments.
