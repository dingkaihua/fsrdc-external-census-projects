abstract: "This study characterizes the innovative and entrepreneurial efforts of firms in the U.S. economy. It begins with a detailed analysis of the R&D-to-patenting inventive process and further delineates how this innovation translates into within-firm productivity growth and across-firm knowledge spillovers. It also considers how U.S. national and local governments influence these rates of innovation and entrepreneurship and firm entry more generally. These innovative forces will be finally linked to concomitant technological change, productivity growth, and changes in industrial structure. Specific topics addressed include immigration admissions of foreign-born scientists and engineers, labor market regulations, federal funding of R&D undertaken in private firms, government-backed loans to entrepreneurs and small businesses, banking and financial market structures and regulations, foreign direct investments by multinationals, and patent and trademark laws. Detailed firm-level and establishment-level data are employed to pair a firm’s R&D and patenting efforts with its productivity out-comes, for considering federal support of R&D at the firm-level, and for looking at knowledge spillovers from a research-oriented firm to other businesses within the firm’s state or industry. Establishment data characterize industrial and financial market structures in local areas, including entrepreneurial entry and exit rates, the firm size distribution, and market concentration and agglomeration indexes."
