abstract: "This project will investigate the disclosure risks and data utility associated with using partially synthetic data to limit disclosure risks for people in group quarters in the American Communities Survey.  We will first investigate criteria for deciding which records in group quarters are most at risk.  We will develop approaches to generating partially synthetic data, considering risk and utility of proposed releases.  We also will examine the risk utility tradeoffs of releasing one, two, or five imputed data sets.  We will develop approximations to the variance for single imputation datasets, if needed.  Lastly, we will consider how the survey weights interact with the data synthesis."
