abstract: "I study the US aggregate markup from 1999 to 2019 under the presence of multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity. Accounting for heterogeneity provides a more robust measurement of the firm's markup, and markup is a useful metric to gauge a sector's competitiveness. The standard approach to markup estimation assumes the firm's unobserved heterogeneity only at the productivity factor. My project utilizes a clustering method to detect the firm's unobserved heterogeneity beyond just productivity, e.g., elasticity. I use the data covering the manufacturing, wholesale trader, and retail trader sectors from the Census Bureau. My research aims to document the differences in markup unexplained by the standard methodology. For example, my results will show the widened dispersion of the markup distribution after accounting for additional unobserved heterogeneity."
