abstract: "This research examines the causal effect of education on civic participation, as measured by voter turnout. In order to do so, this project implements a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that relies on exact date of birth relative to school entry cutoff dates. Data from the long form of the 2000 Decennial Census and the ACS (2002-2014) contain respondentsâ€™ exact date of birth, which allows the researchers to estimate whether individuals born just before the applicable school entry cutoff date in their state of residence are, on average, slightly more educated than those born just after the cutoff. This research will rely on voter registration and turnout data for all fifty states and the District of Columbia to estimate whether individuals born just before the cutoff date are more likely to vote; and by relating population estimates based on the 2010 Decennial Census to counts of registered voters in the user-supplied data, estimate whether there exists a discontinuity in the propensity to register to vote in the first place. Finding a discontinuity around school entry cutoff dates in educational attainment as well as voter turnout and/or registration would be evidence that education exerts a causal effect on civic participation. This research will also utilize the CPS Voting and Registration Supplement (2006-2014). "
