abstract: "While an initial public offering is probably the most heralded mechanism of going public, the most common and successful mechanism of going public is, however, through an acquisition of the private firm by an existing public company. Since going public allows the firm to access external financing through the equity market for the first time in its life, going public may have important implications for the firm’s product market performance as well. In this research project, we will analyze (for the first time in the literature) how the product market performance of a firm affects the timing of its going public decision. This analysis will inform the U.S. Census Bureau regarding the behavior of organizational change activity and its determinants, where the timing of changes in ownership informs business register processing activity.  We also analyze the consequences of a firm going public on various aspects of its subsequent product market performance. We propose to identify the sources of this poor performance by studying how a firm’s productivity, sales, market share, labor costs and employment levels, material costs, rental and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures change subsequent to going public. This analysis will provide important information on the way in which firms report the value of these measures as collected by Census Bureau programs."
