abstract: "This research will examine the flow of goods at narrow geographic and industry detail. This will include imports, exports, as well as internal flows within the United States â€“ such as shipment of drywall from China to Miami, or a shipment of medical equipment by a firm in Minneapolis to Boston or Toronto. This study will estimate an economic model of trade flows that will explicitly incorporate the possibility that goods may move through the wholesale sector. This project will produce industry-level parameters related to transportation cost and the use of wholesaling. It will then use these estimates to evaluate the impact of increased international trade on the regional distribution of manufactures."
