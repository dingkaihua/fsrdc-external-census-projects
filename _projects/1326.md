abstract: "Secondary analyses of survey data sets collected from large probability samples of persons or establishments further scientific progress in many academic fields. The samples underlying these data sets, while enabling inferences about population characteristics or relationships between variables of interest in populations of interest, are often "complex" in nature, employing sampling strategies such as stratification of the population and cluster sampling. These complex sample design features improve data collection efficiency, but also complicate secondary analyses in terms of the approaches that need to be employed to account for the complex sampling statistically. Unfortunately, many secondary analysts of these data sets do not have formal training in survey statistics, and ultimately apply incorrect analytic methods when analyzing these data sets, which can lead to incorrect population inferences. This research project reviews published studies of National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) data sets to understand the statistical approaches that users of these data are currently employing, reviews the existing literature in survey statistics with regard to alternative design-based and model-based approaches that are appropriate for complex samples, and then applies these alternative approaches to several NCSES data sets, comparing the resulting inferences for a variety of statistical problems and educating data users about appropriate analytic methods."
