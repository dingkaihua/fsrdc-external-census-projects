abstract: "Manufacturers are increasingly using the Internet to electronically integrate their business processes internally and across their network of trading partners. However, due to a lack of available data sources, information about the adoption and economic impact of Internet business practices is limited. The proposed study seeks to address this shortcoming by analyzing a dataset containing 39 measures of computer net-work use within U.S. manufacturing plants collected within the Computer Network Use Supplement (CNUS) to the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM).  Additional datasets employed provide data on plant characteristics and efficiency for a period of multiple years prior to and beyond the CNUS year (1999), including the Census of Manufactures and the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization. The sample of establishments responding to the CNUS accounts for roughly 50 percent of all manufacturing employment and salaries and 95 per-cent of online manufacturing cost of materials, with substantial variation in response rate by geography and plant size. Given that there may be systematic differences between respondents and nonrespondents, three approaches will be used to examine nonresponse bias. First, known differences in the samples (ASM characteristics such as value of shipments and employees) will be examined. For example, if CNUS respondents tend to be from plants that are on average 10 percent larger, I can estimate the nonresponse bias by estimating the impact of a 10 percent change in plant size on CNUS variables. Second, I will compare measures from an independent survey with those of the CNUS survey. Third, I will compare the response rate to an ASM question on the value of e-shipments as a percentage of all shipments with measures collected within the CNUS, as well as the profile of responding plants to the ASM question versus the CNUS question. Regarding parameter estimates, innovation variables will be computed using the 39 dichotomous items available from the CNUS."
