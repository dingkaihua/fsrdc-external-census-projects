abstract: "This investigation will examine the effects that expansions, contractions, openings, and closings of different-sized establishments in local labor markets have on low-skill employment and wages.  It will first use establishment-specific information from the Business Information Tracking System (BITS) to characterize job flows separately for small and large businesses within different industries within counties.  The investigation will next link its constructed local area job flow measures with individual-level data on earnings, employment, and other personal attributes for low-skill workers from the Sample Edited Detail File (SEDF) of the 1990 Decennial Census and the 1991-97 Annual Demographic files of the Current Population Survey (CPS).  It will regress the individual-level wage and employment outcomes against the local job flow measures, controlling for time- and area-specific fixed effects and observed personal characteristics such as age and race. The investigation will extend recent work by the Principal Investigator on the effects of local employment conditions on skill-specific outcomes by characterizing employment conditions within very detailed industries, distinguishing between different types of job flows, and distinguishing between different-sized establishments."
