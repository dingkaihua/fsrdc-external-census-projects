abstract: "This research will explore the tradeoff faced by firms in choosing to remain privately incorporated or to tap public markets and whether the possibility of tapping private equity financing plays a role in this tradeoff. Is the proprietary cost of disclosure an important consideration in the decision of a firm to go public or stay private, and is private equity financing an important facilitator of large firms with high funding needs staying private in order to avoid high proprietary disclosure costs? This project will identify firms in both the Business Register and the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) that are also in portfolios of private equity funds (also called “financial sponsors”). This research will produce descriptive statistics on how such portfolio companies differ from firms that are publicly held or held by other types of private owners, such as age, size (as measured by sales and assets), industry composition, growth, as well as their product and service innovation strategies. A better understanding of the characteristics of firms owned by private equity funds is of interest because ownership changes impact innovation, investment, and growth. "
