abstract: "This project will use micro data to document firms’ organization of activities across space, and to assess how differences in firms’ geography and international trade activity affect their performance and innovation. A key element in the project is understanding firms’ decisions to own multiple establishments across different locations and industries. We will link detailed input usage data and product line information from the Census of Manufactures (CMF) and the Census of Retail Trade (CRT) to the international trade transactions databases. We will use these rich data to assess whether within-firm variation across establishments and international trade data can be used to impute missing data at the establishment level. We will also assess the extent to which the specific inputs or products that are pre-listed on the various economic census forms can be updated both to gather more relevant information and to reduce respondent burden. This project will also assess the extent to which various decisions, such as technology upgrading, take place at the establishment versus firm level. We will combine technology information from various surveys to document whether use of different technologies, such as electronic networks, are made at the establishment or firm level. By comparing technology responses across surveys, we can shed light on the accuracy of individual surveys. Most importantly, assessing the extent of heterogeneity within a firm and across establishments will provide the Census Bureau with valuable information on whether future technology surveys need to be conducted at the firm versus establishment level."
