abstract: "This project develops and analyzes a set of new summary measures of foreign-born internal migration and settlement within the United States, providing new information on the growing foreign-born populations and their characteristics. Prior research has examined whether and why foreign-born populations migrate internally within the United States, as well as documented to where foreign-born populations go if they do migrate. However, the existing research has not addressed the question of exactly how long foreign-born populations can be expected to settle in U.S. locations. The temporal dynamics and stability of foreign-born populations in the United States have direct implications for local labor markets, education, health, and social services. They are likewise implicated in a number of social and political processes, including intergroup relations and civic participation. Using both publicly available data and restricted access data from the Decennial Censuses and American Community Survey multiyear file, the project develops a set of multiregional population estimates summarizing the expected (average) duration of settlement for 12 foreign-born groups."
