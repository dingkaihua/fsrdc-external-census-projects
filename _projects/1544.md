abstract: "This research examines bank loans as a source of financing for small firms in the U.S. by linking PayNet loan data to Census Bureau microdata. This project will investigate lending patterns to small firms, the geographic proximity of lenders and borrowers, how manufacturers’ productivity correlates with firms’ borrowing, and the role of credit provision in re-allocating capital from less- to more-productive firms. Second, changes in the supply of credit to small firms will be explored as well its effect on real outcomes such as employment, revenues, investment, and survival. The analysis will construct measures of small business lending by lender, to analyze how these are associated with lender characteristics, and then ultimately assess whether lender characteristics associated with declines in small business lending also predict worse outcomes for borrowing firms. A third group of questions revolves around the relative role of credit supply contractions and aggregate demand shortfalls during the Great Recession. A fourth phase investigates the relationship between monetary policy, bank lending, and the real economy by correlating lender characteristics to credit risk-taking, and then studying whether these same characteristics also affect borrower firm outcomes. The project also explores the causes and consequences of financial distress by analyzing the links between the economic conditions of borrowing firms and their financial distress and debt delinquency."
