abstract: "This research will link internal Census data to data on external, location-based designations - area-level treatments applied to particular geographic areas - to analyze area-level development and economic growth measures before and after the application of these treatments. Treatment regions will be compared to non-treatment regions. Treatments to be studied take the form of various designations as part of efforts to spur investment or access to credit. These designations have been prevalent since 1994, when the first round of the Empowerment Zone program was implemented. Empowerment Zones and similar location-based designations have existed regularly since the early 1990s and continue to be relevant today. The researchers will study the effects of various location-based designations over the last 30 years on outcomes such as the number of jobs, average earnings per worker, the number of start-up establishments, total factor productivity (TFP), and labor productivity. The researchers will investigate both localized direct effects and indirect spillovers."
