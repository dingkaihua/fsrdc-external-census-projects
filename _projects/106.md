abstract: "The proposed project would use an existing March 1994 Current Population Survey (CPS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) earnings histories match in combination with the March 1993 supplement and the April 1993 Employee Benefits Supplement, as the input data to a microsimulation model that projects family, work, retirement income, and long-term care use histories through 2050. The two related models, sponsored by the Office of Aging, Disability and Long Term Care Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), Department of Health and Human Services and maintained by The Lewin Group, are entitled the Pension and Retirement Income Simulation Model (PRISM) and the Long-Term Care Financing Model (LTCFM). This data set would replace the existing input dataset which is based on the last available public-use CPS and SSA earnings histories match of the March 1978 CPS. We propose to run the first stage of the model described below at Census facilities. We propose to be allowed to remove the output of the PRISM from the Census facilities because it will contain no original information that was not available from the public use files. Specifically, the earnings histories that will be used to project future social security income would not be retained in the output database. This output data could then be tabulated and also would be used as input data to the LTCFM.
The PRISM and LTCFM are used by ASPE to examine retirement and health care policy issues under consideration by the Congress and the White House. PRISM is a dynamic microsimulation model designed to simulate the retirement income of the elderly (age 65 and older) population. It ages the input database annually from 1979 through 2040, aligning aggregate outcomes to the projections of the Social Security Trustees report. Users of PRISM can simulate changes in laws and regulations related to pensions and social security, as well as modify economic and demographic assumptions. The Long-Term Care Financing Model (LTCFM) simulates nursing home and home care use and expenditures for individuals ages 65 and older to the year 2030. It permits analyses of alternative assumptions about the nature of the elderly population in the future (e.g., declining disability rates) and policy scenarios (e.g., tax incentives for long-term care insurance or changes to Medicaid eligibility)."
