abstract: "Since Adam Smith’s famous ‘pin factory’ fable, economists have been preoccupied with the role that specialization and the division of labor play in economic growth. Surprisingly, however, this recognition of the fundamental impact that specialization plays in economic growth has not led to much systematic empirical work on the organization of specialization. In fact, no systematic empirical work has illuminated such questions as: When do individuals specialize and how does this relate to the complexity of activities? When do specialists work within the same firm, and when do they work in different firms? When is specialization limited by the extent of the market, and when and why is it limited by other factors such as coordination costs? What role do hierarchies play in facilitating specialization? What accounts for differences in hierarchical forms; for example, when do hierarchies tend to be steep versus flat? Empirical evidence on these and other related questions is important for understanding a wide range of issues in industrial organization and labor economics. We propose to use microdata from the legal services portion of the Census of Services to investigate these and other related questions. These data contain firm-level information about the specialties of lawyers and the number of individuals who are partners, associate lawyers, paralegals, and non-legal staff. These data provide a unique opportunity to investigate specialization and hierarchies within professional service firms, and would allow us to study questions such as those described above in an ideal context. Our project would provide a wide array of benefits to the Census Bureau. First, it would aid in understanding and improving the quality of Census of Services data. To our knowledge, no one at CES has worked with the Legal Services microdata. As we put the data into shape and conduct analysis, we will learn better the strengths and weaknesses of the data, which will allow Census staff to revise and improve the existing survey and indicate what other survey questions would generate good data about the organization and growth of this and other professional service industries. Second, it would potentially lead to a new or improved methodology to collect, measure, and tabulate data in professional service industries. Current definitions of the firm used by Census are based on the common ownership and control of physical assets; it is difficult to apply these definitions in contexts such as professional services, where physical assets are not necessarily important. By testing new theories of firms' boundaries that do not revolve around physical assets, we will examine whether new criteria for professional service firms' boundaries should be introduced. This is particularly important in light of the general movement away from manufacturing and toward services in the U.S. economy. Third, it would identify shortcomings of current data collection programs and document new data collection needs by providing evidence regarding the extent and incidence of temporary worker use in different segments of the legal services industry. This would help Census staff develop ways of accounting for such workers in this and other sectors by guiding it to the segments where they are most prevalent. Fourth, in the longer term, our project would be the first step toward enhancing Census' existing legal services data. It may be possible to create a matched worker-establishment database for this industry by merging the data from the Census of Services with that from the Martindale-Hubbell law directories."
