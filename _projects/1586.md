abstract: "This project examines the migration trajectories of international students in the United States, using a combination of restricted-use data from the National Survey of College Graduates, the American Community Survey, and the Decennial Census long form. The research addresses two sets of questions. First, what are the patterns of international studentsâ€™ spatial mobility within the United States, and what explains these patterns? Second, what are the patterns of migration status trajectories for international students in the United States, and what are the consequences of these patterns? The project will generate estimates for the likelihood that international students would move out of the location where they get the first U.S. degrees, and will examine how different contextual characteristics are associated with the likelihood of moving. Additionally, the research will examine the types of educational, spatial, and visa type trajectories that international students experienced while in the United States. These findings will help answer several important lingering questions concerning the retention of international students in places as well as the duration and steps involved in their migration experiences."
