abstract: "The phenomenon of grandparents raising their grandchildren is of increasing national importance.  The aims of this study are (1) to demonstrate the policy relevance of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for better understanding and addressing the needs of grandparent caregivers and their families and (2) to examine grandparent caregivers in the contexts of their households and communities by linking the ACS with 1997 census data on child poverty, median household income and other variables.  Areas of interest include:  urban/rural and regional variations among grandparent caregivers and their families; national variation in the racial and ethnic background of such families; their utilization of income supports, subsidized housing and social services; and the prevalence and correlates of disabilities among grandparent caregivers and their grandchildren."
