abstract: "This study will exploit trade-induced shocks to U.S. manufacturing to study productivity spillovers from de-agglomeration. Using restricted-use microdata from the Economic Census, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database, this project will investigate the response of productivity to local de-agglomeration shocks at a highly disaggregated level. This study intends to uncover the key features of firms' responses to these shocks, including the extent to which these responses vary with geographic and economic distance. This project provides a natural setting to evaluate how nonresponse changes following shocks to the local economy, an issue highlighted by recent Census research."
