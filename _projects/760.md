abstract: "This project addresses a long-going debate in the financial literature regarding the paradox of stock run-up and subsequent deterioration after the issuance. While past studies tried to distinguish between market timing and capital budgeting explanations, the lack of detailed data produced mixed results and conclusions. Census Bureau data on firm's productivity allow a better way of disentangling between these explanations. This study examines the sources of the price increase before the issuance and underperformance after the issuance by examining the production variables at the plant level, including total factor productivity, capacity utilization, costs of inputs and outputs, and subsequent plant acquisition. The ability to observe the changes in the production function of the plants before and after the issuance allows one to determine whether the firms raised capital as a response to improving growth opportunities, which can be captured through increases in productivity, capacity, and profit margins, or whether they just took advantage of current financial market conditions."
