abstract: "This project examines the impact of trade and globalization on U.S. businesses. The project has three objectives. It will study the regional impacts of rapidly growing U.S. foreign exports of services by developing estimates of exports of services at the state level. It will examine the impact of globalization by U.S. multinational companies through direct investment, trade, and the oﬀ -shoring of services on the U.S. economy. It will examine the relationship between an enterprise and its establishments and explore methods of allocating enterprise-level data to establishments in various industries. All three components of this project will involve supplementing data collected at the Census Bureau on U.S. business activities with data collected at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on the operations of multinational ﬁrms and on trade in services. Most Census Bureau business data are collected at the establishment level, while BEA’s surveys are conducted on a consolidated business enterprise basis. Linking these datasets greatly increases their analytic value by allowing questions about decisions made at the enterprise level—such as where to locate production to serve foreign customers—to be examined using the establishment-level data best suited to answering them. This project will build on previous projects that have linked Census data with BEA enterprise data. These previous linking projects have provided beneﬁts to the Census Bureau, and this project will expand on these beneﬁts. For example, it will enable the Census Bureau to improve its sample frames, verify and improve the accuracy of data reported on its surveys, and improve the industry classiﬁcations of enterprises and establishments. In addition, it will greatly increase the utility of the Census Bureau datasets for examining the impact that globalization—in the form of direct investment and trade in services—is having on the U.S. economy."
