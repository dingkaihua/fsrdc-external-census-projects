abstract: "Firms predominantly choose exporting in their efforts to grow via international expansion. As managers formulate their overall exporting strategies, including what products to export, which markets represent the best opportunities for their next export venture(s), and in which markets they should cease export activities, accumulated export experience and related learning play an important role, a phenomenon often referred to in the marketing literature as learning-by-exporting. While the economic trade literature has explored issues associated with exporting a number of products and exporting to a number of markets,  there remain gaps regarding the extent to which exporting different products and exporting to different markets enhance learning from exporting and how much each type of learning (from markets and from products) influences export success. To fill these gaps, we will explore how exporting firms maximize learning based on their export experiences with market and with products.  Specifically, in this project, we will answer the following questions: Does learning from exporting the same product to different markets or different products to the same market contribute more to a firm's export capabilities; how will learning from exporting change over time; and do export capabilities affect export venture survival? To answer these questions, we will estimate multivariate regression models using the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD)."
