abstract: "This study would use the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (NSHAPC) to study the causes of homelessness in the U.S. and analyze policies designed to reduce the problem.  Researchers are still at odds over the main causes of homelessness and, consequently, the best solutions to the problem.  The NSHAPC data will allow for a comprehensive examination of the causes of homelessness across the U.S.  Furthermore, the findings can be used to estimate the role cash and in-kind assistance programs play in reducing the number of homeless in this country and to simulate the effects of welfare reform."
