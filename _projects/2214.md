abstract: "This project will investigate differences in capital structure, investment rates, and rates of return between publicly traded and privately held firms. A long literature in corporate finance has studied the connection between firm ownership, capital structure, and investment. Going public helps firms diversify their funding sources, relaxing financial constraints (Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales 1998). On the other hand, going public increases separation between ownership and control possibly worsening agency problems (Jensen and Meckling 1976). However, evidence on the importance of these mechanisms, and on the net benefits of public ownership, is limited. This is because it is difficult to observe capital structure and investment decisions of private firms. Quantifying the benefits of going public has become a more pressing question in recent years since the number of publicly traded US corporations has declined substantially since the early 2000â€™s (Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz 2017). Our goal in this project is to use data from the Quarterly Financial Report to provide extensive, long-run evidence on average differences in investment and capital structure between private and public firms, on the consequences of going public, and on the contribution of changes in ownership composition to trends in aggregate investment and returns to capital."
