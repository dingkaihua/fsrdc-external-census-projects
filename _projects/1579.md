abstract: "This research will examine the linkages among external finance, employment, and firm dynamics. We examine how financial conditions impact employment and the dynamics of firms over the business cycle. We link bank financial statement/balance sheet data to Census Bureau establishment and firm data to study how the financial crisis of 2008 affected banks’ supply of funds for lending and by extension, firms’ employment outcomes and ability to take out loans. For each employer establishment in the Longitudinal Business Database, we construct a measure to represent the financial constraints facing the firm in their geographic area. This measure is calculated using outside data about the balance sheet conditions of banks, weighted by the relative market share that each bank has in a given establishment’s local area. The hypothesis is that employment will suffer at small/young firms when the financial conditions of local banks deteriorate, because these types of firms are heavily reliant on commercial bank financing. If so, this could explain why entrepreneurial businesses suffered disproportionately during the financial crisis. Besides employment, we will also explore how the financial constraint variable affects other outcomes such as entry and exit rates, productivity, wages, volatility, inventories, and characteristics of new business owners.
