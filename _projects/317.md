abstract: "In this project, we contribute to the ongoing research on the rationales for corporate diversification. Using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) as our main source of data, we examine whether combining several lines of business under one corporate umbrella leads to increased productive performance. Studying the direct effect of diversification on productive efficiency allows us to discern between two major theories of corporate diversification: the agency cost hypothesis and the synergy hypothesis. Further, the project contributes to the literature by investigating whether efficiency differences between diversified and focused firms lead to the “diversification discount”. To measure productive efficiency, we employ a non-parametric approach, the Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM), using establishment-level and firm-level data. This method has several advantages over other conventional measures of productive efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this project is the first application of the WAPM to a sample of non-financial institutions. This project will provide benefits to the Census Bureau’s data programs through understanding and improving the quality of the data. The project will merge the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM/LRD), Census of Manufactures (CM/LRD), Company Auxiliary Offices (CAO), National Employer Survey (NES), Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), and the time-linked version of the SSEL called the Longitudinal Business Database with the public-use databases COMPUSTAT, Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and Security Data Corporation (SDC). Once the databases are merged, comparisons of the data items collected by the Census Bureau to the data contained in the public-use databases will be performed. "
