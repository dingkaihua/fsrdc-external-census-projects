abstract: "This project studies the labor market experiences of the very low-income population and how features of the social safety net affect these experiences and long-term outcomes for families. Bringing the American Community Survey and Decennial Censuses together with longitudinal earnings data from the LEHD and detailed histories of program receipt will allow for more robust analysis of the interaction between program design and labor market outcomes than any dataset individually. In addition to labor market outcomes, this project will also study the population dynamics and long-term population outcomes that result from the design of transfer programs."
