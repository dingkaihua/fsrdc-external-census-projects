abstract: "The proposed research will assess the value of underutilized Census innovation measures for explaining differences in productivity and employment growth in firms, and to evaluate the value of design questions included in the 2022 Annual Business Survey. The first part of the project will link the Census and other innovation datasets to the 2012 and 2017 Economic Census to examine the firm and contextual covariates associated with product and process innovation, and to estimate models of employment and productivity growth. The innovation model specifications will then be used to assess whether auxiliary variables in both the ABS and Economic Census can predict product and process innovation behavior in firms among the much more numerous Economic Census respondents, for which the Small Area Estimation (SAE) methods could be applied in future research. The second part of the project will explore the relationship between design and firm business conditions and employment and payroll growth, using data from the 2014 Rural Establishment Innovation Survey and other sources. This research will provide insights into the economic impacts of innovation and the role of design in entrepreneurial activities."
