abstract: "While the development of robotic technology is rapidly progressing, the diffusion of technology has been uneven and relatively slow. The disparities in robot adoption rates between large-, and Small and Medium-sized Manufacturers (SMM)s are becoming a substantial issue in the U.S. However, there are surprisingly few empirical studies highlighting such imbalance. To increase understanding of robot diffusion, this study seeks to contribute empirical evidence of factors that influence SMMs' decisions on robot adoption. We plan to incorporate various datasets, including microdata from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and Annual Business Survey (ABS), as well as Real-Time Labor Market Information (RTLMI), to build a comprehensive dataset for multi-level analysis. Using the integrated dataset, we will 1) evaluate the robotic data collected in ASM and ABS, 2) examine establishment- and regional-level factors that influence robot adoption, and 3) investigate cross-interaction between firm sizes and regional characteristics. We expect to find regional advantages that play a critical role in facilitating robot adoption and SMMs are more susceptible to such influence. As the first robot adoption study conducted with a large-scale sample of U.S. manufacturers, this study is expected to offer the necessary knowledge for developing a supportive industrial policy."
