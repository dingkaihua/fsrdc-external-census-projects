abstract: "The research we propose in this project centers on the definition of oil and gas involved areas along the coast of Gulf of Mexico. Previous research has necessarily relied on publicly available data sources such as household census PUMS (public-use microdata samples) files, (STF files) summary tape files, economic censuses, and County Business Patterns data. For public data of this sort, geographic specificity is a serious concern.  In the case of Gulf of Mexico oil and gas involvement, delineations have been based on counties (parishes).  Coastal counties and parishes can be quite large in land area.  As such, county-based involvement schema can be less than precise.  The internal files available to us at the Census Bureau are the microdata (household-level and establishment-level) which underlie the public-use data that are widely published.  The internal microdata code residential geography to the block level (population censuses) and the tract level (economic censuses). Place of work geography is coded to the tract level as well.  As such, we are in position to specify with geographic precision those land areas along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico that exhibit significant involvement in the oil and gas industries.  In doing so, we will conduct analysis of significance to the Minerals Management Service.  We would like to conduct the initial phase of the project at CES headquarters.  We would like to have the option of moving the project to Carnegie Mellon University or Chicago (should an RDC open there) for the later phases of the project."
