abstract: "This project explores issues of firm expansion. Those address the following: what factors determine the firms that will expand; the underlying reasons for expansion (e.g., efficiency vs. market power); the manner of expansion (intensive or extensive, acquisition or building new); the choice of whom to acquire, if that is the preferred expansion mode; and the impact on other players in the market, be they competitors or consumers. Focus is on expansion along the extensive margin, that is, through the purchase of existing establishments or the building of new ones. For data reasons, the project concentrates on manufacturing establishments, but some analyses will also be done for non-manufacturing sectors. The Longitudinal Business Database will be tied to production information from the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Sur-vey of Manufactures, and the Commodity Flow Survey. In its examination of firm expansion patterns, the project focuses on examining changes in linkages between establishments and firms during changes in owner-ship and on changes in establishment employment, payroll, and revenues as establishments and firms expand. Additionally, this project will inform the Census Bureau about supply chains within industries and how e-business impacts supply chain relationships."
