abstract: "Hurricane Katrina wrought major damage to housing across the New Orleans area.  Five years later, recovery remained spotty.  Over 100,000 residents had not returned to the city and in some neighborhoods physical reconstruction remained incomplete despite significant resources having been dedicated to recovery.  The 2009 American Housing Surveyâ€™s special post-Katrina sample for metropolitan New Orleans allows researchers to understand better the critical factors in recovery for housing and households.  This project uses American Housing Survey (AHS) data to address questions of vulnerability to and resilience after a major natural disaster event.  The 2009 AHS special examination of post-Katrina New Orleans provides a significant opportunity to analyze vulnerability and recovery, providing new information to policy makers about how better to prepare for and respond to such events.  This study analyzes pre-Hurricane Katrina conditions, disaster damage, and post-Katrina recovery.  It focuses on repair and re-occupancy of housing units by their original inhabitants to address the multiple dimensions of vulnerability, considering how household, housing unit, and neighborhood characteristics affect recovery.  The analysis employs multi-level modeling to distinguish effects of different facets of vulnerability, and estimates the contribution of neighborhood status to housing recovery over and above household factors."
