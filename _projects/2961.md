abstract: "This project will provide original analyses of the impact of school desegregation court orders on the health and mortality of Black Americans. This project will therefore use Census Bureau data to study an important historical policy change of contemporary relevance due to concerns that school districts are once again often segregated. The project aims to both (1) evaluate the total long-run impact of school desegregation orders on the health outcomes and mortality of Black Americans; and (2) assess the role of potential mechanisms - such as changes in educational attainment or income that resulted from desegregation - for any observed effects. The desegregation plans studied in this project began after Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and were rolled out throughout the 1980s as civil rights groups led efforts to force desegregation plans in school districts. The primary significance of the proposed study is therefore to link data on school desegregation exposure, long-run health outcomes, and shorter run economic and educational outcomes to allow for a detailed analysis of desegregation's health effects and potential economic mechanisms for these effects."
