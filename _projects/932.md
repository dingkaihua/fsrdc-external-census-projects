abstract: "This research examines the long-run effects of positive shocks to prenatal health on adult outcomes for cohorts born in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. This research uses data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program linked to the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Current Population Survey (CPS) to analyze how the implementation of the Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in the 1970's, the reduction of maternal smoking during pregnancy following the publication of the 1964 Surgeon General Report, and the reduction of prenatal exposure to air pollution following the Clean Air Act of 1970 have impacted numerous later-life measures of adult well-being such as health, income, educational attainment, and characteristics of the neighborhood of residence. The findings will shed light on whether the "fetal origins hypothesis", which postulates an important link between prenatal health and adult well-being, holds for the current adult population in the United States."
