abstract: "This project studies the link between firm-level growth and the structure of firms' debt, using the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) of manufacturing firms. Benefits to the Census Bureau include the construction of time series moments of QFR variables that address issues raised by firm reclassification across asset size bins, as well tabulations of the QFR using an alternative size criterion (sales)."
