abstract: "It is well established that there are large differences in productivity across firms, industries, and countries. Motivated by this fact, the purpose of this project is to use the Census of Manufactures (from 1963, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002) and the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (1973-2001) to develop a methodology for two new series for potential public release. These series help shed light on the underlying sources of productivity differences. First, for 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and 5-digit North American Industry Classification System industries, and for state and metropolitan geographic areas, we will construct and document industry series on the quality of products made. This quality index will exploit the unit price data provided for many of the 7-digit SIC products in the Census of Manufactures to measure the extent to which differences in productivity across establishments show up as differences in product quality. Our second contribution will be to provide new geographic area and industry series on the extent to which factor inputs are misallocated across plants in a geographic area or in a given industry. This “inefficiency” index will measure the potential gains in output if factor inputs were to be allocated efficiently across plants in the industry and area."
