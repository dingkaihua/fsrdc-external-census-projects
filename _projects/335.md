abstract: "The proposed project uses the 1990 Decennial Census Long Form Data for California to investigate the consequences of barriers to sorting, such as availability of houses and transaction costs, in the housing market equilibrium and its effects on the valuation of school quality. It builds on research by Bayer, McMillan, and Rueben. The methodology is based on the estimation of random coefficients multinomial logits, where I examine how different choice sets affect household sorting, after accounting for transaction costs, and modeling household mobility explicitly (mobility as a probability of moving to a different house unit). The inclusion of this extra modeling will permit the estimation of unbiased probabilities of households choosing a certain house/neighborhood. Also, the new models make it possible to identify the characteristics of individuals most affected by barriers to sorting. Only with such information can one understand how individual preferences determine location decisions and how important school quality is in determining housing choices within a heterogeneous population. Hypothesis testing will be performed on the average marginal willingness to pay for school quality estimates, as well as on the heterogeneity in individual preferences estimates. The research is feasible given the richness of the Decennial Census Long Form Data. These data provide the geographic location of each household’s place of residence at the Census block level, allowing the choice sets to be defined precisely in terms of house attributes/neighborhood characteristics. Also, with the Decennial Census Long Form Data, I can accurately assign a public school to each house unit, providing a school quality measure that will be extensively used in the estimations. This research yields benefits to the Census Bureau that fall into four areas: (1) compiling a series of external datasets to be linked to the 2000 Decennial Census Long Form Data; (2) analyzing measurement errors in the self-reported ‘travel time to work’ variable; (3) providing comparisons between allocation methods for the ‘travel time to work’ variable; (4) providing an algorithm for linking Census data with data from other sources, with an application to public school data. I will also attempt to create weights for school attendance areas and estimates relating school-age children and households with children in school."
