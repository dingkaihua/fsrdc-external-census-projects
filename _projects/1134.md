abstract: "In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis of 2008, employment growth in the U.S. economy was unusually sluggish compared to other postwar recessions of similar magnitude. In standard models in economics, the speed of firms' adjustment to shocks is presumed to have significant influence on the aggregate rate of employment growth. However, there has been surprisingly little empirical work investigating the determinants of flexibility firms have in responding to shocks. In the wake of the recent recession there have been controversial debates about the power of announcements to stimulate current investment activity and employment: Under which conditions will firms react swiftly to news about the economy? Along which margins are establishments adjusting: do they change prices, employment, investment, or product variety and technology, or do they simply enter or exit altogether? And how important for a speedy adjustment are determinants which are internal to the firm, such as technology or forecasting ability, as opposed to market distortions which are external to firms? This project will produce estimates that characterize dynamic business responses to forecastable shocks and will evaluate whether measures of dynamic adjustment responses forecast exit patterns especially of small employer and non-employer businesses. Based on these new estimates, the researchers will make recommendations about extending the set of variables to include establishment-level adjustment speed to forecasted shocks, which might help to predict current size and the likelihood of transition from a single-establishment to a multi-establishment firm.
