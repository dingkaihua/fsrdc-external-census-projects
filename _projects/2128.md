abstract: "A growing literature highlights the huge dispersion in productivity across establishments in the US. New research demonstrates that resource reallocation is a key factor in growth and explains much of the variation in productivity. Despite a mounting recognition of the importance of asset allocation, existing measures of asset allocation rely on aggregate estimates that do not track how individual assets change hands and are ultimately reutilized. In this project, we construct new measures of the real estate assets used by firms from purchased US Postal Service data linked with restricted data from the LBD, SSEL, and economic surveys/censuses. We then use these measures to evaluate asset utilization and reallocation in the economy to determine how assets are used or redeployed following a variety of economic shocks, and how reallocation activity affects other measures of performance and economic activity with fixed effects models."
