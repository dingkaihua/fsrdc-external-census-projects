abstract: "In this project, we propose to investigate the interplay between the firms' price- and wage-setting behavior and supply chains, and examine the implications of this interaction for inflation dynamics and the associated wage-price spirals. We construct a novel firm-level wage and price data by merging the wage data from the Census Bureau, the price data underlying  producer price indexes (PPIs) and import/export price indexes (IPP) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as well as the dataset on supply chains collected based on SEC filings. We plan to study the following questions: How do pandemic-induced changes in a supplier-firm's price-setting behavior affect the price-setting behavior of its customer-firms? How do changes in the structure of supplier-customer networks impact price-setting behavior of firms in supply-chain networks? How do price pressures impact wage-setting behavior of firms in supply-chain networks? The answers to these questions help us better understand how price pressures transmit through supply chains and helps us resolve the debate on causation between wage and price inflation."
