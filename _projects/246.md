abstract: "This project will accomplish two research objectives. First, it will revise a paper produced as part of the earlier project “Corporate Diversification and Quasi-Diversification: Causes and Consequences” (LA 99-05). The paper examines whether the finding of a diversification discount in U.S. stock markets is only an artifact of the use of Compustat segment data. Using a common methodological approach on a sample of firms which exhibit a diversification discount according to segment data, it finds that, when BITS data are used, diversified firms actually trade at a significant average premium. The second research objective of this project is to revise and conclude the author’s earlier efforts to match establishment-level data from the Census Bureau’s Business Information Tracking Series (BITS) to firm-level data from Standard and Poor’s Compustat. The resulting database provides information on the financial characteristics of public U.S. firms and a more objective and detailed breakdown of their activities by industry than that offered by segment-level data. The merged database is therefore an extremely rich source of information that can be used to investigate a variety of topics. The author will be making available to the Center for Economic Studies the matching file that will enable future researchers at the Center to recreate the merged dataset, together with a document that will describe in detail the process followed to create that matching file."
