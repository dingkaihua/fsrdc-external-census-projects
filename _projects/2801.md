abstract: "We will study the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. businesses. We will link a variety of Census datasets, including the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the Small Business Pulse Survey (SBPS) with external data on participation in government support programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). 
In addition to studying SBPS survey nonresponse, we will ask several questions. First, what were the productivity effects of the pandemic? Our empirical approach will mirror Baily et al. (1992) and Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2001). We expect that the pandemic will have increased the entry and exit rates of firms, particularly at the lower end of the productivity distribution, although government support programs may have lessened the degree of reallocation.
Second, we will study the effects of the pandemic, such as on revenues, investment, and participation in government programs, on different types of firms, such as differences across industries, size, and owner characteristics. This analysis will use OLS and IV regressions, where we will instrument participation in government programs with measures of pre-existing banking market characteristics. We expect that the effects of the pandemic will be highly heterogenous, with firm productivity and access to capital playing important roles.
Third, we will study how businesses respond to restrictions on business activity using a discontinuity approach around the borders of states with different levels of restrictions. We expect that restrictions likely negatively affected business operations, although these effects likely varied depending on factors such as industry and government program participation."
