abstract: "The overall goal of this research is to effectively categorize and describe the Asian immigration population by migration status in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), to compare across their demographic characteristics, economic status, and employment patterns. No study to date has exclusively studied and described the detailed migration status of Asian immigrants in representative data sources. First, this project will compare imputation methods in the restricted-use SIPP dataset to identify an optimal approach to estimate migration status (legal permanent residents, legal non-immigrants, and remaining other non-LPRs within non-citizens). Second, this project will describe the demographic, economic, and health insurance characteristics of the Asian immigration population by migration status, both nationally and in California. "
