abstract: "The primary objective of this project  is to undertake an analysis of the U.S. dairy processing sector.  We intend to examine the extent to which their exists significant economies of scale, factor substitution and the role of technological change in the evolution of this industry over the 1962-1997 period.  To our knowledge, there has not been any firm-level analyses of this industry.  Subject to data availability we will examine the structure of cheese manufacture, butter production, fluid milk bottlers and manufacturers of dried milk products. The proposed econometric analysis will be based on a neoclassical cost function model of production."
