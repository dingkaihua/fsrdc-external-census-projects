abstract: "Early life experiences have the potential to affect the health and wellbeing of people many decades later. Positive health shocks during childhood can result in people being healthier later in life and thus less reliant on healthcare services or government social safety net programs. Conversely, adverse health shocks early in life might permanently decrease human capital and result in long run social costs. This project studies how childhood exposure to radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear testing and the Salk poliomyelitis vaccine trial in the 1950s have affected the health and wellbeing of aging populations. Both atmospheric nuclear testing conducted in Nevada and the Salk vaccine trial plausibly affected millions of people during the 1950s. Much of the affected populations have retired or are nearing retirement age and thus are relying more on U.S. social safety net programs. If past public health shocks affected the human and health capital of a large cohort of people, then it is plausible that these shocks are affecting the contemporary wellbeing and the costs of social safety net programs.  Using county level records estimating radioactive fallout exposure, I can link individuals to measures of exposure by birthplace and birth data. By comparing more and less exposed populations, I can quantify the health and human capital effects of both prenatal and childhood exposure to radioactive fallout. In contrast to atmospheric nuclear testing, the Salk polio vaccine trial of 1954 potentially led to long-run improvements in public health. While immunity to the poliovirus likely benefited many, it is plausible that that the trial itself may have altered public opinions and behaviors regarding healthcare investments. The project will identify individuals exposed to the vaccine trial and compare their long-run health, human capital, and program participation with persons who were not directly exposed to the vaccination trial."
