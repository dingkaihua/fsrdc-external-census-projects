abstract: "The fundamental causes of the American Baby Boom are not well-understood. In particular, standard theories fail to predict its timing. I propose to shed new light on the origins of the Baby Boom by exploring a new channel: the effect of labor union membership on fertility. Following the passage of the 1935 Wagner Act, union membership rates more than tripled, and by the peak of the Baby Boom one-third of American workers were members of a labor union. Using the Decennial Census and novel historical data sources of union membership, I will test whether unionization is causally related to completed fertility and birth rates during this period."
