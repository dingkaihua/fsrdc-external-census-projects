abstract: "This project will investigate the relationship between individual social and civic engagement (referred to as “social capital”) at a narrowly defined level of geography and individual labor market outcomes, migration decisions, and survey return/response rates. The first research question will investigate the relationship between a person's level of social and civic engagement and his/her labor market decisions/outcomes. One question is whether social engagement and labor force participation are substitute or complementary activities. The second research question focuses on the relationship between a person's social capital and individual migration decisions, and how a person's propensity to move might be related to the person's propensity to engage in social and civic activities.
