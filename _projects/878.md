abstract: "Employers and employees face economic incentives that encourage health insurance provision through the workplace. This project will use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) augmented with other federal and non-federal data sources to analyze employer behavior regarding the provision of health insurance. Specifically, we will estimate the net advantage or disadvantage to private sector employers of keeping or dropping health insurance under any changing economic incentives created by reforms to health care. The “net advantage” of dropping health insurance reflects an establishment's assessment of the potential value of exchange-based premium assistance credits (subsidies) that its workers could get if the employer dropped coverage; the value of the tax subsidy associated with offering health insurance; and the cost of the employer-shared responsibility requirement that an employer would incur if it dropped coverage. In addition, we will quantify the relationship between an employer's propensity to offer insurance and the tax price of insurance among workers in the establishment, characteristics of the establishment and its workforce, labor market conditions, and competition in the market for health insurance by modeling an employer's decision to offer health insurance. Finally, we will predict how economic incentives facing employers will alter their incentives to provide health insurance. 
The MEPS-IC are critical for analyzing the proposed issues as no other nationally representative data set exists that contains detailed information on health benefit offerings, premiums, and workforce composition of U.S. establishments. The resulting analyses will inform the Census Bureau about the relation between health insurance provision by employers and the economic incentives that businesses face, which are driven in large part by the characteristics of their workers and their families. We will develop methods to enhance the information contained in the MEPS-IC with respect to measuring an establishment's workforce composition, including estimating the wage distribution of full-time workers within establishments who are most likely to be eligible for health insurance. We will also develop methods to facilitate a comparison of the distribution of wage income reported for workers relative to the distribution of household income by workers in establishments. These analyses can facilitate a more complete assessment of employers' changing incentives to offer health insurance and they can test the sensitivity of how particular assumptions about employer behavior affect the offering decision. The proposed research also will benefit the Census Bureau by providing population estimates of establishment offers of health insurance under existing economic incentives and offers a flexible model for understanding how employer behavior may change in light of new economic incentives (e.g., differences by state or under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010)."
