abstract: "The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of production factors' aging on the technology adoption of a firm. We plan to show that technology adoption is slower for a firm with older labor and old capital. To do so, we will examine new patents in the same industry to analyze the productivity difference of establishments with older production factors compared to establishments with younger production factors. We will also investigate the reaction of firms to delayed technology adoption. If firms fail to promptly renew the factor structure, they will suffer from decreased earnings and firm value. Eventually, the age of production factor will work as a risk characteristic of the firm and is priced in the stock market. Considering the destructive effects of automation innovation on the factor market, the effect of automation will be evaluated separately. This research will contribute to the literature by providing foundations for life-cycle theories of corporate policies in the aging society."
