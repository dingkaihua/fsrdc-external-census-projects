abstract: "This project describes and estimates a model of neighborhood choice in which environmental health risks vary across neighborhoods. The model is estimated using household-level data from a restricted version of the U.S. Decennial Census 1990 and 2000. The analysis focuses on neighborhoods near waste incinerators, coal-burning power plants, nuclear power plants, and other facilities. The empirical strategy exploits the opening and closing of these facilities to control for unobserved differences across neighbor-hoods. The first objective of this project is to generate new estimates about the causal impact of environmental health risks on geographic mobility and home values, with particular emphasis on patterns for different ethnic and racial groups. A second objective is to assess the environmental-related questions in the American Housing Survey (AHS) and to make available a database of facilities that can be merged with the AHS."
