abstract: "This study will look at how neighborhoods change over time, how this change affects residents’ perceptions and actions, and how residents’ actions impact on the neighborhood change. Using longitudinal data, it will test two competing theories explaining the relationship between residential instability and crime rates in neighborhoods. I will also test whether the social capital in an area (embodied in social networks, voluntary organizations, and various other institutions) can ameliorate negative impacts on the neighborhood and prevent the downward spiral experienced by some neighborhoods. But to understand how neighborhoods change it is necessary to have an accurate measure of neighborhood quality. A key component of this study will be determining the usefulness of the subjective measures regarding neighborhood satisfaction, characteristics, and crime provided by respondents to the American Housing Survey (AHS) survey. I will combine a rich data set of measures culled from official sources with the AHS subjective responses in 21 metro areas as well as the three national neighbors subsamples (from 1985, 89, and 93). I am collecting a unique longitudinal data set of crime rates for small areas within particular cities. These data will allow me to assess the reliability of respondents to the questions about perceived crime. This will provide valuable information for future researchers who wish to use the subjective responses to the AHS for inferring the objective crime rates in neighborhoods. In addition, by linking in the official data I have collected with the AHS, I will be able to determine the sources of neighborhood satisfaction. This will provide insight if there are important neighborhood dimensions of neighborhood satisfaction that the AHS is not currently asking respondents, and provide guidance for future modification of the survey instrument."
