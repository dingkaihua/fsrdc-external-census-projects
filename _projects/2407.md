abstract: "This project will study the effects of foreign production on U.S. prices and firm behavior. More specifically, the researchers will examine the importance of multinational activity, changes in economic conditions abroad, and the entry of foreign exporters into the U.S. market on U.S. prices, including both trade prices and domestic prices, and U.S. firm outcomes, such as employment, exporting status, productivity, and market share. The project will benefit the Census Bureau by improving the quality of the underlying data to identify U.S. establishments that are part of a foreign trade zone, by documenting the amount of measurement error in the related party variable in the trade data, and by accounting for the role of mergers and acquisitions in the trade data.  The project will use the Annual Survey of Manufactures, Census of Manufactures, Commodity Flow Survey, Compustat-SSEL Bridge, Foreign Trade Data - Export, Foreign Trade Data - Import, Lexis-Nexis Directory of Corporate Affiliations - SSEL Bridge, Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database, and Standard Statistical Establishment List / Business Register."
