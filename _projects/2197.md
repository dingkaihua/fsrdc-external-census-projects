abstract: "This project will examine the effect of various programs, policies, and health services that target breastfeeding on women's return to work after childbirth. Our analysis will use temporal and geographic variation in these factors to examine how changes in breastfeeding and breastfeeding support--for example, workplace regulations requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodation to express breastmilk during the workday--affect mother's labor market outcomes, such as employment, hours, and occupation. The primary empirical methods used will be event study and difference-in-difference models; we will also explore instrumental variables models to address the endogeneity of local health services. The analysis will rely on two categories of variation: one, state-level changes in polices and programs that should affect mothers of infants (such as workplace laws mentioned above), with some sub-state analysis conducted to address heterogeneity issues; and two, narrow geographic variation that examines the local availability of breastfeeding support services, including the location of WIC offices, lactation support providers, and breastfeeding initiation rates at the nearest hospital.
