abstract: "This research addresses the crucial question of how spatial unevenness in the distribution of jobs and workers contributes to labor market inequality. Specifically, this research measures the effect of spatial accessibility on the probability of employment and on wages for different racial and ethnic groups, as well as by sex.  Proponents of the spatial mismatch hypothesis invoke spatial accessibility as a root cause of the racial gap in employment between blacks and whites.  Spatial accessibility—or inaccessibility—also has been used as an explanation for the gender-gap in wages by the spatial entrapment hypothesis. Considerable debate surrounds these two hypotheses, primarily as a result of widely different methodological approaches given limited data on job location. This research empirically tests the implications of spatial accessibility for different race and gender groups using individual-level data that includes tract of work information. Such data allows a robust test of spatial accessibility while controlling for important individual characteristics, such as human capital. The analysis consists of two parts. First, this study considers the effects of residential location relative to jobs on employment. Specifying a logit model that includes a measure of spatial accessibility to jobs matched to an individual’s skills as an independent variable provides a measure of the effect of residential location relative to jobs on the probability of employment. Second, this research examines the effect of residential location relative to jobs on wages. Regressing wages on a set of variables that includes a measure of spatial accessibility tests the wage effect of spatial job accessibility. The proposed research contributes to debates about the role residential and job location play in labor market inequality by measuring the effect of spatial accessibility on employment and wages using the one-in-six sample of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. Examination of this data allows analysis of the spatial pattern of allocation/imputation of tract of work data based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, industry, and occupation, as well as the potential documentation of new allocation methods."
