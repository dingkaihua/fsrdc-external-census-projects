abstract: "This project will use the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and Longitudinal Business Database to shed light on the underlying sources of innovation, where innovation potentially comes from three sources. In particular, firms grow when they improve on products made by other firms (creative destruction), when they innovate on products that they currently produce (own innovation), and when they invent brand new products (new varieties). Each mechanism will leave specific telltale signs in the microdata. In particular, they will generate different patterns of firm exit with respect to the size of the firm, for the number of products made by the firm, the volatility of firm growth, the size distribution of firms, and how the size distribution evolves with firm age. The researchers will use these moments from the microdata to estimate the magnitude of each of the three growth mechanisms."
