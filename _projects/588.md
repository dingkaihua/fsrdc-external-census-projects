abstract: "This project centers on the journey-to-work data from the American Community Survey to analyze the impact of population growth, especially for special population groups, on demand for transportation services.  Focus is on seasonality in these data and the feasibility/reliability of producing small area estimates (e.g., transportation analysis zones) using these data. The project will produce estimates of social, economic, and demographic differentials among special population groups (specifically those that relate to transportation demand). It will inform the Census Bureau about the seasonality of the underlying data used in these analyses. It examines the feasibility and reliability of producing small area estimates, like transportation analysis zones, that are useful to the transportation planning community. The research focuses on the differences in commuting behavior among the major population groups and how these patterns may change in the long term and the short term through seasonal cycles. These research questions have major implications for decision makers and transportation planners."
