abstract: "The proposed research program will develop and implement methods to estimate hedonic price supply and demand models applied to two important classes of empirical economic issues where hedonic models are applicable, real estate and labor markets. Since these models include attributes that are highly location specific, this project will also develop and implement methods to link the micro-observations of Census Bureau datasets to micro-observations of other Census Bureau datasets and to external datasets. This linkage will be based on locations of the micro-observations, i.e., their physical geospatial proximity with each other, and will be performed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). These two activities, development of hedonic prices and geospatial linking, form the principal benefits to the Census Bureau. In addition, through the application of these models to specific topics of interest, we will also generate bene-fits to specific Census Bureau surveys, such as the American Housing Survey and other surveys used through the course of the project. In order to apply hedonic models to study location issues, datasets containing highly detailed geographic information and robust methods for establishing the geospatial relationships are required. The project will use GIS modeling tools to create the necessary statistical measures of collocation that will enable us to examine specific topics using the hedonic approach. In addition, part of the proposed research will develop new methodological approaches that address some of the theoretical and empirical shortcomings with the classical hedonic model. The topics that will be studied in this project include: an analysis of residential real estate markets; an analysis of school quality, education, location, and neighborhood effects; commercial real estate markets and community economic development; and a hedonic analysis of labor markets.  This research program is focused not only on developing the data sources and tools needed to apply the hedonic approach to these questions but also on testing our progress with a series of interrelated topical studies that focus on some of these aspects. While the longer term goal is a more integrated assessment of the hedonic values across all of these factors, we begin with examining several more “manageable” sized research topics in this general area by incrementally developing the data and tools needed to measure the aforementioned community factors and estimate the hedonic prices associated with them. In doing so we also expect to address some important social science research questions with better data and better methodology."
