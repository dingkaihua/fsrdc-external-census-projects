abstract: "The project will investigate transitions between wage employment, self-employment, and employer entrepreneurship, relating those to the person's family situation and household composition. The researchers will examine data quality by linking individual level earnings history from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Employment History Files (EHF) and US Indicators file to the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), and contrasting the assigned "employment type" to self-reported information in the Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The project will analyze the drivers of employment transition in the longitudinal transition history by examining the timing relative to changes in the family composition and other household events. A careful examination of the connection between self-employment and entrepreneurship outcomes and circumstances surrounding entry will be completed to understand the gender differences in firm survival, growth, VC funding, IPO, and innovation. The project will further investigate the relationship between entrepreneurship and socio-economic mobility by contrasting the changing earnings rank of individuals and their children over time and across the types of career transitions completed. Finally, the role of public policies as well as individual, occupation, and firm characteristics will be assessed when evaluating the heterogeneity of the career transitions and entrepreneurial outcomes across groups defined by demographics, occupation traits, firm types, and relevant public policies."
