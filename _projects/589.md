abstract: "This project examines the relationship between nursing home labor turnover and retention rates and the quality of care provided in nursing homes across the United States and determine how those relation-ships are altered in the face of changes in state mandates affecting nursing staffing or wages. Several Census Bureau datasets provide longitudinally linkable information about staff turnover and retention in all U.S. nursing homes.  Census datasets for the years 1990â€“2006 are linked with the Online Survey Certification of Automated Reporting (OSCAR) annual data on nursing home structure, staffing and regulatory compliance, facility case mix acuity and resident quality indicators, and a survey of state regulations and initiatives regarding nursing home staffing standards and wages. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the quality of census nursing home data as collected in the economic census and business register; to examine the relationship between nursing home labor turnover, wages, and the quality of care provided in nursing homes; and to deter-mine how those relationships are altered in the face of state legal changes affecting staffing or wage mandates."
