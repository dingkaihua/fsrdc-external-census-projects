abstract: "How do firms of varying sizes, ages and industries, respond to changes in patent legislation? Innovation is the primary driver of economic growth, and understanding how firms exploit growth options is critical to the health of the economy. Utilizing the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey, the Longitudinal Business Database and the Annual Survey of Manufactures, I will examine how disclosure changes affect firms' incentives to innovate. I will employ trans-log and difference-in-differences methodologies to estimate pre- and post-levels of R&D-related investments and outcomes (i.e. patent count and patent citations). First, it is hypothesized there is a differential effect on a firm's willingness to invest in innovation (i.e. log of R&D related expenditures) modulated by the firm's size (i.e. log of sales) between the pre- and post-periods. Furthermore, it is hypothesized the coefficient on the logarithm of sales is negative--the rationale for this is that larger firms will increase their reliance on smaller firms due to the former's ability to technologically "leap-frog" smaller rivals in the innovation process. Lastly, it is hypothesized that smaller, innovative firms (proxied by number of patents and citations) will experience an increase in their propensities to merge with larger, older firms since smaller firms are unable to devote the same resources as their larger and older rivals in subsequent patent races."
