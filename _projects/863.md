abstract: "The project entails systematic econometric modeling of a number of freight demand processes: freight generation, distribution, mode/vehicle choice. The goals are to: (1) test the usefulness and practicality of using these models to identify outliers in the Census Bureauâ€™s Commodity Flow Survey and improve sample design, and (2) provide the transportation planning community with a set of basic freight demand models to support the planning process, infrastructure renewal decisions, and analyses of policies to spur economic activity.
