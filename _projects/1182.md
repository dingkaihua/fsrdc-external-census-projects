abstract: "This project will use various Census Bureau datasets to examine how social and technological change in geographic space have a bearing on the performance of businesses â€“ particularly startups. For example, how have changes in neighborhood characteristics impacted distributional outcomes for minority and female owned businesses, and how have these businesses impact minority and female employment. This project will also investigate the quality, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of Census Bureau data on firm age and minority and female firm ownership of U.S. companies by making statistical comparisons to Dunn and Bradstreet (D&B) data."
