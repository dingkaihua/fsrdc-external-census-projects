abstract: "This research will measure the extent of elderly poverty by using information contained in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data linked to Supplemental Security Record ﬁ les. The project uses supplemental security income (SSI) rules and administrative data on beneﬁts and SSI eligibility to construct measures of earnings and eligibility for SIPP sample members and contrast these measures to those obtained from public-use data. Preliminary estimates suggest that measurement error in income and assets in the public-use SIPP is substantial among the low-resource elderly. Moreover, this measurement error translates directly into errors in estimates of the size of the SSI-eligible population and the rate at which eligible individuals enroll in SSI. The potential beneﬁts of this study are to increase awareness of the quality of SIPP data, increase understanding of the sources of measurement errors in ﬁnancial resources, and prepare estimates of the characteristics of the population that are likely to be more accurate than those obtained from previous research using public-use data."
