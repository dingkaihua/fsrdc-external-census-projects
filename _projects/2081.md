abstract: "This project studies the determinants of firm location decisions, including both where to operate and, for multi-establishment firms, how to allocate workers across locations. New firms have to consider local labor market conditions, infrastructure, taxes, and the regulatory environment when deciding where to locate their production facilities. This is also relevant for existing firms as location decisions are not permanent and incumbents respond to changes in the economic environment in which they operate. The Census data show the size and location of establishments in each year, as well as firm identifiers. We can use this to analyze the yearly movement of establishments."
