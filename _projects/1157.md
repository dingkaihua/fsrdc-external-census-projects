abstract: "Demand for contextualized microdata has increased dramatically over the last decade and is expected to increase even more in years to come. The Census Bureau collects data to produce timely population estimates on demographic, social, housing, and economic characteristics for a broad spectrum of geographic areas in the United States and is therefore in a unique position to meet some of this demand. However, releasing geographic details in public-use microdata may increase the risk of disclosure. Current disclosure limitation practices involve suppressing geographic details for spatial units that fail to meet a predefined population threshold (e.g., 100,000). Users interested in studying persons nested within less-populated geographies (e.g., rural counties, tracts, block groups) must access restricted-use data through data enclaves. Neither of these approaches fully satisfies the growing demand for geographically-rich microdata that is being fueled by a variety of researchers, analysts, decision-makers, and administrators. To help alleviate barriers to use, this project will develop methodology that supports the efficient identification of sampling and database designs and associated masking techniques that allow more geographic detail to be released on microdata products, without increased disclosure risk or unnecessary survey costs. This research will use the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) data as the empirical foundation, with the aim of producing statistics that summarize findings from the evaluation of the methodology and broad guidelines derived from disclosure simulations, all of which are to be carefully constructed so as to ensure the confidentiality of the underlying data and disclosure practices."
