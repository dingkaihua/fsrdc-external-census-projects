abstract: "This project aims at improving understanding of neighborhood economic change by studying household residential choices and examining the circumstances under which households are willing to make moves into neighborhoods with incomes lower than their own. It will study whether and how these households diﬀer from house-holds making other types of residential choices and whether certain aspects of neighborhoods or their residents make such pioneering moves more attractive. The project will also investigate household exit decisions and examine whether mobility rates are higher in economically gaining neighborhoods. We will consider renters and low-income renters separately. The research will study other changes taking place in neighborhoods experiencing gains in income—such as whether housing costs increase and whether there are compensating changes in quality of the neighborhood, like increased satisfaction with neighbor-hood safety, schools, local transit, and availability of local businesses. The research will compare mobility rates and the prevalence of certain types of household turnover across different types of neighborhoods. A series of regression analyses will model pioneering moves, household exit, and various measures of household satisfaction by using the national and ﬁve metropolitan area versions of the American Housing Survey"
