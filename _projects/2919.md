abstract: "Despite ongoing efforts, enrolling and retaining a high proportion of eligible participants 
(coverage rate) in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has eluded federal administrators and their state partners for decades. In 2019 only 45% of children aged 1-4 years eligible for WIC nationally participated in the program. We will achieve two primary aims in this project. First, we will use WIC microdata from six states (2012-2022) and 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey (2012-2022) to estimate undercount-corrected, state-level WIC coverage rates by age and race/ethnicity. Second, we will use a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to model participation counts at the census tract level accounting for spatial measures of discrimination that address the intersectional experience of race, class, and migration."
