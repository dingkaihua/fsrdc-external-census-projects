abstract: "In the last twenty years, a large and growing multidisciplinary body of literature has established that the conditions to which a child is exposed in early life and even in utero have immediate and often lifelong consequences (Almond et al, 2017). Despite the rapid progress of this literature, several major questions about human capital development remain unanswered (Currie & Almond, 2011). Perhaps most importantly: can economic and health interventions mitigate the damages from harmful early-life shocks? This project attempts to answer this question by examining long-term outcomes of children whose families were exposed to one of three early-life shocks in the early- or mid-20th Century. The three shocks affect children's health, healthcare access, and finally the interaction between wealth and environmental hazards. To evaluate their impacts, we will utilize records from the Decennial Censuses, the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the Social Security NUMIDENT database. The Census products provide outcome and control variables, while the Social Security files provide detailed information on date and place of birth, which is used to identify treated individuals. The estimation strategy is a difference-in-differences approach, and the resulting analyses will show when early-life shocks matter most and how they potentially interact."
