abstract: "This research investigates the factors associated with the location and dynamics of Latino-owned businesses (LOB) and the effects of LOB on local economic performance, with comparisons to businesses owned by Asians, blacks, and native whites. Using data from the 2002 and 2007 Survey of Business Owners, this study examines the dynamics of LOB, measured in terms of business start-ups, growth, and closure using firm/establishments and employment, and examines the effects of LOB on income growth, employment growth, changes in poverty, and population growth in local communities in the United States.
