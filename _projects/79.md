abstract: "The aim of this research is to examine some of the key questions surrounding the effects of cultural policy.  Over the past decade, government funding for cultural institutions has undergone dramatic changes, most notably in the reductions of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding and in the shift away from federal funding to state and local funding. The consequences of these changes on cultural provision remain largely unknown. Turning to the demand side, cultural policy makers often argue that cultural projects have effects that extend beyond the audiences of the projects, and that significant spillovers to the local economy, in the form of lower crime rates, increased civic engagement, and a better citizenry generally, result. Again, most of these claims, though testable, have remained unexamined. In addition, this research on cultural policy ties into two distinct lines of ongoing research in economics, although the explicit consideration of cultural policy is novel. First, the project addresses the effects of different funding sources on the provision of public goods. Second, the project fits into the growing body of research on social interactions."
