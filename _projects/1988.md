abstract: "This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by expanding the understanding of how research and development (R&D) investments contribute to the productivity of firms--both the firms that undertake the investments directly as well as neighboring firms that benefit from spillover effects. Specifically, combining a unique data set of geocoded R&D labs with firm-level data from Compustat and restricted-use Census data at the firm- and establishment-level, this project will first describe how firms locate their R&D labs relative to their own production and administrative establishments as well as the labs of other firms. It will then estimate the impact of R&D labs, the locations and characteristics of those labs and the clusters in which the labs are located, and the position of labs within the production structure of the firm on total firm productivity. The researchers will test whether these estimates vary by industry, firm size, or presence of multiple labs within the firm. In addition, the researchers will use their proprietary data on R&D clusters and the strength of knowledge spillovers within them to produce population estimates of the impact of being located within R&D clusters or near the labs of other firms in oneâ€™s own industry. These estimates will help to form a more complete picture of our local and national innovation ecosystems. Given the well-established linkages between research and development (R&D), productivity, and economic growth, we believe that the results will be of broad application and interest.
The study will also provide a better understanding of how well establishments devoted to research and development are identified in the Census data. This is possible because our R&D establishment data is of very high quality. Being able to identify establishments as R&D-performing and having good detail as to the type of research performed there is essential for answering important questions related to the environment for innovation and firm production structures. When data on R&D are aggregated to the firm level as in the SIRD, this kind of analysis is impossible. We aim to discover just what is possible given the current structure of the Census data and what requires more detail with a view to informing future data collection efforts."
