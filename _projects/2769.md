abstract: "The neighborhood where one lives has been shown to have important impact on adults' and children's outcomes. And while much research has studied the impacts of neighborhood-level (place-based) treatments such as Empowerment Zones, housing demand shocks, or recession shocks on aggregate neighborhood outcomes, data limitations have made it difficult to study how these treatments affect incumbent neighborhood residents (Neumark and Simpson 2015). Yet answering this question is crucial to understanding the distributional consequences of these treatments and, for certain treatments, the effectiveness of potential policy responses. For example, the distributional consequences of a neighborhood-level treatment are very different if it improves aggregate labor market outcomes by improving employment and incomes of incumbent residents---particularly in low-income neighborhoods---or if it improves aggregate outcomes through displacement of incumbents and selective in-migration of employed, higher-income residents. Similarly, understanding the extent to which incumbent labor market improvements in a neighborhood might be offset by rising rents for incumbents (through rising in-migration) are also important for understanding the distributional consequences of place-based treatments.	

This project will study the effects of place-based treatments on neighborhoods, incumbent residents, and in-migration by leveraging unique features of the LEHD and Census Bureau data sets such as the Decennial Censuses, American Community Surveys (ACS), and Master Address File-Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF). Combining these data sets will provide detailed residential location information for millions of individuals; important outcomes such as employment and income, rents, and house values; and detailed demographic characteristics such as education levels. More specifically, the LEHD will provide longitudinal labor market outcomes for a much larger sample of individuals than is available in Census Bureau sources, which will be important for obtaining sufficiently precise estimates of spatial treatments and help with identification, for example through the inclusion of individual fixed effects in regression models."
