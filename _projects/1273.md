abstract: "This project investigates the effects of bargaining power and long-term relationships on price setting in producer markets. One set of questions centers on the effect of bargaining power on the average price level and the size and frequency of price changes. For example, are sellers with more bargaining power able to charge higher prices for the same product? Another set of research questions concerns the connection between the average length of a relationship and bargaining power. For example, do relationships characterized by asymmetric bargaining power become more stable over time? Using transaction-level trade data involving U.S. firms, this research identifies both the buyer and the seller firm for import transactions. This feature makes it possible to determine in the import data whether firms are in an ongoing relationship with each other and to assess their relative bargaining power. Bargaining power is estimated using proxies for firmsâ€™ size, the ease with which they can find an alternative trading partner for the same product, and the uniqueness of the product traded. "
