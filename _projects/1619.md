abstract: "Advancements in oil and gas drilling have led to a rapid expansion of shale energy production across the United States. While increased domestic energy production has important strategic implications for the country as a whole, the most profound impacts may be on the small towns and rural areas where the energy extraction is occurring. Much work has been done to estimate the economic and environmental impacts of shale energy development, yet little empirical work has assessed its impact on family outcomes and community demographic composition. We use restricted access American Community Survey microdata from 2006â€“2014 to estimated difference-in-differences models of shale energy development on family processes. Family outcomes of interest include fertility (marital and nonmarital), marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and migration. We do not expect shale development to have progressed long enough to have a measurable impact on overall fertility rates. However, nonmarital fertility is more closely associated with short-term individual level economic, so we expect shale development to significantly impact nonmarital fertility. "
