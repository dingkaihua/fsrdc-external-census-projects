abstract: "Recent contributions to the study of neighborhood gentrification remain heavily divided along methodological lines. Quantitative scholars consistently find little evidence of physical displacement within gentrifying areas, but are rarely able to assess the social impacts of gentrification on a wide scale. In this study, I aim to reconcile this gap through a two-step structural equation model and maximum likelihood regression analysis of the 2013 American Housing Survey's Neighborhood Social Capital variables. First, I assess how the multi-dimensional social costs and benefits of neighborhood change might be measured by incorporating these 21 variables into a latent factor analysis. Based on previous literature, I expect to find 5 latent measures of social experience. Then, utilizing longitudinal tract-level data from the American Community Survey, I classify each respondents' neighborhood as gentrifying or not. Using this classification as the primary independent variable, and controlling for various other household- and neighborhood-level factors from the AHS and ACS, I analyze the impact on the social experiences of long-time resident households. I expect to find that living in a gentrifying area is negatively associated with social capital, ties, and efficacy. Therefore, I refer to these impacts as the social costs of gentrification, and provide more nuance to quantitative research beyond the tracking of displaced households."
