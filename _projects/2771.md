abstract: "This project aims to identify and quantify monopsony power in labor markets - wage setting below marginal product - and to disentangle the sources of monopsony power. Specifically, it will quantify the roles of vertical and horizontal job differentiation and coordination among firms as sources of monopsony power in labor markets.  

This project will construct two primary analysis files. The first will use the ACS, National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN), and LEHD ICF to build a panel of Registered Nurses working in healthcare facilities. We link this panel to the LEHD ECF and Revenue-Enhanced LBD (LBDREV) to incorporate information about employers. We further enrich this file by linking in external data on healthcare facilities from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) and Provider of Services (POS) data, and California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Quarterly Financial and Utilization Reports. We additionally link in external data on inpatient claims at healthcare facilities from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project (HCUP). We use this panel to model several main outcomes of interest: wages, employment, and healthcare quality. 

The second file will link the LEHD ICF to the LEHD ECF and LBDREV to build a panel of individuals not restricted to individuals working in healthcare facilities. Individuals will be classified into labor markets defined by their education, experience, and wages rather than into a labor market defined by occupation as in the first file (Registered Nurses). This panel will also be used to model wages and employment as the main outcomes of interest. 

We will study the switching of individuals across employers and how this varies over time and across labor markets. We will decompose the variation in earnings of individuals within labor markets into: an individual's marginal product (individual fixed effect), a firm's wage premium (firm fixed effect), and time-variant individual controls following Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999). We will investigate how the total variance in earnings and how the variance attributed to each component (individual, firm, individual-firm match) varies over time."
