abstract: "In this research, we propose to investigate the impacts of globalization on the economy of Los Angeles and the wider region of Southern California. Our objective is to build analytical models of the interface between the local and the global economies in order to assess not just the immediate and most obvious impacts of globalization (such as changes in volume of trade and industrial specialization) but also to trace the indirect effects of globalization on the character and likely trajectory of local economic development. We plan to identify and to map the diverse weak and strong points of the local economy in relation to globalization processes, and to pinpoint their precise locations in Los Angelesâ€™ production system. Key industrial clusters will be identified, and the nature of their local and global linkages will be detailed. At the same time, we will look closely at the relationship between processes of globalization and the structure of local labor markets in Los Angeles. We intend to explore the local employment effects of globalization, first through analysis of changes in the supply and demand for workers with different skills, and second through investigation of the local labor market impacts of these changes on different segments of the population, especially African-Americans, Hispanics, women and immigrants. Labor markets across Southern California will be mapped in terms of their trade dependence."
