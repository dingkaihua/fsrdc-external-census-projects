abstract: "Little is known about the role of the local health care safety net in affecting employersâ€™ decisions to offer health insurance to their workers and the characteristics of the health insurance offered. The availability of safety net health care services may induce some firms not to offer health insurance to workers. Examples of firms that might be most likely to consider public sources of health care a potential substitute for privately-offered insurance include small firms with potentially high health insurance costs, firms hiring predominantly low-wage, low-skill workers, or firms in economically depressed areas. We propose to use Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) data for the years 1996-2000 combined with detailed measures of local health care facilities to examine the link between local safety net characteristics and employer-provided health insurance. By surveying approximately 25,000 firms annually regarding the characteristics of their health insurance, the MEPS-IC provides an ideal means of examining how local health care safety net characteristics affect the willingness of firms to offer health insurance. The detailed measures, the consistency of measurement over time, and the sample size will allow us to explore not only how the health care safety net affects whether employers offer health insurance but also the effects on the attributes of offered health insurance. We have identified three primary benefits to Census Bureau from our research. First, related to understanding the quality of the data, our research will involve different means of measuring the extent and characteristics of health insurance provision by employers for different subgroups of employers. Second, related to potential improvements in the quality of the data, our project involves a new approach to measuring the substitution of privately provided health care for publicly provided health care. Third, our project will enhance the MEPS-IC data by adding information from other data sources on local safety-net measures."
