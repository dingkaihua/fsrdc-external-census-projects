abstract: "How do education policies affect long-term life outcomes? From 1920 through 1980, there were approximately 1,600 openings of colleges (mainly two-year colleges) in the United States;  Between 1966 and 1980, 24 states introduced public funding for kindergarten; Between 1950 and 2000 in the U.S., over 120,000 schools were eliminated through consolidation and the average school size increased from 87 to 440 students. Each of these can be taken as an education policy natural experiment. That is, depending on location and date of birth, otherwise similar people were exposed to differences in college costs, access to public kindergarten, and school size. Using data from the Census Bureau, we will estimate the causal effect of these changes in education policy on important college and life outcomes, including educational attainment, family income, spouse educational attainment, migration, one's neighborhood characteristics as an adult, occupation, self-reported health status, wealth accumulation, premature adult mortality, the incidence of chronic disease, the educational attainment and longevity of one's children, and a number of outcomes relating to Covid-19 (in particular, the impact of Covid-19 at both the level of individuals and communities)."
