abstract: "The issue of defining “rurality” confuses, perplexes, and confounds nearly everyone who works with or studies rural populations in the United States. This is particularly true in statistical analyses and surveys such as the American Housing Survey (AHS). While the AHS is one of the most detailed and valuable sources of information on the nation’s housing stock, the survey has substantial shortcomings and limitations concerning its coverage and reporting of rural households. This project carries out a detailed geographical analysis of the current rural sample within the AHS. The project incorporates several different rural classifications into the survey to provide a more comprehensive assessment of residence patterns. The project will provide recommendations to improve the reliability and coverage of rural housing units for future surveys."
