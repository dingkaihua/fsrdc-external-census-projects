abstract: "This project will use micro data to document differences in establishment productivity and wages across space. A key focus will be to understand how these differences across establishments aggregate to determine regional differences in productivity and wages and how differences in regional productivity have been affected by changes in business dynamism, productivity growth and the geographic expansion of large firms. 

First, we will analyze the spatial differences in measures of business dynamism (such as the firm start up rate and exit rate, job creation and job destruction, and job separation and job finding rates). In previous work, we have documented that the relationship between business dynamism and city size (measured in population) has changed over time (Rubinton, 2020 under Census project 1975). In 1980, there was no relationship between dynamism and city size, while today big cities are much more dynamic than small cities. A key question will be to explore the causes of the changing patterns of business dynamism across space and the implications for productivity growth. 

Second, we will examine whether patterns of geographic convergence in productivity measures at the firm and establishment level have changed. Previous work has documented that income convergence between poor and wealthy regions in the United States has stopped after 1980. We will examine if the same patterns hold when looking at productivity and worker wages and then explore the underlying causes of the convergence patterns we document. Key areas of interest will be to examine the impact of technology diffusion and adoption, business dynamism, innovation and the geographic expansion of large firms on convergence in productivity and wages. 

Third, we will analyze the geography of technology diffusion and adoption. We will approach this question in several different ways. One method will be to look at whether industries are becoming more concentrated in space. We will look at which industry characteristics are important for determining their geographic concentration, such as age of the industry and measures of innovation or technology use. We will also examine technology diffusion more directly by examining whether local characteristics are important for determining whether or not firms adopt new technologies or whether or not they choose to innovate. We will ask how differences in technology diffusion and concentration impact regional differences in productivity and wages.

Fourth, we will examine whether patterns of selection have changed over time and across space and how this will matter for productivity growth. By selection, we mean the correlation between a firm's productivity and the probability that they exit the market. We will examine the factors that affect selection such as changes in congestion forces in frontier and lagging cities. We will then look at the effect of changes in selection for productivity growth and wage growth across space."
