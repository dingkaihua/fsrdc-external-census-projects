abstract: "This project will link firms in the Census of Manufactures to workers in the LEHD files in order to estimate production functions with labor disaggregated by gender and age.  The production functions will provide estimates of relative female productivity, which can be compared to relative female earnings, producing a better test of wage discrimination than is currently available.  We will determine whether disaggregating labor by age and gender improves the imputation of output. "
