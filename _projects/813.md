abstract: "A significant amount of the research on same-sex couples in the United States uses the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) as primary data sources. With the advent of legal marriage and other forms of recognition for these couples, interest in this group has intensified. This project will help determine if new procedures used in the 2008 ACS have improved the reliability and accuracy of data on same-sex couples, especially those where one partner is designated as a spouse. Beginning with the 2008 ACS, the Census Bureau now formally releases estimates of same-sex spouses (prior to this change, all same-sex partners designated as "husband" or "wife" were reclassified as "unmarried partners"). This only increases the urgency of assessing the reliability of the same-sex couple data, especially same-sex spouses.
Research suggests that a potentially large fraction of same-sex spouses may actually be comprised of different-sex spouses who miscode their sex. This project compares data from the 2007 and 2008 ACS to assess whether the new 2008 ACS data collection and editing procedures yield greater accuracy of responses and improve the reliability of the same-sex spousal data.  The primary research goal is to verify the extent of the measurement error using explicit identification of same-sex spouses. The use of data that includes original unedited responses to the household roster and variables associated with marital status and sex will allow a determination of whether the changes in the 2008 ACS data result in a more accurate enumeration of same-sex spouses. A second goal is to consider how state-level differences in responses to household roster and marital status questions may be associated with variation in the legal and social climate regarding recognition of same-sex relationships."
