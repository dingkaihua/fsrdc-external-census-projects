abstract: "Previous work has found that access to air conditioning dampens the relationship between heat and mortality, but it has used coarse, noisy measures of air conditioning adoption. We propose to develop annual, county-level measures of air conditioning adoption from the American Housing Survey. We will develop this measure by, first, estimating how air conditioning adoption depends, state by state, on respondents’ demographic characteristics and locations’ average weather and, second, combining these state-level estimates with county-level American Community Survey demographic information to calculate our county-level measure. We will use our new county-measure to improve previous estimates of the benefit of air conditioning, to estimate whether the availability of air conditioning makes weather forecasts more or less important for health outcomes, and to estimate whether the availability of air conditioning makes public health interventions more or less successful at reducing mortality from extreme heat."
