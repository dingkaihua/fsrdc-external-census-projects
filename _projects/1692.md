abstract: "This project examines the implications of top-coded earnings in the American Community Survey (ACS), March Current Population Survey (CPS), and Decennial Census. Research that relies on censored wage and salary earnings can yield potentially misleading results. For example, the measurement of income inequality may be distorted. Some researchers have addressed the top-coding issue by using non-public data to develop various alternative multipliers. This research improves this approach by developing multipliers that are demographic and region specific, since it is reasonable to expect that the earnings distribution varies across racial, gender, and education dimensions, and even across geographies. Comparisons to other approaches will be made."
