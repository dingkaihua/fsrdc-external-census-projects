abstract: "The proposed project seeks to exploit firm identifiers in establishment lists (the Standard Statistical Establishment Lists [SSELs] and the Census of Manufactures [CM], and possibly the Longitudinal Business Database [LBD]) to obtain measures of vertical integration within the manufacturing sector, and then apply these measures to empirical testing. We wish to measure the extent to which vertically integrated firms comprise industries and, in some cases, markets within industries. We will identify manufacturing establishments in vertically integrated firms by identifying plants whose owning firm also owns establishments in vertically linked industries. A comprehensive vertical integration measure would account for establishments in non-manufacturing sectors (e.g., when a manufacturer owns its retail outlets). If data limitations preclude this, it is still possible to obtain (more limited) “within-manufacturing” measures of vertical integration using only Longitudinal Research Database / CM data. We will conduct both industry-level and plant-level empirical analyses with these vertical integration measures. The proposed project will expectedly produce a number of benefits to the Census Bureau. We will construct and document an industry-level panel data set of vertical integration measures that can be used for a number of purposes. These include, but are not limited to, economic research into the interactions between integration and/or vertical mergers on input and output markets, comparison to more simply derived industry vertical integration measures (such as the ratio of value added to total output) to gauge the more simple measures’ accuracy, and analysis of legal policies that affect or are affected by the extent of vertical integration. These indices are novel and would be computed at an aggregate (industry) level; as such, they may be able to be made available to other researchers. Additionally, by investigating specifically the quality of the firm identifiers in the SSELs (which are of course of crucial interest to the success of this project), we will augment the considerable establishment-linking efforts that have been made to create the Longitudinal Business Database. Given the availability of establishment lists outside of the manufacturing sector, we will also be able to characterize the extent to which intersectoral ownership has changed over time. This may be of particular interest to the Census Bureau as its economic programs shift focus to non-manufacturing sectors. Finally, we will be able to provide estimates of a number of elasticities in the population. These include the responsiveness of vertical integration to technology and market structure (at both the industry and establishment levels), and the correlations between changes in vertical integration status and productivity. These estimates can be made exploiting both between-establishment differences and intertemporal variations within establishments."
