abstract: "Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are key investment and restructuring activities through which an economy reallocates resources across industries and over time, generating enormous wealth for investors and society as a whole. Despite decades of research, however, the question of where do the gains from mergers come from is still largely open. In fact, while academics and practitioners concur that a major source of gains is synergies, particularly cost savings, a precise quantification of these remains elusive. The primary objective of this project is to estimate the size of cost savings associated with employment restructuring in M&A. To do so, this research proposes a novel methodology of estimating the present value of cash flows from employment restructuring in M&A (“cost synergies”). This methodology carefully accounts for wage changes for employees present in the acquiring and target firms prior to and post M&A, and for wage changes associated with M&A-related layoffs, plant sales, and plant closures. This research takes into account the perpetual nature of the savings associated with labor restructuring and aims to examine the proportion of the contribution of perpetual labor savings to the change in the firm values surrounding M&A."
