abstract: "This study seeks to estimate the effects of the Great Depression through labor market channels in the short, medium, and long-run. The core of the project will examine labor market scarring. While the conditions at the time of labor market entry can have potentially lasting effects on career trajectories, life-course income, and the intergenerational transmission of wealth, recent work has focused on the relatively short-term consequences of graduating into a recession, largely because for recent downturns, timescale and privacy concerns together limit the data necessary for a comprehensive, life-course perspective. In this project, we overcome these limitations by turning to a setting that is both intrinsically important, and which allows us visibility into issues of long-run scarring: the Great Depression. Specifically, we estimate the age-at-exposure effect of the Great Depression over the life-course, and seek to understand how this key historical event shaped career trajectories, occupational mobility, and intergenerational opportunity."
