abstract: "This research will quantify short-run earnings volatility among low- and moderate-income families in California to estimate the incidence of family income changes and gauge implications for means-tested public insurance program eligibility. Moreover, this project will examine uptake of insurance programs and assess causes of disenrollment. To identify low- and moderate-income families in California, quantify earnings volatility, and assess public insurance eligibility, we will use quarterly earnings records contained in the Employment History File from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program linked to household records in the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, and person-level characteristics in the LEHD Individual Characteristics File. To this, we will link Medicaid Statistics Information Systems records, in order to capture spells of enrollment to Medicaid and SCHIP. With this we will generate measures of inappropriate disenrollment (program drop-out despite continuing eligibility) and legitimate disenrollment where return to these programs occurs in a short period of time (churning). In 2014, millions of Americans became eligible for government-subsidized health insurance programs where eligibility is determined by income falling within precisely defined ranges. We find it important to know whether eligible individuals have taken up benefits and, for families with more variable incomes, whether costs of maintaining enrollment results in an increased likelihood of churning—moving off and then back on a program within a short period of time—which is costly both for households and programs."
