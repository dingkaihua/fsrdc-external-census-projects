abstract: "There is evidence that firms require more skilled labor on the production line, production workers’ education levels are rising, and income inequality is growing, with higher returns to education even within production worker categories. An increase in skill demand may well arise from the greater computerization or technological improvements that are taking place within manufacturing. Greater skill demand may also arise from the adoption of more innovative human resource practices that put greater decision-making power in the hands of production workers. More specifically, as information technologies put more information in the hands of production workers, they are more likely to require greater reading, math, and problem-solving skills to make use of that information. In this project, we propose to test the hypothesis that greater levels of information technology, increased technological improvements, and innovative HR practices have elevated the skill requirements for production workers. This hypothesis will be tested using data from three industries—steel, fabricated metals, and medical instruments. We propose to undertake our own surveys of plants in these industries to gather data on the types of computerization or information technologies, the use of specific production technologies, human resource practices and skill requirements. The questions on these surveys will be specific to each industry. These data will be matched with data on wages, employment and value added from the LRD in order to build a panel data set of plant level practices and outcomes.
We propose to do regression analysis of the effects of new technologies on a number of different dependent variables: the average wage level; the wage ratio for production versus nonproduction employees; the number of production versus non-production employees; and measures of the types of skills demanded (from our own surveys). The results should provide insights into the types of skills and training that are required in manufacturing today, and the impact on wages, all arising from technological changes. The analysis of new industry-specific technologies and innovative HRM practices will contribute to the literature in several important ways. First, while many studies suggest that new computer-based technologies have contributed to the demand for more skilled workers, the measures of technology used in existing studies are not persuasive because they are not specific to individual industries and plants. Here, we propose to measure actual technological advances in three industries and examine how the skill requirements of plants that adopt these technologies differ from the skill requirements of plants without these technologies. Second, despite claims that new HRM practices that promote more employee participation require a different kind of worker, no existing study examines the impact of work practice innovations that have emerged in American industry in the last twenty years on workers’ skill requirements. Using the resulting matched data set, we will find out whether network use within plants, as measured by the ASM supplement, is correlated with other technological improvements on the production line. These matched surveys would enhance the Census Bureau’s knowledge of these manufacturing industries and evaluate the quality of the new data collected by the Computer Network supplement. Additionally, the methodology developed by this project for linking supplemental datasets in a panel format will provide an illustration of how these data series can be linked and then used to conduct similar research in other manufacturing areas, thereby extending the usefulness of the LRD. This project will determine whether there are industry differences in the way plants interpret and answer the network use questions included on the ASM Computer Network Use supplement, and thus suggest whether future adjustments to these questions are necessary. This research will allow us to assess whether our technology questions might be considered valuable in a future ASM surveys— surveys such as the industry-specific supplements or the Computer Network Use supplement.
