abstract: "Our planned research centers on the question on how producers with different organizational structures react to long-term shifts in industry demand. Several recent papers have analyzed the failure rates of firms in industries, and have related the clustering of firm exits to stages in an industry’s evolution ((Gort and Klepper (1982), Jovanovic (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990), Klepper (1996). Not much is known about how a producer’s organizational form affects its reaction to industry shocks and how it predicts the redeployment of productive assets in the next stage of the industry’s evolution. In particular, it may be that the advantage of belonging to a larger organization and having access to internal capital markets is particularly significant at times when industry-level cost or demand shifts. We therefore focus on examining the relation between the organizational forms of firms and the long-run characteristics of the industries in which they operate, and on how these factors affect acquisition and survival probabilities of firms. The project will examine relationships among the firm identifiers, industry classification, and accounting information in the Census Bureau’s Census of Manufacturers (CM), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), and COMPUSTAT. Using recently developed links between COMPUSTAT and the CES data, we will be able to assess the relative importance of public and private firms in the Census Bureau’s various surveys. Public firms can raise capital by issuing securities publicly to a broad class of investors and may be a larger source of growth for the economy and thus more should be known about these firms. Specific substitutive insights about the quality of the Census Bureau’s economic surveys we can provide in this area include the amount of sales at the firm level are distributed between manufacturing and non-manufacturing, and how much investment takes place at the divisional level outside of manufacturing. We will be enhancing the Census of Manufactures data with the financial data from COMPUSTAT. We will provide information from our study that will help the Census Bureau improve the sampling frame for the ASM by comparing the sample of establishments that is in the CM and ASM and the set of publicly traded firms from COMPUSTAT and by assessing the relative sampling weights of private vs. public firms on COMPUSTAT. We estimate how firm financial resources (data from COMPUSTAT) affect firm’s real business decisions (data obtained from the CM and ASM), such as investment, acquisitions, and mergers. Using the links provided between COMPUSTAT & the LRD data we can thus study the interactions between financial structure and financing patterns and firms real decisions (technology adoption, investment, mergers) and thus increase information that the Census Bureau can provide without the budget cost of a new or expanded survey or census, and without increasing respondent burden. We can aid the Census Bureau by examining whether ASM establishments are being sampled at the appropriate weights given criteria of sampling both representative public and private firms. We can see what fraction of COMPUSTAT small firms are currently being sampled in the ASM and compare it to the fraction of non-COMPUSTAT firms that are being sampled."
