abstract: "Although the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) attempt to interview virtually every living sample member during each round, some sample members have not been interviewed for many years. In this project, we will test for nonresponse bias in the NLSY79 (birth years 1957-1964) and NLSY97 (birth years 1980-1984) by matching the NLS records to the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Census (DC) surveys and the American Community Survey (ACS). Matching to these datasets will allow us to compare NLS respondents to non-respondents in terms of key variables representing a range of economic and social characteristics. The DC short-form data, though they cover a limited set of topics, can be matched to nearly all NLS sample members. The long-form DC and ACS are more comprehensive in terms of topics but have smaller samples. We will use the matched data to estimate statistical models that address three issues related to nonresponse in NLS surveys. First, we will estimate how outcomes measured at a point in time in the DC short-form data (marital status, number of children, household structure and size, and geography) are related to the likelihood of nonresponse in the NLS. Second, we will use the DC long-form and ACS data to estimate how nonresponse affects regression estimates of economic relationships, such as the returns to education. Third, we will use the DC long-form and ACS data to estimate quantile regressions that measure how the earnings and income distributions in the NLSY data sets are affected by unit nonresponse."
