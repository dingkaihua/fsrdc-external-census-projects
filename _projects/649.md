abstract: "The measurement of foreign trade ﬂows—imports and exports—is an important component of the information the Census Bureau collects on the overall U.S. economy. The research will bring data from these two programs together to provide more extensive characterization of foreign trade activity in U.S. manufacturing ﬁrms and variation in ﬁrm productivity. The project will prepare estimates of the relationship between productivity and how ﬁrms organize production with a particular focus on the role of trade and foreign sourcing in the supply chain. This project will also produce estimates of the relationship between exports, imports, and growth in productivity and ﬁrm size. The project will contain analyses that serve to assess the quality of data collected on the supply chain in the 2002 Economic Census. The project will address whether productivity level determines the organizational form of the ﬁrm and whether importing leads to productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing or if higher productivity leads to imports. By estimating models of productivity growth that take the impact of both import and export behavior into account, this research will provide new, enhanced estimates of the relationship between exports, imports, and productivity and how such relationships might vary with ﬁrm characteristics and industry. Estimates will also be produced of the relationship between ﬁrm growth (employment and revenues), imports, and exports. Accurate estimation of such relationships is an important tool to be used in the consideration of how trade liberalization will impact businesses and the economy. The results will also provide empirical evidence regarding the hypothesis that imports play a relatively insigniﬁcant role in productivity growth."
