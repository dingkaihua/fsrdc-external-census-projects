abstract: "In the competitive world economy, firms will only be able to support high-quality employment if they continually find ways to adopt new and more sophisticated technologies. One determinant of adoption is the extent to which employees are willing to share information about new technologies, and how employment contracts shape their incentives to do so. Since Freeman and Medoff’’s landmark book, “What Do Unions Do?” (1984), the fact that unions may help to improve communication within firms and contribute to productivity improvements has been widely appreciated. But despite a fair amount of research documenting correlations between unionization and productivity or innovation, there have not been any studies that use experimental or quasi-experimental research design to estimate the causal relationship unionization and technology adoption. The current project seeks to fill that gap. We propose to use the discontinuity generated by the majority-vote rule in National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) elections to investigate the causal effect of unionization on technology adoption. The main research question is: how does unionization of a firm (or establishment) affect its propensity to adopt new, advanced technologies or management practices? The project will estimate the effect of unionization by comparing workplaces where unions narrowly won representation elections to workplaces where unions narrowly lost. The argument underlying this strategy, known as a “regression discontinuity design,” is that the workplaces where unions narrowly won or lost will be on average similar on other dimensions, including unobserved dimensions, and hence that comparing them can isolate the causal effect of union representation. The project will draw on information on all unionization elections supervised by the NLRB from 1961 to 2015. This information will be merged primarily with two Census Bureau datasets, the Survey of Manufacturing Technology (SMT) for 1988, 1991, and 1993, and the Managerial and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) for 2010 and 2015 and will draw on  supplemental information from other Census datasets."
