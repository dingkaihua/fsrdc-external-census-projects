abstract: "This paper aims to study the U.S. importing firm behaviors during the U.S.-China tariff increase period. With matched firm-level and product-level data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, we conduct regressions to reveal tariff impacts over various time horizons on firm dynamics, as well as the firms' pricing behavior. The major datasets we use are LFTTD, LBD, ASE, BRDIS, Economic Census, and annual establishment and firm surveys from the Census, and other publicly available or private non-census data, such as CompStat, USITC tariff data, BEA input-output table, BLS product-level price index. On the extensive margin of the firm behaviors, we expect to understand the entry and exit decisions of firms' sourcing destinations and products with OLS and discrete choice models. On the intensive margin, we study the impact of tariff on firms' employment, wage, sales, and R&D expenditures. We also explore the product-level tariff elasticities of price with different time windows around the tariff change events."
