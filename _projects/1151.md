abstract: "This study will identify the differing economic impacts, measured in a variety of ways, between two forms of bankruptcy: the reorganization process of chapter 11 and the liquidation process of chapter 7. Using Census microdata combined with external data, the establishment-level operations of these firms can be observed following the bankruptcy resolution, and the different impacts will be quantified. Typically, research treats the cost of bankruptcy in terms of reduction in the market value of the bankrupt firm. However, when a firm is completely liquidated, it does not end with zero total economic value since its assets (and human capital) are sold to other productive firms and thereby redeployed. This research will quantify the costs of bankruptcy in terms of employment, payroll, and productivity losses, rather than just the dollar value lost to the bankrupt firm and its creditors. This will more accurately depict from where the losses caused by financial distress come, and how large they truly are. Furthermore, relatively little consideration has been given to the question of whether financial distress imposes externalities on other companies. Suppliers, customers, and competitors may be affected when a firm is liquidated or reorganized. This project will examine the behavior of other firms operating in the local economies of bankrupt firms in different bankruptcy regime, in order to quantify the bankruptcy regime differential impact. Although it is very difficult to overcome the selection into the two bankruptcy regimes, the researchers will use heterogeneity across bankruptcy judges as an instrumental variable to estimate the unbiased effect that compares the effects these bankruptcy regimes have on financially distressed firms."
