abstract: "The project will merge the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM/LRD), and Census of Manufacturers (CMF/LRD) databases with the SDC Platinum database provided by the Securities Data Corporation (SDC) to assess the quality of merger and acquisition information in Title 13, Chapter 5 Census data, and to investigate investment and productivity changes surrounding managerial successions. Senior management turnover events are typically followed by operational changes as well as asset restructurings, such as plant sales and acquisitions. Matched information from SDC will allow us to identify plants that change hands around the time of turnover in the management team, and to track factor productivity for both the sold and the remaining assets. We will study managers' incentives to divest underperforming assets, and whether better corporate governance leads to more timely and efficient management replacement decisions. We will also explore long-run trends in corporate governance, investment, and firms' organizational structures.
We will estimate the overall change in plant performance, as measured by total factor productivity (TFP), following managerial turnover. We will also use the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) to examine if the financial position of the firm improves following management change, and what the interplay between changes in TFP and changes in firm financial performance might be. Detail drivers behind any pre- and post-turnover performance changes will be explored, such as plant factor efficiency, employment changes using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD-ECF/QWI) data, plant utilization from the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (PCU), asset sales, including the sale of plants or segments of the firm, capital investment from the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES), research and development investment from the Research and Development (R&D) survey, or the acquisition of other plants as captured in the LBD and Ownership Change Database (OCD). Census and SDC files will be linked using the Compustat-SSEL bridge file, the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL-NA), and the LEHD bridge files (BRB/GAL). Firms' asset management decisions affect various measures collected in Census Bureau data programs, including measures of investment and the purchase and sale of establishments and other firms. This project will inform Census program staff of underlying mechanisms that drive the values of reported measures, and the extent to which Census data programs capture firms' organizational changes. Variation in the quality of Census data on merger and acquisition activity is expected t+H264o be related to firm characteristics, such as acquisition ownership share, firm size, legal form of organization, and family ownership. We will explore if misreporting of acquisition activity is related to information uncertainty due to the duration of time elapsed between when an acquisition is announced and when it is completed, and discrepancies between the expected date and actual date as reported in the SDC data."
