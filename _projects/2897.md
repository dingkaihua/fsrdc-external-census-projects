abstract: "Food insecurity is a significant public health problem in the United States and the are concerns of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household food security. While there are many programs and service available to address food insecurity, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the emergency food system, use of these resources differs between demographic groups. Urban/rural status is a key sociodemographic factor that influences food security and use of food assistance services, but publicly available measures of urban/rural status are imprecise. This study aims to understand relationships between food security, SNAP participation, and receipt of emergency food, and the rural-urban continuum before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we will link USDA Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes to 2015-2021 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement data. RUCA codes provide census-level tract measures of the urban/rural continuum that will allow for a granular examination of the role of urban/rural status plays in our outcomes of interest (food security, SNAP participation, and receipt of emergency food). We will produce weighted prevalences for each outcome and use multivariable logistic regression to examine the impact of time period (before versus during COVID-19 pandemic) and urban/rural status on each. This research is critical to understand rural and urban differences in food security and use of food assistance resources as social determinants of health during the COVID-19 pandemic and influence future policy and programmatic decisions."
