abstract: "This project will use internal Census business data to study how uncertainty affects firm investment, the methods that firms use to insulate themselves from uncertainty, and the factors that drive responses to uncertainty. 

Empirically, proving a causal relationship between uncertainty and firm activities is challenging because economic uncertainty is tied to the business cycle, which directly determines firm investment. Hence, a major empirical challenge is to disentangle the effects of uncertainty from those of the business cycle. Additionally, aggregate firm-level data are not granular enough to properly identify the actions of large firms whose operations span multiple countries and US states. The empirical design of this project resolves these inherent identification problems by using establishment-level data in a setting where gubernatorial elections serve as an instrument for uncertainty.  

The findings will provide new evidence about the effects of uncertainty on investment both in the short and long run.  We estimate effects on several proxies for investment: establishment births and deaths based on the Longitudinal Business Database, capital expenditures and plant utilization from the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization, research and development as measured in the Business Research & Development and Innovation Survey and Survey of Industrial Research and Development, and patents from USPTO data linked at the establishment level. The results will shed light on the types of investment distortions induced by uncertainty (e.g., intangible and tangible investment substitution).  Moreover, the results will assess whether these are short-term distortions or whether they persist in the long run."
