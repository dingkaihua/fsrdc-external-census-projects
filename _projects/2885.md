abstract: "Exploratory products released by the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrate that SNAP eligibility and participation rates vary across space and time (2021). Yet, there have been few efforts to correlate this eligibility/participation gap with individual/community-level characteristics. Our team's ongoing qualitative efforts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education program (SNAP-Ed) in Illinois has identified over 140 linked networks where participants commute between 102 counties for work, groceries, and social resources. To build on these qualitative findings, we will link journey-to-work data from the American Community Survey (ACS) with SNAP administrative records to quantify rural spatial uncertainties of food access for socially disadvantaged and military families. We use a unique linked dataset consisting of SNAP administrative records from eleven states linked to demographic information from the ACS. This dataset will be merged with community-level characteristics as potential predictors of the gap between participation and eligibility."
