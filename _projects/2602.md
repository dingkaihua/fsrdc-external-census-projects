abstract: "In the last two decades, US states have implemented an unprecedented number of punitive immigration policies that aim to curb the flow of undocumented immigration from Latin America through measures that increase immigration enforcement and decrease undocumented migrants' access to employment, health and other services, and benefits. Still not well understood is how immigration policies and implementation (IPI) impact violence among and against Latinos and Hispanics and what the implications of this violence are for children's development and wellbeing. We propose a comprehensive framework of how IPI potentially affects violence in the family, school and community. The proposed study combines restricted-access geocoded data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) with a new time-varying geocoded dataset on immigration laws and their implementation. This would allow the proposed study to address previously unanswered questions regarding whether and how Hispanic population's risk of violence changes in response to the immigration policy environment using a within-person fixed effects approach that exploits spatiotemporal variation in the timing of IPI across different states and counties in the United States."
