abstract: "We will address the following research questions on the relationship between the long-term earnings patterns of the working poor who are eligible for the food stamp program (FSP) and their participation in the program: 
• How do the historical earnings patterns of the 1996 cohort of participants and eligible nonparticipants among the working poor differ, and what are the explanations for any differences? 
• To what extent are historical and future earnings patterns predictive of participation in the FSP for the 1996 cohort, given individual characteristics and state welfare policies? 
• To what extent do historical earnings of the 1996 cohort predict future earnings, and how is that related to FSP participation? 
• How do the earnings patterns of the 1996 cohort compare to an earlier cohort from 1992? 
A major concern among policy makers is that a significant number of eligible households, especially the working poor, do not participate in the program. One study found that only 46 percent of working FSP eligible households participated in the program in 1994, compared to an aggregate rate of 69 percent for all FSP eligible households. Some argue that these low participation rates might be an indication that the FSP is not fulfilling its primary purpose of providing food assistance to all who need it. Another explanation is that these households are eligible for a short period of time and anticipate an increase in their earnings. 
We would like to use restricted research files of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to the Social Security Administration’s Summary Earnings Records (SER) to identify long-term earnings patterns of the working poor. To date, there is very limited information on the historical earnings patterns of these groups, primarily because of data limitations. The matched SIPP/SER data address this limitation by providing complete earnings histories for nationally representative samples, including large samples of the working poor. Hence, our analysis will provide the first comprehensive analysis of long-term earnings patterns of the working poor. In addition, this study will provide the USDA with important information regarding the reliability of the participation estimates it obtains from the SIPP. The accuracy of the number of eligible persons is based, in part, on the accuracy of the earnings estimates. This is an important concern, as the share of food stamp recipients who are working has been growing in recent years. It might be, for instance, that many working poor households that appear eligible for the FSP based on SIPP data, but say they do not participate, are really ineligible because their earnings are higher than what they report. Our study will examine the accuracy of the earnings data in the SIPP core files, as well as the validity and usefulness of the employment information in the SIPP’s employment history topical module. 
We are interested in the entire history of earnings because for policy reasons it is important to understand how longer-term earnings patterns for adults in working poor families are related to participation in the FSP. The SIPP can support limited analysis of this issue through use of self-reported income over the panel period and some very limited information that is captured in an employment history module. We would like to use the matched data to assess whether better information about past or expected future earnings would improve our understanding of food stamp participation. In summary, this study will provide a better understanding of (1) who under-reports or overreports earnings and employment on the SIPP; (2) how the underreporting or overreporting affects findings on the working poor population and the take-up rates of the FSP; and (3) whether individuals reporting employment on the employment history topical module are able to recall past jobs."
