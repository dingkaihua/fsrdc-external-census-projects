abstract: "This study uses microdata from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey and other Census Bureau surveys to investigate the impact of research and development (R&D) activity, and specifically process and product innovations, on firm performance, including sales, shipments, and/or receipts. The research will also examine the relationship between innovation and firm performance by quantifying similarities and differences in the relationship across firms and especially industries. In particular, the researcher will identify industries where process and, separately, product innovations are important determinants of variability in firm performance. The research will also identify industries where the conditional processes under which process innovation and/or product innovation occur are important determinants of variability in firm performance.
