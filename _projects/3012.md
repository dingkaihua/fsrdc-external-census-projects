abstract: "While a wealth of research has addressed the question of how mergers and acquisitions (M&A) impact ag-
gregate productivity and welfare in an economy, studies thus far have failed to ascertain microeconomic
information critical to the modeling of merger impacts on a macroeconomic scale. Existing studies have
either restricted analysis of mergers' effects to a single bespoke industry or have suffered econometric prob-
lems. Therefore, past research has not identified generalizable impacts of mergers on firm-level markup and
productivity in manufacturing (or any other sector). We provide contribution by identifying productivity in
merger-rich sectors' firms by combining a parametric production function estimator, a robust law of motion
for productivity that incorporates acquisition history, and econometric adjustments to the proxy function
approach that renders the method appropriate for quinquennial census data. We then identify impact of
mergers on markups through firm- and market-level output demand elasticities, and then leverage matched
difference-in-differences to identify shocks to productivity induced by said mergers. By combining a diverse
set of census datasets with Thomson/Refinitiv's SDC Platinum M&A dataset, we are able to draw novel and
wide-ranging conclusions about impact of mergers in six diverse industries in the United States Economy's
manufacturing sector and in other sectors."
