abstract: "Existing research suggests that hearing impairment is associated with increased mortality, but these studies are limited by relatively small datasets with an overabundance of elderly respondents, who are at higher risk of both hearing disability and death. The present study aims to clarify the mortality risks of hearing disability among all age groups using the 2008-2015 Mortality Disparities in American Communities (MDAC) data. By combining these data with external measures of community social support, the project will produce nationally-representative estimates of the social and demographic conditions of hearing impaired persons and determine whether individual, household, and community characteristics mediate the relationship between hearing impairment and mortality."
