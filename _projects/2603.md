abstract: "An important yet outstanding question is whether health insurance reduces mortality. Much of the previous literature has attempted to answer this question using population-level or aggregate data. If the mortality effects of health insurance are small, however, they will be difficult to detect without detailed data linking mortality records to individual characteristics that identify the individuals most likely to benefit from health insurance. We aim to study the effects of Medicare on mortality by examining whether mortality changes at the Medicare age-65 eligibility cutoff using a regression discontinuity framework. We link the ACS and Decennial Census data to the Numident file using PIK crosswalks. Importantly, the Numident records contain exact dates of birth and death for individuals with a Social Security Number, which allows us to precisely identify Medicare eligibility (our treatment) and death (our outcome variable). The large sample size and granular dates in the Numident file makes it more likely that we would be able to detect small changes in mortality. By linking administrative death records to information on individual survey data, we can potentially identify whether changes in mortality differ across socioeconomic characteristics such as income level and health insurance status. Additionally, we will examine whether the effects of Medicare on mortality change over time, such as before and after the introduction of the ACA."
