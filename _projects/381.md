abstract: "This project explores the effect of banking market structure on the market structure and growth of nonfinancial industries. It asks whether concentration in the banking market promotes the formation of industries constituted by a few, large firms, or, rather, whether it facilitates the continuous entry of new firms, thus maintaining unconcentrated market structures across industries. Theoretical arguments could be made to support either hypothetical scenario. Further, it looks at the impact of banking market structure on employment growth, new firm entry, and establishment exit rates. Empirical evidence will be derived merging the panel information contained in the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) with that on the banking industry contained in the publicly available Commercial Bank Report on Condition and Income of the Federal Reserve System. This project will evaluate the quality of the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate census, and LBD data in two ways: 1) by assessing missing items, imputations, and inequalities; and 2) by comparing it to the Commercial Bank and Holding Company Database compiled by the Federal Reserve."
