abstract: "This project will examine the effects of electronic commerce (e-commerce) on particular retail and services industries. The researchers will investigate the diverse impact of e-commerce on the different types of traditional establishments that operate within an industry. In particular, the project will look at how the rise of the online channel has influenced entry and exit decisions for individual establishments. The project will also trace the impact of e-commerce on aggregate productivity growth at the industry-geographic market level, and link aggregate growth to establishment-level productivity changes."
