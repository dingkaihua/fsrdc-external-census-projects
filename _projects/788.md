abstract: "This project studies the causal link between schooling and wage inequality in recent decades. Because schooling is endogenous, we plan to use quarter of birth and college costs as instrumental variables. The instruments are to be constructed from restricted data on birth month in the 2000 Census and birth year in the 1990 Census, and high school county-level location information in the NLS Original Cohort Geocode and public-available historical data about college opening. We also plan to use birthday information to develop an improved years-of-schooling imputation for the 1990 and 2000 PUMS."
