abstract: "Public schools are more racially segregated than the school attendance areas to which they supply services. Individual choice for private schools may play a substantial role in contributing to public school segregation, beyond what it would be if all students enrolled in the public school that served their residential area. One of three basic factors likely drives private school enrollment rates. First, children from one racial group, particularly white children, may be more likely to enroll in a private school as shares of non-white students in their school catchment areas increases. Second, members of all racial groups are less likely to enroll in private schools as shares of children in their catchment area who are of their same race increases. A third view is that race is inconsequential in driving private school enrollment. These competing models will be assessed by integrating three data sources: restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year period estimates for 2005-2009, the School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS), which contains geography delineating school catchment areas for thousands of such areas for the 2009-2010 school year, and the Common Core of Data, which describes the characteristics of children who are enrolled in all public schools throughout the United States. Analyses of these three datasets will result in models estimating the probability that a child is enrolled in private school based on their race and the racial composition of the school catchment area in which they live, while holding constant a battery of family, attendance area, and school characteristics."
