abstract: "In this study, we prepare estimates of population measuring the effects of local labor demand shocks on the labor market outcomes and geographic migration of U.S. workers. To do so, we generate a valuable new set of geographic delineations that are consistently defined across the 1990–2000 decade in five states. Within these delineations, we create estimates of how labor market and demographic characteristics of the resident populations changed over the decade. To generate our estimates of labor market behavior, we exploit a natural experiment in the aircraft manufacturing industry during the 1990s: a variety of plausibly exogenous factors that combined to severely diminish aircraft manufacturing in several localities, creating local labor demand shocks. Due to the end of the Cold War, a recession, and a glut in the commercial aircraft market, employment in this industry fell by 25 percent between 1989 and 1999, with the decline concentrated early in the decade. In a related development, the industry also restructured during this decade; consolidations borne out of a need to maintain minimum economies of scale caused some localities to be especially hard-hit by the decline. At the same time, increased competition in the industry led to the increased adoption of lean production technologies that diminished employment in traditional aircraft manufacturing further. Because the aircraft manufacturing industry is so large, it comprises a significant proportion of employment in several areas where it experienced these severe declines. We generate our estimates of the labor market behavior populations by examining the changes of various population characteristics in these localities. We use our estimates of population characteristics within our newly defined geographic units to perform this analysis. 
We will use data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses of Population, including geographic detail, to construct indexes measuring how wages, employment rates, and population changed over the 1990s within narrowly defined geographic areas, while controlling for demographic compositions of the areas. We match these indexes up with measures of changes in overall job availability in the areas based on publicly available data from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS). We use this linked database to estimate reduced form equations measuring the elasticities of wage, employment rate, and population of various demographic groups and sectors to the labor demand shock caused by aircraft manufacturing’s decline. This research will create a valuable intermediate product: a database of Census Bureau data that is linked across time through consistently defined geographic designations and linked with establishment-based measures of employment. This database will provide a useful tool for the improvement of data quality via improved sensitivity checks for data review, additional inputs to imputation for nonresponse, and establishment-based checks on employment information by place-of work that could be used in a benchmarking procedure. In addition, our research into creating geographic links and examining their use in the study of local labor markets will provide a valuable tool for evaluating the labor market designations created by the Census Bureau. The database will also provide an alternative starting point for future research involving geographic detail."
