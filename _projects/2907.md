abstract: "Our overarching substantive goal is to identify the pathways that lead to increased representation of veterans in STEM fields, particularly among women and racial minorities. Prior research has already established a strong statistical association between military service and STEM-related educational and occupational outcomes. Although there has been a growing amount of research on the gendered dynamics of the veteran-to-STEM pipeline, there is much limited work on the racial, class, and institutional-dynamics that may contribute to this relationship. Moreover, the mechanisms producing this seemingly counterintuitive pattern remain unclear due to the limitations of publicly-available data. As a step toward our long-term goal, our primary substantive goal for this proposal is to identify the links between military service and educational/occupational outcomes that effectively broaden participation in STEM. By combining multiple surveys and administrative data only made possible via the secure RDC environment, our findings will allow us to track longitudinal trajectories related to military service, education, and career - transcending the limitations of extant cross-sectional analyses that only allow an examination of the correlation between military service and STEM outcomes. Using the 2000 Decennial Census (long-form), the 2005-current American Community Survey, the 2013-current National Survey of College Graduates, externally provided IPEDS institutional data, and the 2020 Department of Veteran's Affairs U.S. Veteran's File, we seek to examine to what extent military service/veteran status impact STEM trajectories (educational and occupational), including how this association is moderated by gender, race, class, and institutional characteristics - individually and collectively. We also plan to examine whether our findings vary when using different definitions of "STEM" from other federal agencies and may be most pronounced among those in Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E) fields. We plan to use logistic, multinomial logistic, and KHB decomposition analyses to examine our focal aims."
