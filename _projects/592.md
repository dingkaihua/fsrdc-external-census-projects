abstract: "The evaluation of the effect on estimates after imputation techniques have been applied and accounting for its uncertainty is an important enterprise in any survey. This research project seeks to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the effect of the current implemented imputation techniques in the annual Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD).  Since the early 1990s, there has not been a systematic evaluation of the current imputation procedures and their effects on survey estimates. The purpose of this project is to evaluate and recommend improvements to the current imputation methods in the SIRD. Specifically, we will use the 1999-2003 SIRD datasets at the Center for Economic Studies to evaluate the effects of current imputation methods on survey estimates in the SIRD. This project has three aims: (1) to describe the current imputation methods currently used in the SIRD; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the current imputation methods through precision and accuracy measures; and (3) to compare current imputation methods with alter-native imputation methods and formulate recommendations for improvement. The overall goal is to assess the effect of the imputation techniques on the quality of this survey data, including variance estimates. Simulations will be carried out using standard precision and accuracy measures (bias, variance, and mean square error) for evaluating the current imputation methods. Multivariate distributional patterns of missing-ness will be described during implementation of simulations. Sensitivity analysis will be con-ducted to describe worst and best case scenarios on departures from current observed percentages of missingness."
