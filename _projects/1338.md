abstract: "This project will estimate the effects of affirmative action regulation and equal employment opportunity law – what are referred to as anti-discrimination laws – have on establishment productivity. To measure these effects, the researcher will measure total factor productivity and labor productivity using Economic Census data, and exploit variation across establishments and over time in exposure to anti-discrimination law to identify its causal effect. In addition, the researcher will estimate how these effects vary with the demographic background of the establishment's ownership. Data from the EEO-1 form include self-reported employment totals at the establishment level from 1971 to 2011 and are unique in that they include employment breakdowns by race, ethnicity, sex, and occupation. The researcher will benchmark these data with establishment employment totals by race and sex in the 1987 and 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners data."
