abstract: "This project will investigate the extent of labor hoarding versus productivity change by establishments and firms during the Great Recession, and differences in responses compared to prior recessions and across sectors. The first part analyses the response of firms and establishments to the changes in total industry demand during the Great Recession and subsequent recovery. We will also contrast job loss and closure between firms that invest heavily in intangible capital, such as R&D, and those that invest less. Our analysis of the Census data prior to the GR showed a huge widening of the distribution of average wages of firms and of establishments in the same firm. We will assess whether there is greater heterogeneity in employment responses among firms and establishments within firms than in the past, and the characteristics of the observed heterogeneity. A novel feature is that we will add measures of occupational status and human capital to the establishments. Using measures of sales, capital input, employment, material inputs and wages we plan to look more carefully into the productivity dispersion, employment and wage dispersion across establishments in general. First we want to establish and analyze the rent sharing behavior of firms. We will develop this literature further, providing estimates of rent sharing for different types of employees, both in terms of occupation, gender and in terms of educational level.

The existence of a wide distribution of wages across establishments, even for the same worker, raises questions of the performance of the labor market, and why market forces do not work to eliminate these wage differentials. The behavior of employers thus seems to indicate that there are large frictions in labor markets. One way of studying such frictions is to study job-to-job transitions. We plan to study the relationship between the wage distribution across establishments and job-to-job transitions over time and between different types of workers. Furthermore, worker flows across firms and establishments create direct connections between various organizational units. These connections provide possible avenues for information flows and spillovers between firms. We will study the interconnectedness between firms and establishments as means of both knowledge transfer and as instruments for measuring the competitiveness of the economy. "
