abstract: "The proposed research will accomplish two goals.  The first goal is the completion of the construction of a unique, very large, representative data set on workers, employers, and employer characteristics, where the employer characteristics are obtained in part from information on the multiple workers working for each employer.  For each individual worker in the data, this data set will also include detailed information on both residential location and geographic location of the place of work.  This matched employee-employer data set will represent a significant improvement upon existing matched data sets for the U.S., and result in gains to the Census Bureau in terms of new data products and improvements in current data programs.  The second goal is to complete a number of projects exploiting these data to bring new evidence to bear on the alternative supply-side explanations of racial, ethnic, and language differences in labor market outcomes, and in so doing not only test these explanations but also provide an assessment of their importance relative to demand-side theories."
