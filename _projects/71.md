abstract: "Previous work has shown that workers' productivity is systematically correlated with average education in the metropolitan area where they live.  This project is to investigate a possible explanation for this correlation by looking at how firm behavior is affected by human capital in their local labor market.  In particular, I plan to match the LRD with the SMT & the public version of the Census of Population & Housing to test whether productivity & investment in new technologies of firms in a given metro area are correlated with average education there, after controlling for firms' own human capital"
