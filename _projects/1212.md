abstract: "This project investigates the impact of a reliance on credit markets on real corporate behavior—patterns of investment and employment—by conducting a detailed microeconomic analysis using plant-level data. Two topics will be considered: first, real estate asset collateral values and corporate debt capacity; second, the transfer of control rights to creditors (“creditor intervention”) following contractual default in private credit agreements. The project will build new bridge files between Census Bureau data and external sources, such as data on financial contracts associated with bank lending in the U.S. syndicated loan market (Thomson Reuters’ Loan Pricing Corporation Deal Scan dataset), as well as data on real estate price indices and local housing supply elasticities. By producing estimates of various firm characteristics, this project will enhance the Census Bureau’s understanding of economy-wide establishment dynamics (formation, closure, growth, contraction, and performance) and their responsiveness to changes in credit market conditions.
