abstract: "Using Census data, tariffs, and exchange rates, I estimate the structural parameters governing firm pricing decisions: the markup super-elasticity and the marginal cost scale elasticity. The first parameter determines how much firms adjust markups in the face of marginal cost shocks. The second parameter is a function of returns-to-scale in production. The estimation strategy draws from a new structural model of passthrough and involves data on prices, output, marginal costs, and external shocks such as tariffs and exchange rates. Armed with the parameter estimates, I leverage the structure of my model to measure the contribution of markups versus marginal costs to cost shock passthrough, and particularly the scale channel of passthrough for both tariffs and exchange rates."
