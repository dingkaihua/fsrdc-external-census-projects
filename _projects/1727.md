abstract: "Marriage, fertility, and migration behavior have been the subject of extensive research across many academic disciplines. Considerable work has been devoted to investigating why, whether, and when people decide to marry, have children, and change residences, whether particular programs or factors influence these decisions, and how these choices in turn affect other life decisions. This project considers determinants of these outcomes and evaluates the data used in such analyses. To these ends, this project considers the extent to which empirical analyses using the American Community Survey (ACS) marital history and marital status questions yield comparable or divergent results. The researcher considers determinants of marriage decisions, on their own and in conjunction with fertility and migration decisions, and examine the role of various legal changes and natural experiments occurring between 2008 and 2015. The project will also assess the benefit of the ACS marital history questions, which have been considered for removal in recent years and may again be considered for removal or revision in the future.
