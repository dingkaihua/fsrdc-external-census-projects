abstract: "The Urban Institute has estimated that nonprofit workers account for more than 8 percent of all income in the United States. This labor share has grown over time, as have estimates of the income and expenses of nonprofits as a share of national income. This project merges Census Bureau data on nearly all firms and establishments in participating states with IRS data on those firms that are nonprofits to describe the scope and growth of the nonprofit sector in the United States. This research examines the reasons for the growth of the nonprofit sector, the ways in which taxes and other policies affect the nonprofit sector, the nature of competition between for-profits and nonprofits, and the effects of nonprofits on their communities.
