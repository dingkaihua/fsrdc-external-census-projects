abstract: "As skilled women have responded to the rise in labor market opportunities and entered the professions, declining proportions of these women are in teaching. Employing data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series and the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Men, Young Women, and Youth-79, I seek to estimate the effect of local labor market changes in teacher and in professional earnings opportunities on employment in teaching and in the quality of those who teach, as measured by performance on standardized tests."
