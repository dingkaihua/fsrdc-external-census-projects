abstract: "The National Employer Survey (NES) was administered by the Census Bureau on behalf of the Educational Quality of the Workforce Program to conduct a survey on employers’ hiring and human resource practices. The proposed project extends the use of the NES beyond the issues of training and education and informs broader labor market issues by focusing on variable data that has been collected but has not been extensively used. In doing so, this project will yield clear benefits to the Census Bureau’s data program. The 1997 National Employer Survey – Phase II is one of very few employer surveys that contains data on involuntary job loss and collective bargaining coverage at the establishment level. An important human resource issue is how employers manage changes in employment levels. Employers in the United States have been facing increasing pressure to eliminate jobs; thus, employees are experiencing a decline in job security. Unions, as the only institutionalized means of worker representation, can be expected to have an impact on whether or not management considers workers’ interests when making decisions regarding changes in employment levels. This project merges the NES establishment-level data with industry-level and local labor market characteristics to identify factors affecting involuntary job loss, with a particular focus on unionization. Access to non-public data provide the Census Bureau data program with the following benefits: (1) an enhanced database created by merging NES-II data with contextual data such as the Herfindahl Index, industry unionization rates, local unemployment rates, industrial production indexes, and industry imports, allowing comparisons with the AMA and MCTES data; (2) an increased understanding of the quality of the data for use in econometric analyses and an evaluation of the quality of the data by comparing coefficient estimates to estimates obtained from the AMA and MCTES data; and (3) documentation for new data collection needs to understand employer behavior."
