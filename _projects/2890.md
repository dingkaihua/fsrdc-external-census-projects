abstract: "The project uses a combination of Census Bureau and external, proprietary microdata on venture
capital funding to study labor mobility across the market cycle for technology and growth firms.
Specifically, it will produce novel estimates on the consequences of early-stage financing for
employment dynamics among high-growth, entrepreneurial businesses, an important subset of the
economy that the Census Bureau's current data infrastructure provides relatively little information
about. To produce these estimates, we leverage LBD and LEHD data that allow us to observe
patterns of mobility and displacement over a long period of time and over multiple boom and bust
episodes. When combined with the most comprehensive data available on venture capital funding,
we will be able to recover new estimates on the consequences of technology cycles for the
allocation of human capital in addition to producing causal estimates of the effect of a market
correction or "bust" on labor market outcomes."
