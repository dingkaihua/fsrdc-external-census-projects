abstract: "This project has four main components.  In one component, newly available linkages between census records in different years will be used to study two dimensions of neighborhood change: changes in relative income levels (such as gentrification and community impoverishment) and in racial/ethnic composition (such as increasing or declining diversity). The general approach using data from 2000 and 2010 is to identify the location of very person enumerated in either decennial census in each year, then analyze the composition of movers and stayers. The same database will also be used to study selective mobility into and out of neighborhoods at the individual level. The second component is to improve the estimation of tract characteristics in a given year within the boundaries of tracts as they were defined in a later year. Confidential census data sets identify people's census tract location based on the tract boundaries at the time of enumeration, but they also provide information that can be used to place them in other boundaries. This project will develop estimates for tract characteristics in 1950-2000 within 2010 tract boundaries, then extend the estimates to 2020 tract boundaries. The third component seeks to improve estimates of segregation of people across census tracts in terms of social characteristics such as education and occupational standing, similar to recent studies of income segregation.  These measures are susceptible to systematic bias associated with sample size and weighting, and the analysis will introduce methods of bias correction in order to evaluate change over time accurately.  The fourth component is small area estimation (SAE) for characteristics of individual census tracts.  We will examine Bayesian SAE models to increase reliability of point estimates of various population characteristics at the census tract scale that are based on sample data. The result will be an improved understanding of issues of sampling variability at the tract scale, methods for improving estimates, and disclosure of alternative estimates for a select set of variables."
