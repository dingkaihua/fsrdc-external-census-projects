abstract: "Childhood lead exposure causes irreversible neurodevelopmental and behavioral changes, affecting human capital formation. But no research has yet tested for long-run impacts of childhood lead exposure. The purpose of this project is to estimate the long-run effects of lead exposure on adult labor market and related outcomes. To implement our analysis, we will explore the impacts of exposure on lead from drinking water and leaded gasoline on labor market outcomes, including employment and earnings. We will also explore these effects on related outcomes, like education attainment.  Restricted RDC data are required so that we can connect the county of birth from Numident File to demographic data in household survey data using the Personal Identification Key (PIK).  Knowing the county of birth of the respondents in the household data and paring that with the lead in drinking water violation data and lead in gasoline data researchers provided will allow us to determine the lead exposure of respondents in their early childhood. This research project requests the restrictive microdata files of the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC), and the Numident File.  Using available data, we will use multiple regression designs to explore the long-run impacts of lead exposure, and release estimates of main coefficients of interest only for sizeable groups of county-year cells that do not violate proper disclosure practices. We will work closely with our administrator and/or other administrators to choose consistent sample restrictions and eliminate all disclosure risks."
