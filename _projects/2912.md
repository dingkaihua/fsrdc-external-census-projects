abstract: "The early childcare labor market provides a crucial service to working families; however, these workers are continuously undersupplied and underpaid. The complicated nature of early childcare including the range of sectors (informal, family daycare homes, childcare centers, Head Start, and state-funded Pre-K) each with their own state-level operating requirements has led to fragmented data collections making national studies on this industry scarce. We create an innovative, comprehensive panel of the near universe of childcare establishments and workers from 1994 to 2025 by connecting a rich externally collected national dataset of childcare establishments to restricted-use Census data from the Longitudinal Business Database, Integrated Longitudinal Business Database, County Business Patterns Business Register, Master Address File Extract, and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). 

Using this dataset, we explore national trends in the early childcare labor market and examine how wage shocks affect labor market outcomes. We show how compensation, turnover, educational requirements, and reliance on social supports has shifted over time for workers across each early childcare sector. We then run difference-in-difference models using variation in minimum wage laws to determine how changes in compensation affect equilibrium outcomes, such as industry turnover, for this labor market at the individual and establishment level. We run regression discontinuities exploiting contiguous county pairs to tighten these estimates and ensure consistent estimates. Finally, we run distributed lag models to determine how these effects change over time. We expect to find the greatest change in the family daycare and childcare center markets, with decreased turnover and increasing employment levels."
