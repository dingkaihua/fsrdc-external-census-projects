abstract: "The project will study the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the composition of privately funded research. It will aim to provide a causal explanation for the counter-cyclical behavior of basic research observed in aggregate data. Its findings will also be used to reassess the effect of short-term economic fluctuations on technological development and growth. To do that, we will combine Census data from BRDIS, SIRD, LBD, and QFR, with data we provide from Compustat, and USPTO. We will impute for no-response using multiple imputations, test for causal connections using regression, and investigate macroeconomic dynamics by calibrating a novel endogenous growth model.

Our hypothesis is that weak demands induce firms to shift from launching new products, through applied research, to building ability to innovate, through basic research. Empirically, we expect to find that, controlling for confounders, there is a negative correlation between a firm investment in basic research and the predicted demand for its new products. Also, we expect the data to validate our novel endogenous growth model that implies that downturns are followed by rapid technological innovation. The project may contribute to the literature by providing evidence that downturns are beneficial for future technological development and growth, in stark contrast with the dominant view that assets that they are inimical to both. Also, the project will provide new insights into firms' R&D strategy and the considerations which inform it."
