abstract: "This project uses the American Community Survey (ACS) to study migration in and out of New Orleans (NOLA) following Hurricane Katrina. The analysis explores the demographic, social, and economic composition of annual in- and out-migration flows, examining changes in their age, sex, race, ethnicity, place of birth, education, marital status, and income in the composition. These are analyzed in relation to change in the composition of the New Orleans population. The project uses data from the ACS for the entire country, measuring current residents and in-migrants and out-migrants from their responses to the question about place of residence one year ago and, among movers, the locations of those places. By calculating and using propensity score weights, the researchers will assess the composition and completeness of the ACS and provide an indication of possible strengths and weaknesses in the coverage of the ACS for migration analyses."
