abstract: "We examine the extent to which credit shocks affect firm creation and economic growth using two large shocks to credit: the introduction of bank-branch deregulation laws across US states from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, and the recent financial crisis. Although there is consensus in the literature that a more efficient financial sector allows for a better allocation of resources towards more-productive firms, spurring aggregate productivity and economic growth, most research only considers established firms, ignoring the creation of new firms. We analyze how credit shocks impact entry and exit of firms, as well as the productivity, size, and debt structure of firms that enter, and how such conditions persist over time. We do so by combining the Longitudinal Business Database, which tracks entry and exit for the universe of employer establishments and firms, with the Quarterly Financial Report, which includes balance sheet and income statement information for privately-owned firms, as well as local CRA lending data, Compustat financials, and the Economic Census. Finally, we combine our estimates with standard aggregate productivity decompositions to measure the extent to which these forces, and forces unrelated to credit supply, affect aggregate productivity growth."
