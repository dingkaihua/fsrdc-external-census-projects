abstract: "The structure of the American economy has changed substantially over the past 40 years. The manufacturing sector accounted for more than 25 percent of the labor force in 1970; it accounts for less than 10 percent now. Technological innovation and international trade have contributed to the evolution of the American economy and firms continue to change and evolve through innovation and international trade and investment. A key question is whether the US statistical system has kept pace with the structural changes in the US economy and whether existing data products adequately measure and document these important changes."
