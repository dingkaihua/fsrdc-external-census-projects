abstract: "This research investigates the impact of unemployment insurance extensions during and in the aftermath of the Great Recession on the quality of jobs obtained by jobseekers. The working hypothesis is that workers in states that had longer duration of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits worked in jobs with higher quality and were able to find jobs better matched to their abilities. While it is well established that workers take longer to search for jobs if they have access to generous unemployment insurance benefits, their post-unemployment outcomes have not been carefully analyzed in the United States. Only a handful of papers examine the impact of UI on post-employment wages in Austria and Germany. Our study is the first analysis to examine the impact of UI on the quality of jobs and the quality of job matches. We use Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data that provides employer-employee matched data. This allows removing observed and unobserved worker and firm characteristics and to define the quality of the job as the wages of jobs in a firm that cannot be accounted for by the characteristics of the job or the workers in that firm themselves. These data also allow examining the wages of matches between worker and firm that cannot be accounted by these characteristics."
