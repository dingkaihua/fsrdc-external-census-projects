abstract: "Our proposed study evaluates the degree of information aggregation selected by management in a firm’s published financial statements. This project will study the way financial data within a firm are grouped in the Compustat Database to the way they are grouped in the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and the Enterprise Summary Report (ES9100). Compustat is a database of information from firms’ published financial statements, whereas the LRD and the LBD contain establishment-level data reported to the U.S. Census Bureau by firms and collected from administrative records. The ES9100 provides aggregated firm information as reported by the firm to the Census Bureau. Firms have considerable discretion in how they aggregate business information when preparing their published financial statements. Thus, comparing these data to the more detailed establishment-level data will shed light on how discretion affects the aggregation of information by firms in general. Further, the project will assess the impact of this aggregation on industry classification. While many factors likely affect management’s aggregation decision, economic theory suggests two phenomena are particularly pertinent: proprietary costs and agency costs. Proprietary costs result from revealing proprietary information to competitors, suppliers, employees, customers, or other groups; our focus in this study will be on competitive proprietary costs. Shareholders incur agency costs when they delegate decision-making authority to agents (managers) whose interests are not fully aligned with those of the shareholders. Thus, investigating the impact of proprietary costs and agency costs on the aggregation of information in published financial statements is a central issue in our research proposal. "
