abstract: "This research examines how a public health crisis affects firm entry and exit, entrepreneurship, innovation, and self-employment. Specifically, the researchers consider the following questions, where local economies will be observed via region-level firm dynamism, entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and self-employment rates. How does local opioid use affect local economies, and how has the COVID crisis affected local economies? The researchers will first estimate the effects of specific public health crises - the opioid crisis and COVID pandemic - on local economies through their effects on firm dynamism. The researchers will then conduct a series of analyses that examine the interactive effects of local economic conditions and public health crises on those economies."
