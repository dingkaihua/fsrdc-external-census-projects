abstract: "The goal of this research is to examine the relationship between Hispanic origin and race reporting and estimate how social networks associated with immigrant enclaves influence labor market outcomes. We will examine the effect of ethnic concentrations on both earnings and employment in several high-immigration states (California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas) using the 1-in-6 sample of the 1990 and 2000 U.S. census. The large number of observations in these samples allows us to focus on broad ethnic categories (e.g., South American and Mexican, East Asian and Pacific Islander, Southwest Asian and African, and European and Russian) as well as specific ethnicities (e.g., Mexican, Chinese, Indian, etc.) that cannot be analyzed with more readily available public-use data.  In order to analyze the enclave effect, we will estimate a series of individual-level wage (and employment) equations that control for years since migration, cohort-specific effects, and other observable human capital and demographic characteristics. Wage and employment equations will be estimated for each ethnic group and a measure that captures the proportion of the individualâ€™s census tract that is populated by a particular ethnic group will be introduced into the model. The results of this study will provide an understanding of the relationship between race and ethnic information collected by the decennial census and will identify possible problems in cur-rent data collection strategies. In addition, the wage equations will provide valuable population parameter estimates of returns to observable human capital and social capital in immigrant communities."
