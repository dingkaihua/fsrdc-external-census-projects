abstract: "This project analyzes the effects of local discretionary subsidies on worker-level outcomes in the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure files. How does winning a subsidy competition affect the wages and employment status of local workers compared to workers in runner-up locations? Using a newly assembled dataset on the universe of establishment entry and expansion decisions linked to local incentives (Slattery, 2020), the project will be the first to produce comprehensive estimates of the distributional effects of these prominent place-based policies at the worker level. The research design compares the outcomes of individuals in localities that win "Million Dollar Plants" with those of individuals in localities that are the runner-up in the competition for the plant. This quasi-experimental design uses the individuals in the runner-up locations to identify what would have happened to individuals in the winning location absent the new establishment entry."
