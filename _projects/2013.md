abstract: "The child care represented by public school provision has likely played an important role in fostering large increases in maternal employment over the last 50 years. But since compulsory five-day schooling significantly predates this increase, identifying the strength of this causal relationship has been difficult. To gain a better understanding, this project estimates the household employment effects of a permanent decrease in the weekly days of schooling provided throughout the year among districts adopting the “four-day school week.” This change breaks the tight traditional linkage between the school week and the work week and reduces annual days of schooling provided to children by as much as 8 weeks. The project will also generate both summary statistics of family characteristics and causal estimates of employment and earnings outcomes among parents of young children, an important component of the overall labor force, in response to a public policy change."
