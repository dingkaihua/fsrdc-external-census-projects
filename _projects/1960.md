abstract: "This project will study the impact of right-to-work laws on firms’ labor characteristics including employment, wages, and firms’ financial characteristics including market value, profitability, leverage, cash holdings, R&D, and other investments. We plan to analyze the recent right-to-work legislation as a natural experiment, using a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DiDiD) method which compares public firms in the states that recently passed right-to-work laws with firms in non-right-to-work states and with firms in states that adopted right-to-work laws decades ago. With the legislation change as an exogenous shift, we will be able to obtain a clean identification of the effects of labor unions on firms’ financial decisions, employment, and performance."
