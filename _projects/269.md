abstract: "The growing literature on the productivity impact of information technology has revealed that while IT produces large benefits on average, there is usually a significant amount of variation in its firm-level effects. Researchers have turned to organizational differences between firms to help explain this variation, arguing that in many cases there are complementarities between the use of IT and the organization of the enterprise. The empirical challenge is to deal with the problems of endogenous technology adoption and unobserved firm-level heterogeneity that are present in most productivity studies.

The adoption of computerized dispatching technology by taxicab fleets provides a unique opportunity to examine the issue of complementarities between economic organization and technology adoption. The taxicab industry contains a large number of firms delivering a relatively homogeneous good and computerized dispatch technology has had a major impact on the productivity of taxi fleets. Moreover, the contracting between taxi drivers and fleet operators (i.e. whether drivers are employees or contractors) is a significant organization decision that should influence the IT adoption decision. Finally, differences in local regulatory and market conditions provide a source of exogenous variation in the costs and benefits of IT use and different modes of driver contracting.

This project proposes to utilize establishment level data on taxi and livery fleets to test for complementarities between driver contracting and the use of computerized dispatch technology. The econometric tests will include traditional approaches, such as production function estimation, as well as a novel structural method that jointly estimates a production function and the choice of contracting mode.
