abstract: "The purpose of this project is two-fold: 1) To exploit information on voting patterns from NLRB representation elections to generate quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of certification and unionization on business establishment survival and employment using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), and 2) to assess the reliability of both the LRD employment variable as well as its record linkage over time using an alternative and independent measure obtained from a commercially-available establishment-level database on survival and employment levels."
