abstract: "Social scientists have long observed that labor-market outcomes and the accumulation of human capital are closely related to decisions about fertility. Yet much is still unknown about the way families balance the responsibilities of child-bearing, child-rearing, and career planning. Less still is known about the potential spillover effects on firms, co-workers, and social networks. This project will enhance Census data products and advance the academic literature by using Census household roster data to link family members to one another, allowing information on household relationships to be incorporated in analyses using the LEHD and other large-scale administrative data. We will use these linked data to study the relationship between child-bearing and the demographic, social, and economic characteristics of parents, their co-workers, and firms."
