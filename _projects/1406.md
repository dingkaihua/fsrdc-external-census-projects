abstract: "This project will determine the extent to which environmental, energy, and other types of regulation regimes influence firm-level production. Much economic research on environmental regulation and environmental goods compares how “clean” versus “dirty” industries respond to different regulatory or economic forces. However, using firm- and plant-level data, this project recognizes that even within a narrowly defined industry, firms differ enormously in the quantity and mix of pollutants that they emit, in the stringency of regulations they face, in productivity, trade exposure, market power, product quality, input mix, and product mix. Some of these differences may reflect measurement error and/or idiosyncratic productivity shocks, but others reflect fundamental economic forces. This project will investigate the relationship between firms and environmental regulatory regimes over the past 40 years."
