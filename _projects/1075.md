abstract: "Despite the Americans with Disabilities Act and enormous advances in assistive technology, employment rates for people with disabilities have declined. This project will model the employment of working-age people with disabilities as a function of their individual characteristics and local environment. Using the restricted access geographic identifiers in the American Community Survey, Current Population Survey, and Survey of Income and Program Participation, this research will examine variation both across and within geographic areas to identify the effect of different individual and environmental characteristics on employment. These characteristics include health conditions, the specific nature of the disability, demographics, unearned income, human capital, family characteristics, policy variables, local infrastructure, and local economic conditions."
