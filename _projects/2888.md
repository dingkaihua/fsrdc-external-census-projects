abstract: "In recent years, the study of economic mobility has taken off, a development that's been fueled in the main by analyses of tax data. The study of occupational mobility has, by contrast, languished because the available surveys are too small to reliably estimate recent trends. We are accordingly left with a shortage of evidence on (a) trends in occupational mobility, (b) cross-group differences in occupational mobility, and (c) the relationship between occupational mobility and other types of mobility (e.g., educational, economic). The National Research Council's (NRC) Standing Committee on Creating the American Opportunity Study has recommended that the Data Linkage Infrastructure (DLI), which links individuals across Decennial Censuses, the ACS, and the CPS, serve as the country's new data resource for monitoring occupation mobility. It is accordingly critical to understand the methodological costs and benefits of relying on the DLI for this purpose. We do so by "stress testing" the range of topics that occupational mobility researchers will want to carry out with this new infrastructure (e.g., trends in mobility; racial and ethnic variability in mobility; gender-based variability in mobility; family structure and mobility, and the relationship between economic, income, and education mobility). These analyses will be based on the 2007-21 American Community Surveys and the 2000 Decennial Census (as well as earlier Decennial Censuses insofar as the DLI completes their work with them and can make them available)."
