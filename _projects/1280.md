abstract: "Technological progress and innovation is arguably the largest factor that drives long-run economic growth. Many studies have shown that increasing competition from lowering trade barriers enhances efficiency and increases overall TFP growth. Nearly all these studies found that with an increase in competition, large productivity gains can be observed in the data, and that these gains account for a majority of the overall industry gains. However, the underlining mechanism that drives the overall TFP gain is not clear. A primary objective of this research is to examine the effect of increased trade-induced competition pressure and energy costs on technology adoption behavior of establishments. This research examines whether an increase in technology adoption is a main channel for an increase in TFP when firms face rising competitive pressure or rising energy costs. This research uses various empirical strategies to quantify the technology adoption response to a change in international trade environment as well as a change in domestic energy market environment."
