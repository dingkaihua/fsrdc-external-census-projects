abstract: "The project investigates 1) whether mortgage lenders take into account neighborhood risk when they decide whether to grant or deny a credit, and 2) whether neighborhood risk thereby affects homeownership decisions.  These hypotheses can be tested using a direct measure for neighborhood specific risk from Hilber (2001) and using census-track specific mortgage lending decision data (HMDA-data) and data from the AHS that discloses the census-track of a housing unit.  We can also test whether mortgage lending denials or portfolio diversification considerations are the main reason for why neighborhood risk affects the homeownership decision."
