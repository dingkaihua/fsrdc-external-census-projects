abstract: "The central purpose of this research is to examine the influence of social capital on entrepreneurship (in the form of self-employment). Social capital (SK) can be defined as “the societal analogue of physical or economic capital—the value inherent in friendship networks and other associations that individuals and groups can draw upon to achieve private or collective objectives.” Previous literature indicates that community and individual SK is important in determining who becomes an entrepreneur. However, much of the previous analyses used small samples sizes or weak measures of social capital. In this research, we will use the 2000 Decennial Census, the 2000 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, and an external data set, the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), to address the following questions: (1) What types of social capital (structural or cognitive) are more important in predicting self-employment, both at the individual and community levels? (2) How important is the role of social capital in the transition between paid employment or unemployment to self-employment? (3) In the transition to self-employment, how does social capital influence an individual to remain in the same occupation or industry? We will also explore how the results vary across rural and urban environments and natives versus immigrants to assess how relationships between social capital and entrepreneurial activity differ across demographic and geographic dimensions.
