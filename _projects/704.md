abstract: "Immigration of Asians and Hispanics has fueled recent growth in the non-White population in the United States. As of 2000, 31 percent of the population was of a group other than non-Hispanic White, up from nearly 25 percent a decade earlier. The inﬂux of immigrants, particularly to metropolitan areas, is changing the demographics of America’s neighborhoods. The ﬁrst part of this project examines the relationship between individual race/ethnicity, nativity, and human capital characteristics with levels of neighborhood economic advantage and racial diversity. Often termed residential or locational attainment, this research investigates the eﬀectiveness of spatial assimilation and place stratiﬁcation theories for understanding racial and ethnic stratiﬁcation across neighborhoods. The second portion of the analysis explores the relationship between metropolitan context and locational attainment. Metropolitan-level residential segregation indexes by race and ethnicity will be developed, and the relationship between metropolitan characteristics (segregation and ecological factors) and locational attainment will be examined."
