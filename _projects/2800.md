abstract: "While innovation production is highly spatially concentrated, inventors are increasingly working in teams with co-inventors from other regions. What are the roles of agglomeration and inter-city networks in the production and diffusion of innovation, and hence in determining the aggregate impacts of the spatial distribution of inventors in the US? 

In this project, I first quantify agglomeration economies in innovation production across cities via inter-city innovation networks, including patent co-inventor networks, patent citation networks, and inventor migration networks. Innovations produced at different locations, however, have differential impacts on broader society. I then quantify the impact of innovations produced on productivity in different regions via the same inter-city innovation networks, and the impact of inventor in-migration on the subsequent skill mix of the region.

To examine the aggregate impact on innovation production, I build a parsimonious spatial model with endogenous agglomeration forces that spillover across cities. I then endogenize the formation of co-inventor networks via the search and matching of inventors in different locations to illustrate how falling communication costs impacts the spatial networks of inventors. I embed these spatial networks of innovation into a quantitative dynamic urban and trade model that incorporates the migration of inventors and workers and endogenous amenities in each region that varies with the skill mix of the city. I simulate this full model to quantify the general equilibrium welfare impacts of different inventor migration costs, falling communication costs, and place-based innovation policies."
