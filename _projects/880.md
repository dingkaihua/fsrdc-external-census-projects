abstract: "The goal of this project is to provide insights into the microeconomic underpinnings and effects of business cycles. A key goal is to extend the existing literature by examining the effects of the recent "great recession" and the consequent (ongoing) recovery. Another goal is to examine these issues for firms operating in the retail and service sectors. Most of the literature to date has focused on manufacturing industries, which represent a decreasing portion of GDP in the U.S. and other developed economies. The project will consist of three main parts. First, we will study the effects of business cycles on entry and exit of employer establishments, as well as transitions between non-employer and employer status, controlling for the effect of other important variables such as area demographics, establishment as well as industry characteristics, market size, and regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to entry. Second, we will study the impact of the business cycle and local financial conditions on investment behavior as well as business growth. Finally, we will study how firm pricing decisions vary over the business cycle. Our primary sources of data will be the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (ILBD), the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) and the Current Industrial Reports (CIR) maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau, which we will complement with other public use data to which we have access.
