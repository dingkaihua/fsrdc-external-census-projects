abstract: "This research uses restricted-use microdata from the 1970-2000 Decennial Censuses and 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) to validate methods for estimating small area totals from public Census data and to evaluate the nature of disclosure protection present in the existing public data. The methodology developed and to be implemented by the research team generates sampling weights for allocating household records in the Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) to a given census tract. This methodology will allow users to combine public data in order to create population estimates with increased spatial resolution at the expense of increased statistical uncertainty. Such a tradeoff is desirable in many situations, and allowing researchers to choose between precision and uncertainty will increase the utility of publicly available Census data. In the process of the analysis, the researchers will also create a synthetic dataset from exclusively public sources, allowing them to assess the degree of disclosure protection present in existing public use samples."
