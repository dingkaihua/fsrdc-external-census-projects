abstract: "The Great Depression in the 1930s was the most important economic downturn in modern history. Prices went down by 27% (BLS), Unemployment rose by 25%, and one-third of the banks at the moment failed (Richardson 2007). In 1933, President Roosevelt decided to approve several programs for relief and recovery to overcome the great depression, the New Deal. Yet, there is scant literature exploring the long-term effects of the New Deal relief spending on health outcomes. This project will study the long-term effects of the New Deal relief spending on longevity by exploiting county-level variation on the New Deal spending by program while accounting for the severity of the crisis. It will further investigate mechanism through which New Deal spending may influence longevity and explore heterogeneous effects by cohort, gender and Socio-Economic Status."
