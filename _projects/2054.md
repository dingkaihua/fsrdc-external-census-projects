abstract: "The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of race/ethnicity, household characteristics and environment, and census tract, county, and state-level social and economic characteristics on voluntary and involuntary migration. The project will also produce estimates of the total U.S. population, stratified by race and ethnicity, that migrates over various distances and provide an analysis of the factors influencing this migration. In attempting to explain the rise of intrastate migration and reduced rate of interstate migration, researchers have highlighted the importance of both economic and non-economic factors. However, many of these factors are theorized to operate at more localized geographical levels than are available in public data. This has led to a dearth of research capable of examining the relative importance of economic and social factors on internal migration among major racial and ethnic groups. To analyze the neighborhood-level dynamics that theoretically drive differences in migration patterns, researchers must be able to identify the neighborhood of residence of individuals and households, as well as the aggregate characteristics of these places. Restricted Census data will be used to examine both inter- and instar-state migration dynamics at an appropriate unit of analysis."
