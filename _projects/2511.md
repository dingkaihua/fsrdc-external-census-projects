abstract: "This project will examine the long-term changes to productivity, employment and worker wages of firms that are acquired by private equity. The central contribution of this project will be to examine how and why ownership by both private owners and by public shareholders along with real and financial factors impacts public and private (both private equity and non-private equity) firms differently in their growth, productivity, and employment over time. We examine the impact of real and financial factors to initial acquisition decisions by comparing the participation of public and private firms in merger waves and their outcomes.  We will then track productivity, employment and worker wages over time. Using plant-level data on a sample of firms over the 1963 period to the present period, we will examine the long term outcomes over five to ten years subsequent to buyouts and purchases by private equity firms and compare these to the same outcomes for firms that are publicly traded. We also will investigate the outcomes and employment of workers based on their personal credit to examine how workers fare after separation from private equity backed firms.

We will also investigate whether the financial resources along with innovative activity in the  industry and by the firm, measured by industry R&D and the number and significance of patents, affect the firm's choice to be privately (with private equity backing and without private equity backing) or publicly held. Such an effect might arise for several reasons. First, growth of seasoned firms and also exploitation of innovations might require external financing. External financing needs of individual firms will also depend on industry characteristics and stage in the industry life-cycle. Thus, they will be a function of aggregate industry investment relative to aggregate cash generated. Second, the exploitation of growth and technological opportunities may require different amount of monitoring by investors, and hence might affect the organizational form of the business --- private firm or a public firm (a division of a public firm or a stand-alone public firm), holding the need for external funds constant.

In light of recent events pertaining to the COVID-19 crisis, we further plan to understand how large and small private equity owned businesses and non-private equity owned firms (both privately held and publicly traded) have fared along with their employees. We will extend the project to examine these business - both private equity owned, non-public non private equity and publicly traded firms - over the COVID-19 to study the effects of liquidity and demand shocks on labor outcomes and business outcomes (including subsequent earnings, hiring patterns, innovation, IPOs, and mergers), and credit outcomes (bankruptcies, foreclosure, student loan default, etc.), as well as feedback effects to the general macroeconomy."
