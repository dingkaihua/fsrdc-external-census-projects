abstract: "This research will examine how human capital influences startup performance. In particular, the research will study how the prior experience and backgrounds of founders and other employees interact with three different phenomena--startup employee departures, startup hiring distributions, and previous periods of unemployment for startup founders--and how such interactions influence startup performance on metrics such as sales and survival."
