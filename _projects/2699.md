abstract: "Past research has attempted to estimate the impact that business closures have on local economies and labor markets, but these efforts have been hampered by limited public data availability and a lack of linked employer-employee data. The current study combines external, open-source mapping data with restricted establishment and worker-level data from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), County Business Patterns Business Register (CBPBR), and Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) files to assess the impacts of such closures in very small areas called Hyper-Local Economic Ecosystems, or HLEEs. Using a synthetic controls design to compare HLEEs that do and do not experience closures over a given period, we can estimate how closures impact other local businesses, assess how these impacts differ by business type (such as in/out of sector of the closing business), and extend these findings to worker and resident outcomes that have not been explored previously."
