abstract: "Many rural communities are losing economically and socially viable populations, tax bases, essential services, and retail establishments. But, there are also cases of rural communities that are thriving and, in doing so, are retaining their populations and stemming the tide of rural out-migration. Our proposed research will evaluate the factors that aid rural communities in retaining their population. Specifically this research will analyze the effect of the civic institution in rural communities (such as churches, local businesses and local associations) upon individuals – probabilities of staying in their communities. Individual migration/nonmigration behavior will be modeled using the full internal decennial microdata for 1990 and 2000 (as it becomes available). County contextual effects on these individual behaviors will be modeled using internal Economic Census microdata from 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997 as well as from publicly available county level data (such as the Census of Agriculture). The individual models will summarize the effects of individual economic, demographic and social characteristics that affect migration/nonmigration behavior. County contextual effects will quantify the influence of community economic conditions and social conditions that alter these individual behavioral models. Assessment of these contextual estimates will summarize the degree to which community structure alters individual behavior. Thus our research objectives are first to specify the relationship between rural community context and individual migration behavior, and second to test the relative importance of individual characteristics, community economic characteristics and community social characteristics in retaining rural populations. Our approach will also provide a number of benefits to the US Census Bureau. These benefits include linking decennial and economic data over time at the county level and linking the decennial time series and economic census time series on counties together. Further we will provide an important alternative measurement for migration in these data, by evaluating two measures of migration – cross county migration and cross labor market migration. This latter definition may provide a clear demarcation between purely residential movements within a community and economically determined movements between communities. Comparison of predictive estimates for the two types of migration will quantify these differences. We believe our project will also provide an important quality assessment of the 2000 decennial data. By linking 1990 to 2000 data, then modeling individual migration behaviors (and relevant characteristics) we will provide a unique quality assessment of the 2000 data. Our research approach models individual behaviors at the county level and assesses contextual differences among counties in these predicted behaviors. As we evaluate the stability of individual migration behavior within each county in 1990 and 2000 we will identify counties where sharp changes in our predictive models occur, and assess whether such differences are due to changes in contextual conditions or are artifacts of Census coverage in the two time periods."
