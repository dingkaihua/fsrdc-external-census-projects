abstract: "In the proposed research, we seek to enhance knowledge on hate crime by circumventing police-based data on hate crimes with multilevel data from a restricted version of the area-identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to examine the relationship between contextual features of places and the risk of hate crime victimization and reporting. Specifically, we will examine whether the likelihood of hate crime victimization and reporting associates with contextual characteristics for all racial/ethnic/gender categories. In addition, we will investigate whether the potential effects of contextual characteristics are different by race, ethnicity, and gender, and whether the possible relationships between the race/ethnicity of the victim and the race/ethnicity of the offender and hate crime victimization and reporting are conditioned by the contextual characteristics. Drawing upon the literature and theory of hate crime victimization and reporting, we develop hypotheses regarding the relationships between hate crime victimization and reporting and contextual characteristics. To achieve our goals, we will combine data on hate crime victimization and crime reporting from the 2005-2015 NCVS and community-/county-/state-level data from multiple sources, including the publicly available Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement. We will analyze these data using the survey Heckprobit selection model. The results of this analysis will generate information that can be used to address an expanded set of concerns related to hate crime victimization and reporting, to inform public policy decisions, and to analyze public programs that pertain specifically to hate crime victimization and reporting."
