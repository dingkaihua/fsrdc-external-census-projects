abstract: "Economic theory suggests that trading firms should be particularly dependent on external and internal financing due to issues such as long shipment lags, currency and regulatory risks, and high initial fixed costs to set up a distribution network abroad. This implies that firms with tighter credit constraints should be significantly less likely to export to a given destination (extensive margin) and have significantly lower export shares (intensive margin) than comparable, but financially unconstrained, firms. However, existing strategies fail to document how financial constraints determine trade shares because they lack firm-level microdata. By making use of linked Economic Census, Quarterly Financial Report, LFTTD, and Compustat data, we can more directly measure firm-level constraints and determine how biased standard techniques for assessing this relationship at the industry-level have been. Results will better characterize the true contribution of financing constraints on trade shares in the US economy.  "
