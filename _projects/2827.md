abstract: "Our project examines the economic impact of the tariff exclusions granted to U.S. firms in the wake of the tariffs wave initiated in 2018. First, we will document some summary statistics about the tariff exclusions process, and some stylized facts about the determinants of tariff exclusions. We then aim to examine how tariff exclusions affected U.S. firms' import behavior, i.e., how product sourcing decisions changed in response to the tariff removal. Lastly, we plan to examine how firms' economic performance has evolved after an approval or a denial of an exclusion request, i.e., we will investigate how firms reorganized their production process by changing employment and investment, and how that has affected firms' performance, such as productivity, revenues, and market value."
