abstract: "We aim to examine the labor force restructuring that occurs around mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Specifically, we aim to quantify the proportion of the target premium that can be attributed to labor-related cost synergies. We propose a new methodology which takes into account both the duplicate and the perpetual nature of labor changes during acquisitions, including job continuations, additions, and eliminations. The unique establishment level data available through several Census datasets, including the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which accounts for labor-related restructuring in continuing, new, and closed establishments, can allow for this analysis. In addition to estimating the proportion of target premium associated with the M&A-related labor restructuring, we aim to quantify the actual labor-related restructuring around M&As and document general trends related to remaining and new employees, to periods inside and outside of recessions and to different acquisition types."
