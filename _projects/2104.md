abstract: "This project aims to understand the demand for different types of workers from firms in the United States (US), as well as produce estimates that provide insight into how skilled workers sort across firms, how firms compete in recruiting them and the potential benefits of recruiting different types of workers. The project consists of two parts, each using a difference-in-differences framework as well as panel and instrumental variable specifications to explore the different effects of local and national labor market shocks on firm outcomes. The first part of the project will examine how different types of firms need access to specialized labor from other countries and how foreign labor affects technological diffusion, trade patterns and location decisions. The second part will look more broadly at the demand for all types of workers (not just high-skilled immigrants) and evaluate how local shocks to the labor and education markets affect firm location decisions, worker sorting, within firm wage distribution, and productivity."
