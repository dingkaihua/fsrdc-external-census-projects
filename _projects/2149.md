abstract: "According to the Census Bureau, 26.6 percent of all children under 21 did not live with both parents in 2013 (Grall, 2016). Because of the large number of children affected, and because they tend to be disproportionately poor, a lot of thought goes into how much child support these families should receive from the noncustodial parent. In particular, economic theory predicts that receipt of child support should reduce the custodial parents' (mothers for simplicity) incentives to work, in the same way that public transfers do.
Despite the welfare implications of the reduction in work incentives, the literature on how child support affects mothers' labor supply is relatively small. Earlier papers are limited in their ability to handle endogeneity, relying mainly on father-side information and cross-state differences in the legal environment as a source of exogenous variation. Two recent papers provide more causal estimates. Cuesta & Cancian (2015) exploit the experimental design of the Wisconsin Child Support Demonstration Evaluation and find that child support did not have a labor supply effect for mothers on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Rossin-Slater & WÅ±st (2016) exploit the Danish child support formula's dependence on income and number of children to construct a simulated instrument, and finds no effect on mothers' labor supply. 
This project differentiates from the two by, firstly using a different source of variation, and secondly examining a different population. In particular, it aims to provide a causal estimate for the general population of mothers receiving support in the US. 
For a causal estimate, this project will exploit the dependence of child support payments on children age in a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design. In order to implement this, month-level details on marriage and fertility (suppressed in public-use data) from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) will be needed. "
