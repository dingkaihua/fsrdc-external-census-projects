abstract: "Recent research has attempted to determine the net effects of international trade on the U.S. economy. We aim to determine which types of jobs and industries are most impacted by international trade, and in particular how China’s accession to the World Trade Organization has impacted U.S. earnings and employment among firms that engage with international companies in a variety of ways. By combining data from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics, Economic Censuses, and the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database, we observe job transitions among workers with skills and firms that are heterogeneous in their susceptible-to-trade shocks. Using a two-sided matching model, we are able to estimate how job matches change in response to these shocks, both directly as a result of foreign competition and indirectly in response to effects on other industries. Results thus generate a comprehensive account of “winners” and “losers” from foreign trade."
