abstract: "This project will develop methods that use information from restricted-access Census Bureau data to characterize risk across populations. Work will demonstrate that using restricted-access Census data to develop and test risk assessment methods in conjunction with public data provide superior measures than could be accomplished with public data alone. Research will use the American Community Survey and the American Community Survey Multiyear Estimates Study data in conjunction with other public-use geospatial data. With these combined data sources, the researchers will create several geospatial risk-scapes, each measuring a different dimension of population risk to health hazards, economic hazards, or natural disasters. The researchers will then use these risk-scape measures to demonstrate the utility of the Census microdata in timely assessment of social vulnerability."
