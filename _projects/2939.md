abstract: "The number of American grandparents living with grandchildren under age 18 in the same household has increased from 2.3 million in 1980 to 7 million in 2011-2013. Among these grandparents in 2019, 2.3 million provided custodial care of their coresident grandchildren, and about 1.3 million were still in the labor force to support their grandchildren. Previous research has documented the prevalence and trends of grandparents raising their coresident grandchildren. This project adds to the literature by examining the short-term and long-term mortality risks among coresident grandparents. To examine short-term mortality risks, we will identify coresident grandparents (and their caregiving responsibility) in the 2019-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) samples. We will then use the restricted Protected Identification Keys (PIKs) to link them to their death records from the 2022 Numident file. To examine long-term mortality risks, we will identify coresident grandparents (and their caregiving responsibility) in the 2000 Census long-form sample. We will again the restricted PIKs to link these coresident grandparents to their death records from the 2022 Numident file. For both short-term and long-term mortality risks, we will conduct descriptive and regression-based survival analyses to estimate the associations between different levels of coresident grandparenting (ranging from no caregiving to caring for grandchildren for 5 years or longer) and mortality. We will also examine the variations in these associations by race-ethnicity, gender, and immigration status."
