abstract: "Research often shows that Blacks tend to experience the greatest disparity in gaining access into White neighborhoods, often residing in areas inferior to other minorities. This research uses Decennial Census and American Community Survey microdata to assess the impact individual (i.e., race) and social (i.e., socioeconomic status) characteristics have on Black residential outcomes over time. Two questions guide this study: (1) To what extent do individual and social characteristics affect Black residential outcomes over time? (2) Stratified by nativity, to what degree do individual and social characteristics affect foreign-born Black residential outcomes? The outcome variables are neighborhood racial/ethnic composition and neighborhood socioeconomic status. "
