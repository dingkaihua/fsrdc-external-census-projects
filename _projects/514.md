abstract: "This project expands the notion of within-industry heterogeneity in plant size beyond variation in productivity to include variation in function. The main idea is that small plants tend to do different things than large plants; in particular, they specialize in custom work or retail-like activity that is often efficiently undertaken in small plants. This project studies the relationship between plant size and plant function by 1) constructing measures of dispersion across product lines within an industry across size classes; 2) looking for evidence that small plants engage in more custom and retail-like activity; 3) looking at variation in market areas within narrowly defined industries; and 4) determining the extent to which changes in the distribution of manufacturing establishments at a location parallel changes in the retail sector. The proposed project will bene-fit the U.S. Census Bureau through the tabulation of new statistics on the population of manufacturing establishments. These statistics will contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the industrial classifications used by the Census Bureau. The proposed analysis of industry definitions is of particular interest at this time because of the major shift from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) between the 1992 and 1997 Economic Censuses; this analysis will provide quantitative results on how the switch from SIC to NAICS affected the relationship between plant function and plant size within narrowly defined industries. In the longer run, the limitations of the industrial classification systems that we identify may aid in the design of future classification systems. The statistics tabulated in this project will also improve our understanding of the quality of the export data collected in the Census of Manufactures and Commodity Flow Survey (CFS); in particular, we will use the information in the CFS data to learn whether the well-known understatement of exports in the Census of Manufactures reflects a failure to correctly report export status or a failure to correctly report the value of exports."
