abstract: "Using disaggregated data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), Census of Manufactures (CMF), and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) covering 1980-2018, we use a simultaneous equation model to investigate the effect of oil price shocks on labor reallocation for various NAICS coded industries in the United States. In light of recent research, we identify whether the cause of the oil price fluctuations is driven by demand or supply shocks. We expect that more oil dependent industries, such as the auto manufacturing sector, will show higher levels of responsiveness than industries traditionally associated with lower oil use; this change in magnitude, however, should diminish when accounting for supply elasticity and supply or demand driven shocks. While prior research on labor reallocation primarily uses more aggregated data, this masks some of the smaller changes occurring in the labor market. As such, by using data from the Census Bureau we are able to more thoroughly investigate the responsiveness of the labor market by accounting for subindustries based off of NAICS codes and additional characteristics, such as capital intensity, energy intensity, and trade intensity."
