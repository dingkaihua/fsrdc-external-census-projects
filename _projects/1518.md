abstract: "This project aims to gain a better understanding of the market structure of supply chains and the impacts of globalization with a focus on the agricultural sector. Agriculture supply chains involve four stages of production: farming, wholesaling, manufacturing, and retailing. Using a combination of data from the Census Bureau and USDA, this project constructs and analyzes the economic outcomes – market concentration, exports, prices, entry and exit, output and revenue, and the extent of vertical integration – at each stage of the supply chain. The project also examines how these outcomes respond at each stage of production in response to international shocks."
