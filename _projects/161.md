abstract: "The proposed research seeks to study spatial patterns of intrametropolitan job creation and destruction in large urban areas.  The analysis will examine the role of establishment births, deaths, expansions, and contractions in both cities and suburbs.  Comparisons will be made between growing and shrinking areas, and additional analysis will examine the reallocation of employment across different sectors of the economy in the various types of places.  The research will also investigate geographic differences in job quality and will attempt to uncover correlations between the spatial distributions of household characteristics and the details of subsequent employment dynamics."
