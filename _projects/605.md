abstract: "This project has two phases. Central to each component is an innovative framework that will enable us to use cross-sectional data to address certain dynamic questions regarding education. This framework leverages the discontinuity in the year of school entry created by the school entry rules in most states. The 2000 decennial census long form sample is crucial for the implementation of this frame-work.  We will study some of the causal determinants and effects of schooling attainment, using the differences in schooling attainment as of a certain age that are created by the school entry laws.   Our proposed project will yield at least three benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau.  We will develop a modified proxy of the variable “labor market experience”.  We will develop a “modified potential experience” (MPE) variable that is a more accurate proxy for experience than the commonly used PE measure.  As part of the first phase of our project we will use the MPE variable to provide new evidence on the value of additional labor market experience. We intend to estimate the fraction of recent movers who would have responded to the Current Population Survey WHYMOVE question that they moved for reasons of the education of the children. The available responses to the WHYMOVE question exclude this possible answer, despite the fact that many families move to be closer to a desirable school. With the new imputed category, it will be possible to identify people who moved because of education for their children. As part of the second phase of the project we will use data from the census to summarize the characteristics of families who moved for education-related reasons (as opposed to other reasons) and develop reduced form and structural models of the process of residential mobility underlying Tiebout-style choice."
