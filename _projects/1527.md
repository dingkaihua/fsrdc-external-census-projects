abstract: "Wage rigidity has long been hypothesized by many economists as an important amplifier of business cycles, but the empirical evidence on this conjecture is limited. We aim to provide empirical tests of this conjecture by studying the relationship between payroll flexibility and employment and investment volatility at the firmlevel. We will measure pay and wage rigidity precisely in the microdata, and then study how differences in rigidity affect firm employment and investment outcomes in the face of business cycle or industrylevel shocks. Census Bureau datasets are uniquely suited to answer this question, as these data allow for both the ability to precisely measure individual-level pay rigidity as well as link these measures to key firm-level outcomes.
