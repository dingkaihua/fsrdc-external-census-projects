abstract: "This project investigates the reciprocal relationship between residential segregation and the housing landscape--the geographic mix of different tenure types and densities of housing across metropolitan areas. In so doing, the project shifts the focus of segregation research from the demand-side--the renters and homeowners vying for places to live--to the supply side: the landlords, developers, and municipal agencies who transform the housing landscape by permitting, building, renovating, converting, and selling housing. Our goal is to understand how development decisions made by municipal housing agencies, city planners, politicians, developers, and landlords shape housing opportunities, influence patterns of residential mobility, and, in turn, guide processes of residential segregation with respect to race and income. 
This project will combine statistical analyses of household mobility coming from the American Community Survey (ACS) data with urban planning zoning data at either the metropolitan or neighborhood level to implement policy relevant simulations of the housing market that examine the co-evolutionary process linking the segregation of the population to the shifting spatial distribution of the housing landscape."
