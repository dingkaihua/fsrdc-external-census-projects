abstract: "This study aims to document the patterns of health insurance coverage among children in Mexican-immigrant families, comparing Mexican children of immigrants (i.e., children having at least one Mexican immigrant parent) and children with U.S.-born parents, both inter- and intra-ethnically, with particular attention to child and parent documentation status. The project uses the 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008 SIPP panels, including core and topical module files. The restricted-use internal SIPP files provide information regarding immigration status at the time the immigrant respondent arrived in the United States to develop an algorithm for estimating immigrant parent and child documentation in public use files.  Descriptive results, including cumulative proportions experiencing transitions to and from coverage, based on life table analyses, will demonstrate the patterns and trajectories for each comparison group.
