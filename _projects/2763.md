abstract: "Heavy-duty vehicles comprise one-tenth of road vehicles in the U.S. but contribute almost half of local air pollution. An important motivation for electrifying the trucking industry is to relieve the disproportionate burden of local air pollution on disadvantaged communities. We study the role of charging infrastructure in determining the distributional consequences of truck electrification. We first build a micro-founded framework that measures pollution inequality in conjunction with the underlying income inequality. This framework allows us to decompose welfare into income size and inequality, analyze inequality within and between demographic groups, and investigate the long-term effects of inequality given the human capital cost of pollution. To apply this framework to truck electrification, we estimate a transport mode choice model based on Commodity Flow Survey data, simulate which shipments would adopt the electric truck mode under various charging infrastructure designs, and calculate the economic and pollution effects of those adoption patterns.  Our inequality framework then combines those effects of truck electrification with American Community Survey data to quantify the distributional consequences of truck electrification and identify charging infrastructure designs that best support equality and efficiency."
