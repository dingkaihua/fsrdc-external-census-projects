abstract: "Publicly subsidized universal prekindergarten (pre-K) pro-grams have received consider-able attention in recent years as an avenue for both promoting school readiness and providing child care. In this study we will estimate the effects of Pre-K programs on children’s enrollment in preschool and on the labor supply (e.g., hours worked and wages) and welfare receipt of mothers. Each program has an age cutoff for enrollment. The methodology will employ exogenous differences in eligibility across states and from these age restrictions to create ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ groups which will be used to determine program effects. The dataset used will be the 2000 confidential decennial long form sample. The project will produce valuable estimates for use in an academic journal article. Better understanding of family behavior regarding work and child care produced by this project will allow for insight that could change the way the Census Bureau asks its questions regarding early childhood education and care."
