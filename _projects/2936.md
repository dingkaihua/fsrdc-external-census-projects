abstract: "This project will analyze statistical relationships between establishment-level variables from the newly available non-public Comprehensive Startup Panel (CSP) with regional variables, such as demographic and institutional variables, which will be merged to the CSP at the levels of states, counties, and zip codes. Entrepreneurship research has grown rapidly as academics seek to investigate the role of start-ups in innovation and economic growth. Although job creation is one of the most important aspects of entrepreneurship, little is known about the relationships between regional variables and the early-stage hiring decisions of entrepreneurs. The proposed research aims to uncover which regional variables are related to entrepreneurial job creation in different geographies. In particular, five key regional variables could influence the propensity of entrepreneurs to hire workers: minimum wages, the duration of unemployment insurance benefits, Medicaid expansion, Job Creation Tax Credits, and homestead exemptions in personal bankruptcy law. These five regional variables vary across states and time, and minimum wages additionally vary across an increasing number of cities. The regional variables may affect entrepreneurs in different ways across communities that vary by wealth levels and racial and ethnic composition. To enhance our understanding of the large heterogeneity in entrepreneurial outcomes in the nationwide sample, the proposed project will analyze heterogeneous effects of the regional variables by demographic characteristics, which are measured at the levels of counties and zip codes."
