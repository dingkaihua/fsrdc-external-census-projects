abstract: "Improving STEM learning and broadening participation in STEM are essential for growing the economy and remaining globally competitive. Nonetheless, after six decades of federal emphasis, the STEM workforce remains non-representative of the US population. With the federal emphasis often on collective benefits, the individual benefits of STEM degrees and occupations are less clear, whether in terms of socioeconomic attainment or well-being. The individual benefits of STEM degrees and occupations for diverse young adults, those under-represented in STEM, are particularly unclear. The structural and interpersonal characteristics of STEM environments that differentiate individual benefits likely also shape selection and persistence in STEM degrees and occupations. We investigate three broad questions: 1) What aspects of STEM environments (e.g., discipline, field) increase the likelihood that students choose and persist in STEM degrees and STEM occupations? 2) Do STEM degrees and STEM occupations relate to socioeconomic attainment and well-being? 3) How do these relationships vary depending on individuals' social position (SES, race, immigration status, and gender)? We seek to utilize restricted-use data from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) linked to the American Community Survey (ACS). The NSCG is a unique source of extensive information on college graduates' experiences in both undergraduate and graduate school. With its rich measures of labor force outcomes, we will be able to investigate how STEM degrees relate to STEM occupations, and then to socioeconomic attainment. Our focus is also consistent with the aims of the NSCG, investigating trends in employment opportunities and salaries to support the formulation of education and employment policies aimed at modifying scientific and technical curricula and reinforcing the national engines of innovation."
