abstract: "Over the last three decades, the United States has employed several campaigns to bolster economies in low-income areas through economic incentives. Despite this, there is a lack of a consensus on the short-term impacts of these programs and less is known about the long-run impacts. We use detailed data from the U.S. Census and a geographic regression discontinuity research design to better understand the short and long run impacts of the first and largest of these programs, Empowerment Zones. To understand effects of the program on individuals' employment, earnings, and education we analyze these outcomes using the Decennial Census, the Current Population Survey ASEC, and the American Community Survey from 1990-2026. Intergenerational impacts are assessed by linking parents from earlier surveys to their children in later years. Our analysis of outcomes on businesses establishments and firms use the Longitudinal Business Database from 1990-2026 and Economics Census surveys from 1992-2022 to analyze changes in revenue, employment, and business entry and exit. We expect to find modest effects of the EZ program in the short run and larger impacts over the long term as the boost to local economies compounds for the next generation who experience additional effects through increased human capital accumulation."
