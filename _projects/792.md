abstract: "This project will increase the understanding of how local labor markets adjust to an influx of immigrants.  With quarterly data on the earnings and geographic location of workers from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, the proposed research will model the process of labor market adjustment by following individual workers over time.  This unique data will allow us to both model the short term effects that are missed by other studies using Census data as well as document the longer-term effects on workers affected by immigration in specific industries.  The study will carefully analyze the impact of skill complementarities between native and immigrant workers by occupation, within detailed industries, and at the firm level. 
The research proposes to link the Current Population Survey March Supplement to the LEHD using the PIK-CPS crosswalk.  In addition to the LEHD Employer Characteristic File (ECF), this project needs the LEHD Employment History Files (EHF), the LEHD Individual Characteristics File (ICF), the LEHD Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), the LEHD Geocoded Address List (GAL), and the LEHD Unit-to-Worker (U2W) Impute files.
This project will model the process of labor market adjustment to immigration, and in the process increase the Census Bureau's understanding of the quality of the data produced through the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program by comparing Unemployment Insurance (UI) earnings records in the LEHD Employment History Files (EHF) to the earnings reported for the same individuals in the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS).
