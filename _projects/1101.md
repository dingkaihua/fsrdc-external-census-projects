abstract: "This research investigates how statewide changes in debtor protection provided by U.S. personal bankruptcy law affect firm entry and exit dynamics. The project assesses the effects of personal bankruptcy law on entrepreneurship rates, the size and industry distribution of incumbent firms, and on business closures, as well as the extent to which firm entry and exit varies with bankruptcy exemption laws and local demographic and economic conditions.
