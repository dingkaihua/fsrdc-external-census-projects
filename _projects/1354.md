abstract: "This project studies the role of organizational capital using data from the newly available Management and Organization Practices Survey (MOPS). It examines the investment and distribution of organizational capital across firms and industries, how these investments interact with investments in physical capital, and ultimately how they are related to firm value and risk. The first set of questions is to understand how firms invest in organizational capital. How do managerial practices form and evolve over time in a firm? Do firms have similar practices in different units across industries and capital vintage? How does organizational capital interact with investments in physical capital? Do managerial practices and organizational structure influence financial decisions such as leverage and cash holdings? None of these questions have yet been thoroughly explored, and most of the existing evidence on managerial and organizational practices are anecdotal and difficult to compare across firms. The unique features of MOPS allow for addressing these questions. The second question is how organizational capital is related to firm risk. Part of the productive knowledge in the firm is accumulated in its employees, particularly managers and key talents. The organizational capital that is embedded in key employees (i.e., firm-specific human capital) is portable. The ultimate question is how organizational capital is related to firm value. Other research shows that good managerial practices correlate positively with firm productivity. However, identifying a causal effect of managerial practices on firm value can be very challenging. The problem will be addressed through two important corporate events â€“ takeovers/acquisitions and shareholder activism."
