abstract: "This research aims to understand the changing nature of new firms and their founders and some of the mechanisms that are at work behind firm birth, survival, and growth. We mostly utilize the 2012 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) and the annual waves of the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, but also plan to compare the firm and owner outcomes with the 2007 SBO and its predecessors. Our research questions include understanding why start-up rates and overall rates of entrepreneurship differ across geographic areas and with the owner characteristics (relative to area population). We also seek to understand why there are so many successful businesses founded by certain population groups, but not that many founded by others. Finally, utilizing the longitudinal nature of the data we evaluate whether there are differential changes in the rates of entrepreneurship across geographic areas and to what extent the changing area demographics, such as the aging of population or growing immigrant population, can account for that."
