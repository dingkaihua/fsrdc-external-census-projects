abstract: "The purpose of this research is to structurally model the dry cleaning industry in its evolution to green cleaning technologies and to perform reduced form analyses on the industry at a national level as made possible with the use of the Census data. Several states have implemented different incentive programs and fee structures designed to phase out the use of perchoroethylene (perc), and these different incentive programs and ultimate transition of the industry will have direct impact on the industry structure. The results from this analysis will yield profit estimates in the industry and create a sample selection methodology for specified Census data sets. "
