abstract: "The project will examine total costs incurred for research and development (by Federal and by company) from the RD-1 survey for the entire time period available (1972-latest year available). The expenditure data will be used for two purposes: (1) to improve the industry performed R&D capital stock and (2) to generate a government funded R&D capital stock. The stocks will be included as variables in an industry-level translog variable cost function estimation. The returns to total R&D investment and the returns to capital stock of government funded R&D will be estimated. "
