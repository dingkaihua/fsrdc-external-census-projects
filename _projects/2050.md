abstract: "The purpose of this project is to investigate whether and how a new model of "demographic inversion" applies to internal and international migrants across metropolitan areas in the United States. Scholars and journalists have given significant attention in recent years to the declining relevance of traditional urban demographic models, which propose an association with upward mobility and suburban residential attainment. Empirical evidence to support this claim, however, is often limited by the coarse geographic resolution of publicly-available demographic data. This project will analyze the evolving dynamics of residential mobility in US metropolitan areas at micro-geographic levels using confidential data from the American Community Survey."
