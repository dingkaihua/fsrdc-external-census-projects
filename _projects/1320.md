abstract: "This project investigates the role credit availability plays in the development and growth of small and young businesses in different geographical areas. This role will be moderated by the availability of credit for these ventures, whether it is for start-up capital or for expansion capital. By examining these issues for different geographic areas and by using different measures of geographic areas, this project will also establish the role geography can play in economic modeling."
