abstract: "This project examines whether the coverage of exports in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) systematically changes over the period of 1993-98. It does so by performing three tasks. First, it creates annual estimates of the total value of exports from the data collected in the ASM and compares these estimates over time to related statistics in the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT990) series. Second, it performs the same type of comparisons for industries in which it is believed that the quality of related FT990 estimates has declined over the period of the study. Third, it uses the ASM data to examine whether there are systematic differences in export-growth rates across different types of manufacturing establishments. Particular attention is paid to an assessment of whether the quality of the ASM data is such that it can reasonably be used to shed light on the quality of the estimates provided in the FT990 series."
