abstract: "We examine how using the reduced sample sizes of the 2007â€“2016 American Community Survey data at the tract level, relative to the 2000 decennial long-form sample, can affect estimates of demographic composition and socioeconomic conditions. We find that measures of income segregation are biased upwards by smaller samples at the tract level, and seek to apply corrections to those measures. In addition, we examine how Bayesian models can be applied to small area estimation for point estimates of tract characteristics and how estimates of tract characteristics can be harmonized over time to adjust for changes in tract boundaries.
