abstract: "This research will assess the impact of changes in male and female economic opportunity on marriage formation in the United States since 1960. The working hypothesis is that rising female opportunity discouraged marriage, but that eﬀect diminished over time; after 1970 the decline in the supply of young men with good jobs was the key factor behind late marriage. Previous eﬀ orts to address these questions were stymied by inadequate geographic precision in available public-use microdata and by insuﬃcient sample sizes, especially for racial minorities. The decennial long-form census microdata present an opportunity to deepen understanding of this extraordinary demographic transition."
