abstract: "The Spatial Sciences Census Research Node (SSCRN) will foster a connection between the spatial and the survey sciences. This bridge will yield both immediate and long‐term benefits for the estimation, dissemination, and usability of the small area statistics produced by the Census Bureau. Small area statistics describe the character of the population within small geographic zones, such as census tracts, and can be imprecise. Apart from the impractical solution of increasing the sample size, the only way to reduce the uncertainty of survey estimates is to utilize ancillary information about the population. Historically, very little attention has been paid to the geographic distribution of populations within these small areas. This research will increase knowledge about the organization of the population within small geographic areas, and exploit new forms of geographic information and recent advances in spatial statistics, to make small area estimates more accurate. This project will develop software tools that will enhance the usability of small area estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) by allowing users to intelligently combine tracts to reduce uncertainty in variables of interest. In addition to improving small area population estimates, an improved understanding of the geographic micro‐structure of the U.S. population is of broad scientific interest and may expand knowledge about socio‐spatial processes like segregation and neighborhood effects.
