Particular topics that we plan to address include the impacts of administered protection on U.S. workers, a better understanding of productivity measurement and productivity dynamics, new approaches to examining the role of exporting on firm performance, the determinants of the destination of U.S. firm exports and imports, and estimating the sunk costs of exporting and their effects on trade and industrial dynamics."
