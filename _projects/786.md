abstract: "The purpose of this research project is to improve understanding of the quality of Title 13, Chapter 5 data on employment and wages, and to prepare estimates of the dynamics of workplace wages and their relation to overall changes in the wage distribution, the economic return to Research and Development (R&D) (both private and social), and the role of science and engineering workers on innovation, knowledge transmission, and economic growth. The project compares employment and wages across the data files of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the economic census, and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Employer Characteristics File. Cross comparison of employment and wages from the three separate sources will establish whether reporting variance can be duplicated across sources, methods for the allocation of firm based R&D expenditure to establishments, and investigate recall bias for employment measures in the economic census. Recall bias will be quantified for economic census respondents that report March 12 employment that has a closer match to fourth quarter LEHD employment or first quarter employment for the following year, in comparison to first quarter LEHD employment for the March 12 period of the economic census year. Fourth quarter or first quarter of the following year employment is closer to the timing of when economic census survey forms are mailed out. The extent of recall bias will be related to firm characteristics, for example as captured by worker turnover statistics in the Quarterly Workforce Indicators. The project will produce population estimates of establishment and individual wage distributions and wage dynamics. The project will also produce population estimates of the effect of R&D activity on firm productivity. As a complement to the firm based analyses, the research will investigate wage distributions over time, coming from the perspective of the worker and using the Current Population Survey. The data will allow the follow­ing of workers from firm to firm and measure the R&D content of their working experience. Finally, the project will provide population estimates of the impact of unions, innovation, firm volatil­ity, and financial distress on employment and wages."
