abstract: "The proposed research introduces a new paradigm for the study of minority migration within metropolitan areas that goes beyond the “black-white, city-suburb” typology, which characterizes most of the detailed census migration analyses to date. This study takes cognizance of two developments. First, immigration and the recent foreign-born population have increased significantly over the past two decades, creating a broader mix of race and ethnic minorities. Their movement, both into and within the metropolitan area, requires a new understanding of race-based migration dynamics of the central city and within the suburbs.  This study develops such a paradigm, which explicitly recognizes new immigrant minorities and their migration components; as well as the heterogeneity of community types that have developed within the suburbs. Using a comparative metropolitan framework based on the 25 largest metropolitan areas, this research will show how race and ethnic immigrant/native migration processes vary across zones of suburban communities and central cities and how they are shaped by these areas’ and their metropolitan areas’ sociodemographic and structural features. This study will develop a new multicategory typology and operationalize it within the 25 largest core based metropolitan statistical areas to be identified in 2003 by the Office of Management and Budget. It will also employ this typology in an analysis of intrametropolitan migration processes for these metropolitan areas, toward assessing the analytic utility of the typology."
