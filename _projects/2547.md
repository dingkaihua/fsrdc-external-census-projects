abstract: "Among the leading explanations for Black income convergence in the 20th century U.S., the improved quality of southern schools and a suite of Civil Rights era employment protections are dominant. We assess the impact of each change, alone and in concert, by following Americans born between 1902 and 1932 through their work lives. Our earlier work indicates that poor school quality was the proximate cause of income inequality for this group at labor market entry in 1940. We merge school quality data from the segregated pre-1940 South with restricted access Census and Social Security earnings data to investigate the long-term legacy of separate and unequal schooling. We take advantage of cross-cohort and geographic variability in the quality of pre-War Black schools, along with teacher salary schedules and Rosenwald school-building campaigns that drove some of that variation quasi-experimentally, to uncover causal effects of school quality on the shape of long-term age-earnings profiles.

Since the "long term" for these cohorts overlapped with the Civil Rights era, we can additionally explore whether there were corrective effects of Civil Rights era legislation, in part by measuring whether the race-specific and race-by-gender-specific returns to school quality and experience changed after the mid-1960s. 

Specific requested data files include the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (1973 in full and 1979, 1981-1985 if and when available); the corresponding extract of the Social Security Administration's Summary Earnings Record (SSA-SER); the Census Numident File; and the 1940 Census of Population."
