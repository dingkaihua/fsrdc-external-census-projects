abstract: "This research estimates the long run impact of childhood age, education, and nutrition exposure on adulthood labor market and related outcomes. We measure childhood exposure based upon variation in program or institution availability within an individualâ€™s county of birth. In particular, we consider ages 0 to 5 exposure to the rollout of Food Stamps, Head Start, and their interaction, ages 1 to 17 exposure to college openings, as well as childhood age and exposure to other nutrition and education programs and institutions. County of birth is identified using the restricted-use versions of demographic surveys linked to the Numident File, which contains a place of birth variable. Surveys considered include the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. These surveys enable us to measure the effects of program and institution exposure on a wide array of outcomes including educational attainment, employment status, earnings as well as health, migration, adulthood program participation, and mortality. These estimates extend existing research that documents the short-run impacts of these programs and institutions by demonstrating the long-run impacts of these programs and institutions. Estimates of long-run impacts are necessary for understanding the full societal benefits of these large and costly programs and institutions."
