abstract: "International trade has changed enormously in the last couple of decades following the rise of global value chains. Understanding the links between importing upstream intermediate inputs and exporting more downstream output (with additional value-added) is crucial for studying how U.S. production processes adjust in response to global shocks, and how shocks to the U.S. can affect the global economy through supply-side channels. In this project, we aim to make progress by 1) substantially improving our understanding of how the rise of global value chains has impacted American manufacturing, 2) unpacking the latter's impact on each manufacturing industry, on American workers of different skill sets, and on local economies in distinct geographical region, and by 3) conducting model-based policy analysis, as well as simulations of U.S. and international "shocks" - such as the U.S.-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic, to assess the role of GVCs, and the effects of such shocks on GVCs themselves.
