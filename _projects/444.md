abstract: "This project aims to enhance the utility of Title 13, Chapter 5 data by (i) linking the LRD with a comprehensive dataset of US patents; (ii) identifying shortcomings of current data collection programs and documenting new data collection needs, specifically with regard to innovation; and (iii) preparing estimates of learning, ‘spillovers’ in learning, and the impact of technological advance on productivity not contained in existing publications.
This project will further the U.S. Census Bureau’s objectives regarding the collecting and analysis of information on productivity and technological innovation and address some of the associated issues. This project will link two extensively used datasets—the LRD and the NBER Patent Dataset, a comprehensive dataset of all U.S. patents granted between 1963 and 1999—and provide a much richer picture of technological innovation than what can be obtained using R&D expenditures alone, which is the only measure of technological innovation currently available at the Census Bureau. Specifically, the study will use the linked dataset to develop a number of descriptive statistics regarding patenting behavior along the lines of the NSF R&D survey and compare them with the aggregate statistics in the NSF R&D survey.
The productivity estimates obtained using output-based (i.e., patent-based) innovation variables are likely to be significantly different from that estimated using input-based measures such as R&D expenditure. By providing comparisons of these detailed productivity estimates with “plain-vanilla” estimates, the results of the study will highlight the need for improvements in the current R&D survey or the need for a new innovation survey.
This project will produce a number of estimates of characteristics of the population that are not contained in existing publications. These estimates will be developed with two objectives in view—(i) to assess the extent of potential bias in productivity estimates due to ignoring the impact of learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation; and (ii) to provide a better understanding of the sources of productivity growth by decomposing productivity growth into that caused by learning, spillovers in learning, and technological innovation.
Specifically, the project will develop regression estimates of “labor learning” and “capital learning” by industry. Second, the analytical results will provide, by industry where possible, estimates of “spillovers” in learning within firms and across different firms, including the variation in the magnitude of learning “spillovers” with geographical proximity and locational characteristics. Third, the study will provide estimates of productivity growth decomposed into components caused by technological innovation, by learning, and by the interaction of innovation and learning. Finally, the study will create estimates of productivity differences from learning between (a) “survivors” and “non-survivors” and (b) between new entrants and existing incumbents diversifying into new industries."
