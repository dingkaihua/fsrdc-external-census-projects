abstract: "Employee contributions to health plan premiums and less generous forms of health insurance have both increased in prevalence in recent years in the employer-sponsored health insurance market. Given these trends and the related impact to the financial well-being of individuals, this research project seeks to understand potential drivers of less generous forms of health coverage in employer-sponsored health insurance markets. The research objectives of the project are to investigate the effect of 1) labor market concentration and 2) rising health care costs on health plan benefits offered by employers using Census-provided data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance/Employer Component (MEPS-IC), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), and the Census of Manufacturers (CMF) for the years 2001-2023, as available. We hypothesize that both higher labor market concentration and higher health care costs lead to less generous health benefit offerings in the employer-sponsored health insurance market.

The key outcome variables for both sets of analyses will be health plan characteristics computed at the establishment level based on MEPS-IC data (e.g., average employee share of health plan premium). Labor market concentration will be measured at the county-industry-year level based on the LBD data. Local health care costs will be measured based on the average plan premium cost at the county-year level using the MEPS-IC data. 

We will estimate the effects of these independent variables on plan benefit characteristics through regression analysis of establishment level data, controlling for establishment and market level covariates, as well as county and industry-year fixed effects. Establishment level covariates will include measures available from MEPS-IC (e.g., total part-time employees) and productivity measures available for a subset of manufacturing firms from the ASM and CMF data. To account for any unobserved market specific time varying factors that may bias our population estimates, we will use the labor market concentration of neighboring counties and state level malpractice payment rates to instrument for labor market concentration and health care costs, respectively."
