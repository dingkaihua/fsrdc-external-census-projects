abstract: "This study, which will be a joint project of BEA's International Investment and Regional Economic Analysis Divisions, will compare the geographic distribution of foreign- and U.S.-owned establishments and attempt to explain the reasons for any differences that are observed.  Location patterns of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing establishments will be examined at the sub-state level by using county-level data available from the Economic Censuses and SSEL to create totals for foreign- and U.S.-owned establishments for BEA "Economic Areas" and "Component Economic Areas.""
