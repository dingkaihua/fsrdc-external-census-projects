abstract: "Despite the influence of agents and brokers on health insurance decision making, especially for small businesses, little is known about the relationship between the structure of the agent/broker market and access and affordability of insurance. Our research aims to fill this gap by investigating the role of agents and brokers in the health insurance decisions of small businesses, a sector that is particularly vulnerable to potential problems regarding health insurance financing. We will investigate whether the structure of the market for health insurance agents and brokers is associated with outcomes such as the likelihood of shopping for coverage, offering coverage, high deductible plans and health savings accounts. The data on the market for insurance agents and brokers will be based on the membership database of the National Association of Health Underwriters. We will merge this data with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component, a nationally representative sample of employers along with information on their health insurance offerings and characteristics of the policies offered, as well as other information at the employer level. All our analyses will control for relevant market-level demographic variables and state small group regulations."
