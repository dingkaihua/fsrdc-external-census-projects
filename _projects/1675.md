abstract: "This research examines whether financial factors can explain the allocation of employment and capital across firms, and how that allocation affects aggregate productivity growth. Recent research has shown that differences in the allocation of resources across firms can explain differences in aggregate productivity across countries. Comparatively little research has focused on changes in the allocation of resources within a country, over time, or on the forces that affect this re-allocation. This projects seeks to answer three main questions. First, what determines a firmâ€™s debt-to-asset ratio (leverage)? Second, what is the relationship between leverage and growth in the size of the firm? Third, what is the role of firm financial structure in aggregate productivity growth? "
