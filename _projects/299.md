abstract: "This research project proposes three major areas of study in order to better understand the intergenerational transmission of inequality. First, building on Mazumder’s previous work, the 1984 and 1990 Surveys of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to the Social Security Administration’s Summary Earnings Records (SER) and Detailed Earnings Records (DER) will be used to measure the intergenerational elasticity in earnings between fathers and their children. Second, a highly structured model of earnings dynamics will be estimated using pooled data from the 1984, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1996 SIPPs matched to both the SER and DER. Among other things, this will provide a definitive view of the degree to which the rise in inequality during the 1980s and 1990s reflected changes in the distribution of permanent income. Third, a rich array of measures of family background and neighborhood characteristics will be used to better understand the underlying process by which income is transmitted from parents to children. This analysis will make use of the internal SIPP and Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) files that contain the detailed geographic identifiers. There are four benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau that will be derived from this study: an analysis of the reliability of using short-term averages of SIPP earnings as a proxy for permanent earnings, a study of the quality of earnings data for an attrited sample such as the SPD, an analysis of the quality of self-employment income data in the SIPP, and an analysis of the biases from using a sample derived from a match based on social security numbers."
