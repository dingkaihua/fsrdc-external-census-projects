abstract: "Most capital in the United States is idle much of the time. By some measures, the average work week of capital in U.S. manufacturing is as low as 55 hours per 168-hour week. The level and variability of capital utilization has important implications for understanding both the level of production and its cyclical fluctuations. This proposal will investigate a number of issues relating to the Survey of Plant Capacity measures. It will aim to better understand the behavior of these measures in the panel of plants and in the aggregate. It will use this analysis to make recommendations on expanding and improving the published statistics deriving from the Survey of Plant Capacity. These statistics could increase the value of this survey at low incremental cost. This improved information about the utilization margin would be a substantial benefit for economists and decision makers. Capital utilization is an important margin for understanding fluctuations in output and productivity at the plant and aggregate level and in firmsâ€™ decisions about adding or subtracting from their stocks of factors of production. This research will examine how Survey of Plant Capacity measurements can contribute to studying these issues."
