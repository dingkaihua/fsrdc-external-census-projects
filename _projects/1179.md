abstract: "The world economy is becoming more integrated as different stages of a single production process are performed in multiple countries. Measuring this type of production fragmentation is essential to ensure accurate statistics about current U.S. economic activity and its future growth prospects. This project will combine multiple data sources to provide new measures of production fragmentation, with a particular emphasis on activities that U.S. firms choose to locate in foreign countries. These new measures will address: (1) how fragmentation differs across U.S. firms and geography; (2) the determinants of firms' decisions to fragment production; and (3) the domestic employment and R&D ramifications of firms' fragmentation decisions. To develop new data that measure firms’ global production choices, this project will use items collected in the 2007 Economic Census to identify individual establishments that report fragmenting and offshoring production. To assess firms’ globalization decisions over time, the research will improve the existing linkages currently in the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transaction Database by developing new methodologies to link the trade transactions data to the Longitudinal Business Database, as well as by linking the trade data directly to the economic censuses, the Company Organization Survey, and to the SDC Thomson merger and acquisition data. The new datasets developed under this project will expand the scope and range of the economic activity that can be studied at the plant and firm levels, leading to improved measures of the import, export, and offshoring activity in the U.S. economy.
