abstract: "This research employs recently developed methodology for estimating two-sided assignment models for producing forecasts or simulations about a range of labor market phenomena. For such models to generate accurate and useful forecasts, one needs to be able to observe the key characteristics that capture the heterogeneity on both sides of the market that leads certain agents on one side to be disproportionately likely to match with certain agents or units on the opposite side. LEHD data provide a very rich set of characteristics that describe agents or units on both sides of the market (workers and firms). This research will produce forecasts about (i) which workers in which locations would be most affected by alternative forms of local labor demand shocks (plant relocations, stimulus packages, natural disasters), (ii) the degree to which differential access to jobs with strong career paths, differential promotions, and differential frequency and quality of outside offers (conditional on job type) contribute to gender and racial income disparities at different points in the life cycle, (iii) how the earnings distributions by race and gender are likely to evolve in the next decade, given the differences in the racial, gender, and educational attainment composition of entering vs. exiting cohorts in the U.S labor market, and (iv) how assortative matching patterns along various dimensions might change as the occupational and industry composition of the labor demand changes, given the degree to which occupation and industry affect search costs in the marriage market.
