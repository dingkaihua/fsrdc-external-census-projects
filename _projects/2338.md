abstract: "Sociodemographic predictors of mortality rates for the US population have been estimated in prior research.  We know that these rates vary by age, sex, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and geography, among other factors (Cutler et al. 2006).  However, many questions have only been partially addressed because of data limitations.  For instance, causal effects of socioeconomic status on mortality remain unclear.  The association of many of these factors on death, by cause, is also limited because of the large sample size needs to assess relationships.  Therefore, we will ask several interrelated research questions to expand our knowledge of the sociodemographic predictors of US mortality. We will do this by utilizing the restricted version of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study. First, the analysis will examine trends in differences in old-age mortality outcomes based on state-of-birth.  Second, using the up-to-30 year follow of mortality outcomes, the project will examine risk of mortality by cause-of-death for broad groups of occupational categories.  Third, compulsory schooling laws that vary by state and year will be merged with state-of-birth and year-of-birth information in the NLMS in order to use an instrumental variables approach to estimate the causal effects of educational attainment on mortality outcomes.
