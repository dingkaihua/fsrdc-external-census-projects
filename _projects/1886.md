abstract: "This project will use the MEPS-IC to examine the impact of the 2006 Massachusetts health care law on employers, particularly small employers. The project will explore to what degree the new law increased employer sponsored coverage over what would have occurred in the absence of change, and the change in employer sponsored coverage due to a greater percentage of firms offering coverage, a greater share of employees signing up for coverage, or some combination of the two. The degree to which increases in premiums after change arise from provisions in the law versus the general trend in health care inflation observed across the nation will be performed, and if small employers experienced differences from larger employers. Analysis will uncover if small employers pass on the increase in premiums to their employees or the public sector, if firms increase employee contributions, if employees pay more in terms of cost-sharing (e.g. deductibles, copayments), and if a greater share of employees sign up for public health insurance coverage. 
By studying the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, this project will ascertain whether the MEPS-IC sampling frame is sufficient to evaluate whether the differential impacts of health care changes across states and firms of varying sizes are statistically significant. This question is important to MEPS-IC program planning because many of the recent changes in health insurance options are determined at the state level, information the MEPS-IC is designed to capture. This research will assess whether the MEPS-IC sampling frame is sufficiently robust for conducting analyses at a more granular state/firm size category than what is currently available in the summary tables. The researchers will accomplish this by analyzing changes in coverage and costs at the state level for firms of varying sizes, and benchmarking their results against a state-level survey of Massachusetts employers conducted in 2007 and 2008 by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/National Opinion Research Center (RWJF/NORC). 
Difference-in-difference estimates of the population of firms will be generated of the impact of the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, comparing trends before and after changes in coverage, employer premiums, employee contributions and cost-sharing for employers of various sizes for Massachusetts versus the United States and New England states."
