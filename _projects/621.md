abstract: "Wage inequality increased substantially in the United States during the past quarter century. The sources of this increase and its public policy implications have been controversial, both within academia and among policy makers. Much of the debate has surrounded whether this increase was due to technological factors, such as the diffusion of information technology, or to policy changes, such as reductions in the minimum wage (in real terms).  Economists have proposed that organizational structure affects wage inequality and can amplify the effect of technological factors, especially in contexts where production is human-capital intensive. Understanding what affects wage inequality in human-capital-intensive sectors is particularly important because these sectors occupy a high and growing share of U.S. economy and because many government policies aimed at raising wages at the low end do so by increasing these workers’ human capital. If wages are affected not just by individuals’ human capital, but the organizational structure in which individuals’ work, one can make these policies more productive by applying them in organizational contexts where they are likely to have the greatest impact on wages. This proposal examines the quality of the 2002 Census of Services data for legal services firms, compares their quality to that of previous census of Services, and produces estimates of number of lawyers that extend a series that the Census Bureau published for 20 years but failed to publish in 2002. The research also investigates how the organization of legal services—in particular, firms’ hierarchical structure—has changed over time, characterizes the distribution of wages in this industry and how it has changed over time, and analyzes relationships between changes in hierarchies and changes in the wage distribution. The latter will lead to a better understanding of wage inequality not only in legal services, but also in human-capital-intensive sectors (such as services) more broadly."
