abstract: "In the world of emergency medical services, understanding "payer mix" -- i.e., the percentage of patients that are uninsured, covered by public programs, or privately insured -- can help public health departments make informed decisions about how to allocate resources like ambulatory services. However, detailed estimates of the relevant population characteristics at sufficient levels of geographic granularity carry disclosure risks that threaten respondent confidentiality, when produced using standard methodological approaches. This project aims to produce a block group-level map of the payer mix by relevant sociodemographic groups for the State of Wyoming, in coordination with the State's Department of Health, from 10-year pooled American Community Survey data by using Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models. The resulting estimates will allow the State to proceed with data-informed health policy decisions while upholding disclosure protections and providing a roadmap for how Census might produce similar estimates from geographic areas with small populations in the future."
