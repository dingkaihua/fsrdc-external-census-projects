abstract: "In this project, we seek to explore how aggregate outcomes are affected by the composition of workers within firms. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the role of heterogeneity in worker types for a variety of macroeconomic outcomes. First, we investigate the role of worker composition for aggregate productivity growth. Second, we analyze the importance of worker composition in determining the success of startups and the spillovers from startups to other firms. Third, we estimate the degree of labor market power in the US economy and investigate the extent to which market power interacts with worker composition. The lack of a comprehensive source of micro-level data covering the majority, if not the whole, of the US economy has impeded a structural analysis on the above research questions. Therefore, we propose to use micro-level data from the Census Bureau to uncover new facts on firm- and worker-level outcomes and how these observations will aid us in understanding the sources of heterogeneity in US aggregate outcomes and how these have evolved over time."
