abstract: "How important are childhood environments in shaping civic engagement and voting behavior? Motivated by existing evidence that the neighborhood in which we grow up can have long-lasting effects on our economic and social outcomes, we will ask whether civic engagement - measured by whether an individual registers to vote and participates in elections - is also shaped by our childhood environment, above and beyond the influence of our family. In addition to measuring overall effects of childhood neighborhoods on adult political behavior, we will also investigate whether neighborhood's influence is larger at certain ages. Furthermore, we will measure heterogeneous effects by demographic characteristics and location to uncover the mechanisms by which childhood environments shape political behavior. To answer these questions, we aim to first combine nationwide voter file data with Census Bureau information on family linkages and address histories. We will then track households that relocate across areas to assess the extent to which young adults' probability of registering and voting depends on the amount of time they spent in the origin and destination neighborhoods. Because our project requires linking Census Bureau data to external administrative data on political participation, we will finally be able to analyze the accuracy of self-reported information on voter registration and turnout present in the CPS and to identify individual-level correlates of misreporting which could be used to improve future turnout estimates."
