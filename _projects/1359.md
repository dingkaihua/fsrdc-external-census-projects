abstract: "This project will investigate population characteristics surrounding food manufacturing establishments in the United States; comparing populations located around different establishments as well as populations over time surrounding the same food manufacturing establishment. The researcher will develop social vulnerability scores for populations at relatively small geographical levels. These scores will be used in multilevel analyses of the relationship between reported toxic emissions from food manufacturing establishments and the characteristics of the adjacent populations. Results from this project will be used in the completion of a doctoral dissertation as well as for academic articles prepared for publication and academic conference presentation. This project will benefit the census as authorized under Title 13, Chapter 5 using criterion 11 which refers to preparing population estimates as well as criterion 3 which refers to increasing the utility of Census Bureau Data. This research will greatly increase the utility of the American Community Survey, which is currently the best source of geographically specific, national-level information on the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of individuals and households. Furthermore, social vulnerability scores that will be developed for this project can be used to further understand and examine census hard to count populations."
