abstract: "For the past twenty years, Asian Americans have experienced the most rapid growth of any ethno-racial population in the United States. While numerous studies demonstrate higher educational attainment of Asian Americans relative to other racial groups, empirical evidence regarding whether Asian Americans are discriminated against in the labor market is scattered and mixed. Little research has analyzed labor market outcomes of Asian Americans from a longitudinal perspective or uncovered heterogeneity within this broad racial category. The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data 2000-2014 and Decennial Census data (2000 and 2010) enable us to examine earnings trajectories between Asian Americans and other groups (Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics) and across Asian American subgroups. Our proposed project consists of five research questions: (1) whether Asian workers are disadvantaged relative to White workers, (2) whether Asian workers possess an advantage relative to other minority groups (Blacks and Hispanics), (3) whether earnings trajectories of Asian workers vary by gender, (4) whether life-course earnings trajectories of Asian Americans vary by immigrant generation, nativity, and ethnic ancestry, and (5) whether Asian American (dis)advantage in earnings trajectories is associated with the racial compositions of an industry/workplace."
