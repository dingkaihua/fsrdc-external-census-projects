abstract: "This study will use confidential Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data to examine trends in residential settlement patterns in the United States since 1970.  Specifically, the research will compare the relative importance of socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity as predictors of observed settlement patterns for households that move into southern metropolitan areas during recent decades.  In the process of making these comparisons, the researchers will examine differential trends in locational attainment between races for inter-urban migrants, intra-urban migrants, and non-migrants in southern U.S. metropolitan areas.  Results will provide a test of how well certain models predict the observed settlement and distribution patterns of movers during the time period under study, and in the process will establish the basis for better understanding the predictive role of migration when studying the locational attainment of African Americans.
Locational attainment refers to neighborhood quality as measured by variables such as poverty, crime rates, housing values, pollution levels, unemployment, and school quality.  This study will determine if locational attainment differences exist between particular groups of inter-urban migrants, and if so, what factors underlie such differences.  Similar analyses will compare locational attainment for inter-urban migrants with that of  intra-urban and non-migrants, based on questions in the aforementioned Decennial Censuses and the ACS about having moved in the past year (ACS) or five years (Decennial).  The assimilation model predicts that SES is the only important predictor of the settlement and distribution patterns of movers.  Alternatively, other models posit that racial and ethnic distributions underlie these patterns.  This study will determine which model best describes the patterns observed in the microdata from 1970 to 2008 and beyond.  This time period is of particular importance to the researchers, whose interest lies in studying the trend in migration of African-Americans out of the South and into non-southern metropolitan areas in the decades preceding 1970, coupled with the more recent decadal trends reversing this process as Blacks return to the South and disproportionately settle in growing Southern metropolitan areas.  The researchers will combine data from questions on recent movement and location of birth to determine which individuals meet the specific migration criteria of interest."
