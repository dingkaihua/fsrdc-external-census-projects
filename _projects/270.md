abstract: "The US manufacturing sector as a whole has faced increasing international competition in the last generation, but competition was especially intense in textiles and apparel production. It is crucial, both for our understanding of economic forces as well as for decision-making, that the determinants of this evolution be disentangled. I propose to investigate the causes of this decline through empirical examination of production and trade in subsectors of the US textile and apparel industries. In the textile sector the production of broadwoven cotton cloth has stagnated over the last 20 years while the production sub-categories of broadwoven cotton has expanded. I will document the differences in historical performance, and then use plant-level data from the US Census of Manufactures to identify the relevant determinants of this divergence. The methodology used will be regression-based, with semi-parametric techniques used when appropriate. The result will be a decomposition of the observed evolution in employment, wages, productivity and investment in these industries into that attributable to import competition and that attributable to specific other causes. Access to the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), will provide consistent links between the plant-level data of the LRD and the data on international trade and finance found in public databases that will be useful in welfare analyses of trade and globalization. Specifically, links to data on binding quotas in these industries will be created. The project also will provide documentation of potentially useful additions to the Census questionnaire to address the question of unemployment due to trade-related dislocation, as specified in the Trade Adjustment Act and other legislation of the US Congress. Finally, the project will provide an example of the application of a profit-maximization based estimating structure upon the data for the manufacturing plants of the LRD."
