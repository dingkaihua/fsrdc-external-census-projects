abstract: "This research project uses timing of childbirth to measure the income effect of taxes on parents' labor supply. The IRS Residency Test states that families can claim a dependent for the entire fiscal year if the child was born at any time during the year, and therefore provides an exogenous source of variation in tax liabilities for births that occur late in the year versus those that occur early the following year. By measuring the difference in earnings in the subsequent year for parents of December and January births, we can identify the impact of a one-time non-labor income shock on parents' labor supply since both groups face on average the same future stream of tax rates after birth. Preliminary results using public-use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and cross-sectional data from the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that a temporary increase in after-tax income leads to a significant decrease in mothers' earnings with an estimated income effect of -0.9. This calls for a better understanding of the income effect of taxes of earnings, an important parameter that has not been studied carefully in previous work.  Restricted data from the 2000 Census Long Form and the ACS can alleviate the shortcomings of the current public-use datasets: coarse information on date of birth and small samples. This research will produce a new estimate of the income effect, an important characteristic of the US population that has been overlooked in previous work. The few previous studies that have incorporated measures of non-labor income in earnings elasticity estimations have all done so in the context of tax reform. This research project is the first one to look directly at changes in non-labor income's impact on earnings arising from taxes, resulting in a more transparent identification strategy and greater statistical power."
