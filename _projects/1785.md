abstract: "This research endeavors to estimate the causal impact of extreme weather on manufacturing productivity in the United States as part of a broader global analysis of the aggregate productivity impact of intensifying temperature extremes. We will use data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures, Census of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database from 1972â€“2014 to construct a plant-level panel of manufacturing productivity that will be merged with county-level weather data to empirically estimate the causal effect of extreme temperatures. We will combine these results with separate estimates using microdata on manufacturing and agricultural production from many countries around the world to quantify the global heterogeneous impact of extreme temperatures on national comparative advantage between manufacturing and agriculture. These empirical estimates will then be embedded in a model of global trade to understand how the endogenous reallocation of production between broad sectors of the economy could reduce the aggregate costs of the shifting distribution of global temperatures. The trade model will also be used to quantify the degree to which trade barriers impede this mechanism of adaptation."
