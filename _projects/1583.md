abstract: "The reengineering of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) yielded a variety of innovations in the data collection, including the introduction of the Event History Calendar (EHC) method, the collection of paradata/auxiliary data, and dependent interviewing. Using the SIPP‚ÄêEHC field tests, this research project involves two research objectives. First, the research project will delve into the respondent retrieval processes by parsing the audit trails generated during EHC. Second, the research project will make significant use of paradata/auxiliary data (e.g., audit trails, contact history, sampling frame information) in order to identify data quality indicators and imputation variables."
