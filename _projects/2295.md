abstract: "Congressional inquiries and Executive Order 13826 have called for improved access to data for research on job opportunities for individuals who interact with the criminal justice system. In order to study the interaction of labor markets and the criminal justice system systematically at the micro-level, researchers need detailed person-level longitudinal data on employment, earnings, and criminal justice interactions. Since sample surveys rarely have sufficient coverage to generate the necessary statistical power to study topics such as labor market outcomes by types of crimes or sanctions, employment prospects of ex-inmates in rural areas, or specific prison occupational programs, research requires the analysis of administrative records as described in this proposal. 
To address these needs, this project will integrate data for individuals on employment history and justice involvement to examine the effect of employment on offending at the individual -level. Specifically, this study will examine the relationships between labor demand shocks, kinship job loss, own job loss, conviction-based employment restrictions, and offending. Labor demand shocks lead to changes in own employment, which could impact offending resulting in employment restrictions for convicted offenders. It is then the employment restrictions that contribute to reoffending because of blocked opportunity to reenter the labor force. In addition, estimates of population characteristics will be produced for justice-involved individuals, a group that is notoriously difficult to reach.
To examine the framework described above, four Census Bureau provided data sets will be linked  with PI provided data. The four sources of Census Bureau data requested in this proposal include the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and the Census Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). CJARS is a new dataset built on administrative records that tracks arrests, charges, convictions, and participation in the correctional population in the United States. It currently holds over 57 million records from 17 million individuals in 14 states. Ongoing data collection will expand the size of this data in coming years. CJARS data will be linked with data from the LEHD program, ACS, and Decennial Census to produce individual-level information on employment, earnings, criminal history, and family structure. The PI supplied data will include publicly available LAUS data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and PI-collected legislative data."
