abstract: "The project will investigate economic growth at the establishment and firm level. The researchers will dissect the evolution of the establishment and firm size distribution across locations and sectors. The researchers will also analyze the establishment margin of firm growth--the role of new and exiting establishments--and characterize the joint size distribution of firms and establishments. Moreover, the researchers propose to study the geography of economic production. The researchers will identify agglomerations, those sectors and locations where establishments disproportionately locate near one another to gain from the economic spillovers. The researchers will then study the determinants and effects of agglomeration on firm growth and other economic conditions. Finally, the researchers plan to explore how firm and establishment growth rates are influenced by demand shocks, trade shocks, and by the decline in reallocation that took place in the United States in the last few decades.  Among other contributions, the project will extensively use data on all available sectors: not just data on manufacturing but also underutilized data on nonmanufacturing sectors which now dominate the U.S. economy."
