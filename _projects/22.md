abstract: "This project will examine changes in plant-level inventory behavior over the past three decades.  In particular, this work will quantitatively estimate the relationship between changes in plant inventory levels and investments in the construction and maintenance of public roads and highways over the past three decades.  This project will also examine and control for other influences on inventory behavior, including trends in the use of information technology, changes in inventory management practices, and product proliferation, and their interaction with this transportation investment."
