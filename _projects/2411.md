abstract: "This project studies the labor market consequences of variation in housing wealth by exploring a wide range of labor market outcomes including labor supply, wage dynamics, geographic mobility, commuting behaviors, and unemployment duration. We use the restricted version of the Survey of Income and Program Participation from 1996 to 2014 which is linked with geographic variables (MSA and county codes). These geographic codes make it possible to better measure the fluctuation of housing value at the local level. This project contributes to the literature in two ways. First, our results improve our understanding of the consequences of housing market fluctuation and the mechanisms behind these effects. Second, by using the geographically linked SIPP, this project is able to investigate the data quality of housing wealth variables in the survey data."
