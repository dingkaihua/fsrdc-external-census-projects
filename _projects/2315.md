abstract: "This study examines the extent of the use of apprenticeship programs and automation, including robots, in the manufacturing sector and explores the impact of these programs and technologies on firm productivity, employment and local economies.  The specific research questions are: (1) which types of manufacturing establishments use apprenticeship programs, and how do these programs affect establishment productivity, innovation, employment and wages, and how does use of these programs affect regional business dynamism; (2) which types of manufacturing establishments use automation, and how does automation affect establishment productivity, innovation, employment and wages, and how does use of automation affect regional business dynamism; and (3) which types of manufacturing establishments use robots, and how does the use of robots affect establishment productivity, innovation, employment and wages, and how does use of robots affect regional business dynamism. 

The project proposes to use data from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the Census of Manufactures (CMF) along with several types of external user-provided data sets to understand how recent labor market programs and new types of capital are affecting manufacturing establishments in the U.S. In particular, we focus on the use of apprenticeship programs, which are viewed as a potentially useful approach to address declining labor force participation and skills shortages, and the use of robots and other types of automation."
