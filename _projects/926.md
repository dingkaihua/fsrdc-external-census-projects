abstract: "This project aims to contribute to an understanding of recent changes in the composition of food manufacturing industries, fluid milk manufacturing in particular. This research proposes two tests of a new method for estimating price/cost ratios: The first compares it to demand-based methods, and the second considers the importance of observing gross output quantities rather than just revenues. The new method provides a robust method for estimating markups, which may serve the Census Bureau as a broad measure of industry performance."
