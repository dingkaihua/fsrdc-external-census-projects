abstract: "The proposed research aims at testing whether and how the major components of neighborhood physical form—density, mixture in land use and housing, interconnectedness of street network—impose any systematic influence on residents’ perception and rating of their residential environment as a place to live, and how such influence would vary across household subgroups. It will employ multivariate statistic method to perform cross-sectional analyses. It will make use of the individual-level information from the publicly available 2002 metro-version American Housing Survey (AHS) data and neighborhood and community level social and physical measures derived from multiple data sources including the 2000 decennial census, the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP), and local parcel-based land use Geographic Information System (GIS) data. However, linking the AHS data to other datasets proposed to use in this research requires the census tract identifier, which is only available in the internal version of the AHS data. Given the current availability of the internal AHS datasets at the Center for Economic Studies (CES), the project proposes using the tract identifiers from the 1994/1995 internal AHS datasets for the 13 MSAs surveyed in the 2002 metro-AHS for the purpose of merging files. 
Funded in part by a dissertation research grant award by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the proposed research is anticipated to generate output that will not only inform policy makers but also benefit the U.S. Census Bureau in several areas. First, the proposed research will improve the understanding of the AHS data quality by conducting not only a careful examination of the AHS data itself but also an evaluation of the relationship between the AHS neighborhood measures and the neighborhood measures generated with other datasets. Second, analyses performed in this research will lead to potential improvement in data collection by identifying shortcomings in current AHS data collection and document new data collection needs, such as neighborhood attributes important to residential satisfaction but not currently surveyed in the AHS. Third, the resulting new dataset from merging the AHS with the neighborhood and community measures generated in this research will remain at the CES and be made available to other researchers. This new dataset will greatly enhance the utility of the AHS data in social science. And, fourth, the proposed research will yield summary statistics and coefficient estimates that go beyond those commonly released by the Census Bureau and enable a better understanding about Americans’ residential settings and residential experience."
