abstract: "How do inequalities between firms contribute to the racial earnings gap? Recent scholarship has discovered a growing gap between high-paying and low-paying employers; a second literature finds that firms have become more racially homogenous in the twenty-first century. If these two trends align, such that high-paying firms are those dominated by white workers, then they will exacerbate overall racial earnings inequality. We propose to use linked employer-employee data to investigate this risk. Combining contemporary data with historical records, we can measure both racial firm segregation over the last half-century, and the pay premiums associated with different employers. Together, these allow us to chart the role of between-firm segregation in racial pay inequality since the late 1960s. We will extend this analysis by examining the types of workplaces that pay more or less, and where nonwhite workers are over- or under-represented. Together, this study will combine a thorough analysis of the determinants of between-employer inequality with a description of long-term trends in the racial pay gap - connecting the impact of workplace fissuring and other transformations in employment to the persistence of racial economic inequality."
