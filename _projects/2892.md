abstract: "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest safety-net program that targets food insecurity in the United States, reduces food insecurity and poverty and improves health outcomes among participants. The importance of SNAP is highlighted by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) which was enacted at the onset of the COVID-19. This project uses the 2014-2021 North Carolina and South Carolina data to analyze the relationship between stable SNAP participation and population-level factors (food deserts, rural/urban residence, residential segregation). We will determine: 1) trends in SNAP participation patterns (2014-2021); 2) the relationship between population-level factors and measures of stable SNAP participation before the COVID-19 pandemic; 3) the association between population-level factors and stable SNAP participation during the pandemic. For each aim, we will also determine any difference between White and Black clients. Stable SNAP participation will be measured over a 12-month period and will include: 1) number of months on SNAP; 2) churning-exit and re-entry into SNAP within four months (yes, no) and 3) participation pattern (continuous vs discontinued/intermittent)."
