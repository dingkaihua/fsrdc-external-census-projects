abstract: "This research examines the effects of state mandatory kindergarten requirements on long-run educational attainment and labor market outcomes. While in most states kindergarten began as a voluntary program, starting in the 1970s some states evolved to mandating kindergarten attendance. Several changes in state mandatory school entrance laws across—and in some instances, within—states over time provide an opportunity to causally identify the influence of an additional year of early-childhood education on important individual education and labor market outcomes, comparing states with mandatory attendance to those with voluntary attendance. Using a natural experiment design, we exploit variation in kindergarten requirements between 1970 and 2000 using pooled repeated cross-sections for individuals born between 1965 and 1995 observed in the 2000 Decennial Census and the 2001–2016 American Community Survey. We compare population-level outcomes for birth cohorts observed in the surveys over time. Our results will shed light on the anticipated impact of universal prekindergarten programs given the national trend towards preschool for all."
