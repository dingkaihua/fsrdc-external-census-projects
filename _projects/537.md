abstract: "This project has four related components.  The first component continues research begun under our previous project at the Berkeley Research Data Center. At the heart of that project was the development of a general equilibrium model of an urban housing market, using an extensive dataset built around restricted-access decennial census data for 1990. In developing this framework further, we will focus on two areas—the identification of key parameters of the model using a boundary fixed effects approach and carrying out informative counterfactual simulations using the equilibrium model in conjunction with our parameter estimates.  The second component uses two waves of decennial census data, for 1990 and 2000, to study the effects of California’s Class Size Reduction Act on local housing markets. Our goal is to measure the size of the induced effects of the reform on household sorting across schools and neighborhoods before estimating the effects of such changes on school and student performance. The third component will make use of the rich cross-sectional data for 2000 to develop and estimate a matching model that describes how workers are matched to firms in equilibrium. And the fourth component will take advantage of the two waves of decennial census data for California (used in the second component of our proposed research) to estimate a dynamic housing market model."
