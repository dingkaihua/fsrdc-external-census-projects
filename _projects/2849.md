abstract: "This project will produce consistent estimates of intragenerational, intergenerational, and multigenerational mobility between 1850 and today. We will combine data from the 1850 to 1940 United States Decennial Censuses with post-1940 data from the Decennial Census, the Current Population Survey-Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC), and the American Community Survey. Our estimates will improve upon the existing literature by including women and non-white individuals across the entire period. Studies do not include women and non-white individuals in pre-1940 data due to data limitations, but we can overcome these limitations with a new dataset based on genealogical data that allows us to link across historical censuses. We also contribute to the literature by producing estimates that account for measurement error when measuring social status, error that may vary across data sources. In addition to estimates of social mobility for the overall population, we will estimate how mobility varies by nativity status, which will contribute to understanding how economic assimilation has changed across immigration cohorts in the 19th Century, early 20th Century, and today. Overall, our project will allow us to measure how "equality of opportunity" has changed across race, ethnicity, and gender over three centuries."
