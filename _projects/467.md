abstract: "This research will seek to apply the insights of the literature on idiosyncratic shocks to individual labor productivity to the dynamics of plant-level total factor productivity.  Using the methodology of Olley and Pakes (1995) and Levinsohn and Petrin (1999), this research will estimate plant-level productivity over time and across many manufacturing industries.  The research will then go on to characterize the time series properties of plant-level idiosyncratic shocks to productivity, taking into account industry-level and economy-wide shocks."
