abstract: "This research will use the U.S. Census Bureau's Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data to examine residential location decisions and the extent to which choice set constraints driven by market size affect the ability of households to choose their preferred bundle of household and neighborhood characteristics when choosing where to live. The analysis will be conducted by jointly estimating a structural model of residential choice decisions across several housing markets of varying sizes, yielding households' preferences for particular residential characteristics (e.g., characteristics of the house, neighborhood, and local public goods) that comprise the residential bundle.  Restricting analysis to markets for which residential preferences are similar conditional on household type, the analysis then characterizes the welfare costs of choice set constraints by calculating households' implied willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the predicted residential choices that could instead be obtained in a market of a different size. Additional counterfactual simulations will consider how the consumption of particular amenities would change in a market if bundling frictions are relaxed by de-linking the consumption of some amenities from the choice of residence."
