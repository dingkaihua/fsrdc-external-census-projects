abstract: "This project exploits the exogenous variation in market access brought about by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and investigates the effect of cross-country integration on local economic scale in the U.S.-Canada border areas and its subsequent impact on entrepreneurial business formation, innovation, and firm births. The analysis then compares the effects of the U.S.-Canada FTA with other preferential trade agreements (PTAs) signed by the U.S. such as with Australia, Chile, Jordan, Mexico, and Singapore. The researchers use the Longitudinal Business Database, Economic Census, Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD) to analyze the role of local market characteristics in promoting successful entrepreneurship and innovation. The analysis links trade transactions in the LFTTD and establishments in the Census of Manufacturers and Commodity Flow Survey to construct consistent yearly estimates of U.S. exports to compare data quality across the data sources at the plant level."
