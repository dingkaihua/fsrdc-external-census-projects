abstract: "This project seeks to recover all of the short form and long form microdata from the 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and convert them to a unified modern computer environment.  When the project is completed, these data will be available within the Census Bureau and to qualified researchers.  In collaboration with the Center for Economic Studies (CES), we seek to make these files available within the Census Bureau for research purposes and for special tabulations.  To facilitate data extraction and to make time-series analysis easier, we plan to harmonize the data.  We also hope to develop an interface that will allow special tabulations and data extraction to be automated.  "
