abstract: "This study examines how access to early childhood education affects a mother's joint decisions about family formation, education, mobility, labor supply and career trajectory for up to 25 years. As both employment and childrearing require substantial time and resource commitments, women facing these decisions likely face trade-offs. Gaining access to public school for children could relax mothers' time constraints, potentially affecting work decisions, the ability to move in response to labor market conditions, and the feasibility and timing of additional children. This study combines information on a child's eligibility for public early childhood education with restricted microdata from the 2000 Decennial Census, 2010 Decennial Census, American Community Survey and LEHD. We use a regression discontinuity design based on child's birthday relative to a school cutoff date to determine how just barely gaining access to early child education one year earlier affects mothers' decisions in the short-, medium-, and long-run from 2000-2025. This project provides new insight into the persistence of family-level effects of early childhood education provision as we evaluate many family outcomes, explore a long time horizon, and study mediating pathways in children's outcomes."
