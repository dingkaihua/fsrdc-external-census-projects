abstract: "Despite recent upticks in 'deaths of despair,' Non-Hispanic White mortality rates have
remained lower than those of non-Hispanic Black and American Indian or Alaska Native.
Because structural racism funnels marginalized groups into jobs lacking health-promoting
workplace benefits, work amenities and conditions are likely to substantially contribute to racial/
ethnic disparities in health. The proposed study will use data from the Longitudinal Employer-
Household Dynamics (LEHD), Census Numident, Mortality Disparities in American
Communities (MDAC), Decennial Censuses, American Community Survey (ACS), Current
Population Surveys (CPS), Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS-IC), and O*NET to
examine how cumulative exposure to four sets of workplace context measures (job
amenities and hazards, workplace racial/ethnic composition, workplace area racial
segregation, and employment trajectories) contribute to racial/ethnic health and mortality
disparities."
