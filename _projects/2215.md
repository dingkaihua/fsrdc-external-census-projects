abstract: "The economic and social consequences of violent victimization for individuals are not well understood. As a major and deleterious life event often effecting one's mental, physical and emotional well-being, it is likely that victimization either directly (i.e. through missed work due to health complications) or indirectly (i.e. resulting from psychological trauma that negatively impacts living conditions) disrupts economic stability. We propose to exploit the panel nature of the NCVS data to create victimization histories for respondents over a 3 year window, which we can then use to assess how changes in employment, earnings, housing, and marital status are related to instances of criminal victimization, after adjusting for demographic and economic characteristics of their communities. Results will shed light on the previously-ignored socioeconomic burden of victimization for individuals, as well as for which types of people these negative impacts are felt the strongest. "
