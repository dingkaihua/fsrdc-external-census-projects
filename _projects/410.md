abstract: "The Help Supply Industry (SIC 7363) has been one of the fastest growing industries in the U.S. economy. It includes both Temporary Help Services (THS) establishments, which supply workers to client firms on a temporary basis, and Employee Leasing Services (ELS) establishments, which supply workers to client firms on a longer-term basis. Research on the industry has been growing because of the important role it is thought to have had in increasing labor market flexibility by efficiently matching workers and employers (e.g., Segal and Sullivan, 1995, 1997; Golden, 1996; Ono and Zelenev, 2003). However, the rapid growth of the Help Supply Industry also presents challenges for statistical agencies and the researchers who use their data. One concern is that while the workers supplied by THS and ELS establishments are under the direct supervision of the client firm, they are on the payroll of the Help Supply establishments. Thus, they are not counted in the employment totals of the industries in which they perform their work. This can make standard estimates of labor productivity misleading for industries that utilize help supply workers. In addition, most research interest is in the role of THS firms in improving the functioning of labor markets, but most available data do not distinguish between THS and ELS employment. This is a concern because ELS firms, which typically take on the payroll of an existing workforce and have little role in the recruitment of workers, are unlikely to play the same important labor market intermediation role as THS firms. This project will increase the U.S. Census Bureau’s knowledge base about the relevant issues surrounding the Help Supply Industry. Given recent growth in this industry and its likely impact on the productivity and investment decisions of firms outside the industry (the client firms), this information is extremely important for evaluating Census Bureau’s collection and tabulation of employment data. To examine these issues, this project will extend our previous work (Ono and Zelenev, 2003; Segal and Sullivan, 1995, 1997) with micro-level analyses of firms’ use of temporary labor and the industrial organization of the THS industry. First, by using the 1997 and 2002 Business Expenditure Survey (BES) and Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (PCU), we will analyze the extent to which THS usage buffers fluctuations in client firms’ regular employment. We will also examine whether the use of THS is increased by greater competition among THS agencies. Next, by using the Census of Services and Longitudinal Business Database, we will study whether THS agencies are attracted to local markets with more volatile industrial structures, using the method employed in Ono and Zelenev (2003). We then will examine whether the entry of THS agencies reduces the markup they charge client firms for supplying workers. Finally, we will study the role of temporary help services in the particularly important market for temporary nurses. This proposal will further benefit Census programs by using Census micro data to address data quality issues and to create documentation that will benefit the Census Bureau by increasing understanding of current problems in the data as well as by improving future data collection efforts. In particular, we will contribute to the development of methods to improve the separate estimation of the number of ELS and THS workers employed by each industry in each geographic area. This will require use of the economic census and the BES. We will also develop methods to incorporate the inputs of THS and ELS workers in estimates of industry level labor productivity in manufacturing. This will require use of the PCU, as well as other census datasets."
