abstract: "The project is a comprehensive new study of worker adaptation to changing labor market conditions, following a nationally representative sample of several million workers who have lost jobs due to involuntary layoffs. We will utilize rich confidential U.S. Census Bureau micro
data from multiple sources - administrative records, censuses and surveys - that will enable us to follow the subsequent economic and geographic mobility of these workers over extended time periods. Using these data, we will provide a portrait of worker adaptation to the ongoing significant changes in demand for labor across numerous dimensions, such as worker history including industry and earnings; and worker and household characteristics including age, education, homeownership, and race. Our primary contribution will be a focus on geography, specifically how place shapes outcomes for individual workers. Observing the multidimensional patterns of worker adjustment, including mobility outcomes and transition to joblessness, will be highly relevant for understanding worker adjustment to mass layoffs and changing economic circumstances. We will follow individual displaced workers over time as well as across states, link their decisions to individual and local characteristics, and include a wide set of metropolitan-level characteristicsthat could shape worker outcomes, including housing costs, employment growth by industry, and other measures of labor market conditions. We will further work towards estimating a set of causal models examining worker mobility choices and long run earnings outcomes to increase our understanding of how involuntarily laid-off workers adapt in a variety of settings characterized by location and industry."
