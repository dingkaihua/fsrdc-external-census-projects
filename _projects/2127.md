abstract: "This project will analyze the employment diversity and establishment/firm productivity. It will produce some descriptive statistics and regression estimates of population diversity within firms and the effects on productivity that are not contained in existing publications. Employment diversity is one of the important aspects of the corporate culture. In recent years, the importance of the corporate culture for firms' performance attract more and more attention. The effects of employment diversity have not been fully investigated. There are different kinds of employment diversity such as ethnic diversity, age diversity, education diversity, and gender diversity. How do these different aspects of diversity affect firms' productivity? Do some of these diversities have positive effects while others have negative effects on firms' productivity?  The LEHD data are particularly well-suited to explore these questions. 
In this project the researcher will use the LEHD Individual Characteristics File to construct firm/establishment level age, gender, educational and ethnic diversity measures. The researcher will link these measures to firm (and when possible, establishment) records in the Economic Census, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Annual Retail Trade Survey and Annual Wholesale Trade Survey. Then the researcher will use these files to generate firm/establishment productivity measures. After generating the diversity and productivity measures, the project will show the descriptive statistics of all measures. Moreover, the study will develop regression estimates of the effects of firm/establishment level diversities on firm/establishment level productivity. "
