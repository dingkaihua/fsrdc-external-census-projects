abstract: "The project constructs longitudinal datasets from decennial censuses, surveys, and administrative data to study the long-term effects on the US population of three large-scale disasters that occurred since 2000. We investigate three cases: (1) Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans; (2) the US home foreclosure crisis; and (3) the COVID-19 epidemic. The first case studies Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina caused an unprecedented displacement of the population of an entire U.S. city when residents of Orleans Parish, Louisiana (the City of New Orleans) were forced to evacuate in August 2005. To study the long-term outcomes of the disaster-affected population using a quasi-experimental design, we link representative data on pre-Katrina individuals from New Orleans to information on their mortality and subsequent residential locations as well as other social and economic outcomes in the years following the disaster. The nationwide studies of the home foreclosure crisis and the COVID-19 epidemic also employ a quasi-experimental design. These two cases affected the entire U.S. population with spatial variation in the timing and intensity of their effects. Using spatial indices of exposure to the home foreclosures and COVID-19, we will measure variation across regions and between demographic groups on mortality, residential mobility, and other social and economic outcomes. In addition, to the individual level datasets we will also construct a county-to-county and tract-to-tract migration flows dataset in which flows are disaggregated by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and nativity groups. The dataset will be constructed from the annual Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File to be comparable to the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income population migration data."
