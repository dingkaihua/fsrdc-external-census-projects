abstract: " 
The primary purpose of this study is to enable the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand the role of venture capital (VC) financing in young firms and to improve the data collected in the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) and the Survey of Business Owners (SBO) by linking these datasets to an external dataset on VC financing. The researchers will suggest ways to improve the collection of information on VC financing and note any inconsistencies in variables across the Census Bureau datasets and the external data. The researchers will be the first to link the external dataset on VC financing (called VentureXpert) with the QFR and the SBO. The researchers will therefore create a bridge file that can be accessed by future users of these data. Finally, the researchers intend to empirically investigate important economic questions relating to VC. 
Using the SSEL Name and Address files from 1975 to 1999, the researchers will link VentureXpert to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) using a STATA coded name matching algorithm. The researchers will link the QFR (1982, 1987, 1992, 1997), and the 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners Survey (Firms and Owners) to the merged LBD-VentureXpert dataset using EINs and CFNs. The researchers will also link to the merged LBD-VentureXpert dataset the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Census of Manufactures, Census of Services, Census of Retail Trade, Census of Wholesale Trade, and Census of Construction Industries, and the 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Census of Transportation using EINs and CFNs. 
Using these data and additional data from SDC Platinum, CompustatÂ®, CRSP, the FDIC Summary of Deposits and Call Reports, and BEA economic data, the researchers will estimate what are the determinants of receiving VC financing and what is the relationship between VC financing and a variety of firm outcomes, such as growth rates, survival rates, time to merger, and time to initial public offering. Additional analysis will be performed on the sub-sample of the LBD and VentureXpert, which can be matched to and the Annual Surveys of Manufactures (1975 to 2001). This project will improve the data collected in the QFR and the SBO, creating a VentureXpert-SSEL bridge file, and creating estimates of the fraction of firms receiving VC financing from 1975 to 1999 and the determinants and impact of this VC financing."
