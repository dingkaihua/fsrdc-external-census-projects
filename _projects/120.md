abstract: "The research proposed here pertains only to the first phase of HUBZone analysis.  The second phase will be the subject of a future CES proposal. This proposal itself encompasses two distinct steps: the first is eligibility analysis, involving an effort to estimate the number of firms that might qualify for the HUBZones Program in different geographic areas; the second is an econometric analysis focusing on the dynamics of business survival and net job creation.
