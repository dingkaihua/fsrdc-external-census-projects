abstract: "This project will compute novel statistics useful in the analysis of older workers’ mobility and retirement decisions using individual data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with indices created from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure microdata. It will create refined employment opportunity indices based on detailed characteristics of the potential retirees. Currently available statistics, such as the LEHD’s Quarterly Workforce Indicators, provide detailed statistics by simple characteristics of the workforce, such as gender and age. This project will include additional characteristics in the computation of the employment opportunity indices. These include the respondents’ previous industry specific employment experience, the retirement decisions of similarly experienced individuals, and the mobility decisions of similar individuals. There would be three new types of indices: (1) a “job matrix,” which captures the geographic mobility patterns in employment; (2) a “mobility matrix,” which captures residential geographic mobility; and (3) an “opportunity index,” which is a person-specific convolution of these two matrices. The observed job mobility patterns of LEHD individuals, and in particular of older workers, will be used to estimate industry mobility patterns of recently hired workers at a detailed geographic level of work locations, the job matrix. The critical research issue is to determine the level of integration at which the new indices will be combined with existing data to produce a model estimation and forecasting framework. The observed geographic mobility of both LEHD and HRS individuals will be used to compute migration patterns of older workers and recent retirees to new residence locations, the mobility matrix. The mobility matrix (conditional on the HRS individual’s residence at any point in time) can be used to weight the job matrix (conditional on the HRS individual’s current or previous job characteristics), thus obtaining a person-specific job opportunity index, which is then incorporated into the relevant model. The utility of the proposed new indices, at the detailed and the aggregate level, will be assessed in a model-based framework. Using detailed demographic and geographic attributes of individuals, available on the HRS data with geographic supplement, models of the joint determina­tion of geographic mobility, and retirement will be estimated and tested for independence of these two decisions."
