abstract: "Establishment data from 1972-1997 Censuses of Manufacturers/ Annual Surveys of Manufacturers merged with worker information from 1970-90 Censuses of Population and 1995-99 March Current Population Surveys will be used to test whether manufacturing locates in high immigration areas, as trade theory predicts.  A cross-city regression of a labor/capital ratio-weighted sum of net capital investments per capita on immigrant inflows per capita measures new manufacturing employment created per immigrant arrival. Knowing how responsive manufacturing is to labor flows informs the debate over whether immigration lowers wages, and enhances understanding of manufacturing establishments locational decisions."
