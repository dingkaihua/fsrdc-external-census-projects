abstract: "Data collected by the Census Bureau's Survey of Plant Capacity form the basis of capacity utilization statistics published in the Federal Reserve's G17 Statistical Release. Despite important changes in the survey's sample design and questionnaire in the 1990s, there has been little assessment of the effects of these changes on data quality, nor has there been any analysis of questions added to the survey on plants' work patterns. The main purposes of this project will be to (a) investigate the quality of the survey data, (b) develop additional descriptive analyses of plant utilization and work patterns, especially using the new unpublished data, and (c) use the data to characterize relationships between capacity utilization, capital utilization (the "workweek of capital"), and capital investment in U.S. manufacturing plants.
