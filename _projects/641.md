abstract: "A recent development in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is the introduction of consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs). These plans, which include health reimburse­ment arrangements (HRAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs), place more financial responsibil­ity for health care decisions in the hands of the consumer with the goal of controlling health care costs. This project studies ESI offers of insurance, including offers of CDHPs and other types of plans, the number of plans offered, cost sharing decisions, and how CDHPs affect the overall mix of plans offered. This study uses the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPS-IC), which provides details on health insurance plans offered by employers. Data are also collected on characteristics of the establishment and its workforce. To capture local market characteristics, the MEPS-IC data will be merged with external data sources including the Current Population Survey, Survey of Income and Program Participation, and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey- Household Component. This project will provide various benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau. The quality of the data will be better understood fol­lowing comparisons between estimates using the MEPS-IC and other sources of information on ESI, including the Kaiser/Health Research and Educational Trust Employer Health Benefits Survey and the Robert Wood Johnson Employer Health Insurance Survey. This study will also examine the quality of a longitudinal database created using the MEPS-IC, while also creating a supplemental longitudinal dataset using synthetic panel methodology. This project will create two new measures for the MEPS-IC: (1) a predicted premium for non-offering establishments, and (2) a quantity-adjusted premium for each health insurance plan type (e.g., health maintenance organization or any provider plan). Finally, this research will produce a number of new estimates using these newly created measures and merged data, including estimates of ESI offers using the predicted premium information, CDHP offers, number of plans offered, and cost sharing."
