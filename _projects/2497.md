abstract: "Construction subcontractors experience high rates of injury relative to other employers, but the worker, establishment, and sector-level characteristics that increase injury risk are not well understood. By combining information from the Census' Census of Construction Industries with data on workplace injuries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Survey of Occupational Illnesses and Injuries, we will assess how contractor characteristics like the pace of work, industry attachment, and financial investment in equipment help explain the number and severity of injuries experienced on the job. This is the first time that these data will be linked across agencies, opening up many new avenues for research. Our findings will provide new insights into the causes of injuries in the construction industry that complement the efforts of other organizations, like the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, who are actively involved in promoting job site safety."
