abstract: "This project will quantify the impact of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) on labor market outcomes of persons under its purview compared to their experience prior to VRA and to those that are not affected. Using the Current Population Survey and Decennial Census, the researchers compare the outcomes of individuals that live in counties subject to Section 5 of the VRA to those not in these counties but in similar, geographically adjacent jurisdictions. This research will provide estimates of the economic effect of legislation designed to facilitate political participation on racial and ethnic minorities (the intended beneficiaries of these laws) as well as other affected subpopulations.
