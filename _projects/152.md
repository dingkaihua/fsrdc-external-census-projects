abstract: "This project examines how benefits received by minorities and non-minorities differ under the current Social Security system, and how benefits might differ under a reformed Social Security system based on individual retirement accounts.  To accomplish our work, we will analyze measures of Social Security's moneysworth separately for minorities and non-minorities.  More specifically, we will calculate rates of return to Social Security, benefits received net of taxes paid into the system, and benefit/tax ratios, including both primary and auxiliary benefits in our analysis.  This information will provide a more thorough understanding of the Social Security's "moneysworth" for both minorities and non-minorities and will allow us to assess the impact on both groups of some proposed changes to the Social Security system.
