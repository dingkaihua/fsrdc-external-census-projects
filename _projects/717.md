abstract: "This project will study the local labor markets dynamics related to two understudied segments of the U.S. population which likely differ from the rest of the population, particularly in recent years. These two subpopulations are reservists and the civilian spouses of military service members. The project will analyze the effects on reservists of leaving the civilian labor market temporarily; the cumulative effects of reservist activations on local labor markets and firms that employ reservists; and the effects of deployments on the labor market experiences of civilian spouses of military service members.
