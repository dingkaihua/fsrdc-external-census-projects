abstract: "This project will examine how multi-unit firms' life-cycle stages influence analysts' forecasts. Whereas prior studies focus on the firm-level life cycle, the proposed study will be the first study to focus on the establishment-level life cycle. Specifically, we will investigate whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower for multi-unit firms whose units are in different life-cycle stages than those whose units are in the same life-cycle stage. The expected findings will suggest that the forecasting difficulty of more diversified firms can be attributed to the different life-cycle stages of each establishment. Additionally, for firms whose units are in the same stage, we will examine whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower if all the units are in earlier stages than if all the units are in later stages. Also, for firms whose units are in different stages, we will examine whether analysts' forecast accuracy is lower if the units in earlier stages are larger (i.e., generates more revenue) than the units in later stages. To estimate the establishment-level life-cycle stages, we will use the Census data (CMF) at the establishment level. As a comparison, we will also estimate the life-cycle stages using firms' segment classifications in their 10-K filings. For the additional analyses, we will investigate the industry dynamics associated with life-cycle stages."
