abstract: "This project investigates the effect of high skill immigration on U.S. workers and firms. The effects that foreign workers have on the labor market outcomes of domestic workers remain unsettled. This research aims to identify causal effects by exploiting randomized lotteries of H-1B visas—the main visa for high skill foreign-born individuals to work in the U.S.—that occurred in 2007 and 2008. Confidential Census data is necessary to examine the lotteries because H-1B visas were randomly awarded to individuals with employment agreements with U.S. firms. Because firms span geographical boundaries, the effects that occur within firms may dissipate when analyzing more aggregate units of observation. Lastly, confidential data is also needed to examine important adjustments that take place by workers or firms, and to clarify the timing and dynamics of such effects."
