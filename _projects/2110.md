abstract: "Social scientists have long studied how social policy affects electoral participation, but causal identification is difficult since citizens are not randomly assigned to receive government benefits. We plan to tackle this question by using data from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) field experiment that sought to move low-income Americans away from concentrated poverty. Funding from the grant will allow us to merge national voter file data with the MTO data so that we can study the downstream effects of receiving housing vouchers on electoral participation for both adult subjects and former child subjects."
