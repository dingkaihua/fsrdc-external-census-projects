abstract: "This research will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by investigating the feasibility of producing model-based estimates of county-level and census tract-level childhood obesity rates using data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), and comparing these rates across urban versus rural designations nationally and across the nine U.S. Census divisions. In the process, the research will also benefit the Bureau by demonstrating the utility of the NSCH data for analyzing social conditions related to childhood obesity, which is associated with poorer health in childhood and predicts later obesity in adulthood.  These latter benefits will demonstrate the utility of the NSCH for the production of obesity estimates for American children at varying levels of geography, a task for which the NSCH is specifically designed.  Based on respondent demographic information, the team will utilize a small area estimation approach, harnessing the flexibility of spatially explicit information to provide model-based small area estimates and associated confidence intervals for the outcome of interest."
