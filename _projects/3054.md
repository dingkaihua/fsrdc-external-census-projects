abstract: "Public early childhood education (ECE) expanded rapidly beginning in the 1980s. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of states funding preschool rose from 4 to 30. Importantly, these programs differed on a number of dimensions from the smaller, much-studied programs of the 1960s and 1970s. Enough time has now passed that we can begin to examine the long-run outcomes of the participants of public ECE in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. We hypothesize that participants will have better long-run outcomes (educational attainment, employment, earnings, etc.) than non-participants, although the differences may be smaller than those between individuals born in the 1960s and 1970s. To understand any observed differences, we will also examine the short- and medium-run mechanisms (parental employment, family earnings, etc.) that mediate children's long-run outcomes. Our analyses will use a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework, the synthetic control method (SCM), and regression discontinuity (RD) designs, as applicable. The project uses restricted-use CPS, ACS, and SIPP data, as well as administrative data on criminality, place of residence, and government assistance; county of birth information for linking adults to their childhood circumstances; and exact date of birth for conducting RD analyses."
