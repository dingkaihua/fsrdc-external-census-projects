abstract: "This project will combine the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service data set on collective bargaining agreement expiration notices (i.e. FMCS F-7 files), the Department of Labor Form 5500 data set on employee ownership at firms (F5500), and data on state adoption of employment protection policies, with the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Longitudinal Employment-Household Dynamics (LEHD), and Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) available from the U.S. Census. By doing so, this project will produce population level estimates of the effect of establishment union presence and employee ownership on workplace racial and gender equity by examining effects on minority and women workers' earnings, earnings gaps, employment levels, and employment representation, as well as on workplace productivity, governance, and ownership structures.  We will test the hypothesis that establishments with unions or employee ownership will exhibit greater gender and racial equity in employment levels, earnings levels and earnings gaps, and employment representation. We will also investigate the degree to which the impact of union presence and employee ownership interact with employment protection policy in the form of wrongful discharge laws and state antidiscrimination laws. For example, do establishments which are unionized and/or covered by employee ownership plans experience less of an impact from state employment protection laws, reflecting that these policies counteract, rather than reinforce, each other? In this case, the interactive effect between employment protection laws and union presence/employee ownership may demonstrate that union membership and/or employee-ownership provides greater preexisting worker voice, so employment protection policies, which also empower workers, provide less impact in these setting. Therefore, employment protection policies would have their greatest impact in non-employee-owned and/or nonunionized workplaces.

We will also test whether unionized workplaces may have greater levels of employee-ownership/participation, and whether these interventions reinforce each other in terms of promoting workplace racial and gender employment equity, workplace improvements in productivity, and improved organizational and management practices that foster less centralized decision-making within firms.  

This project is the first to investigate the relationship between union presence and firm management and decision-making dynamics with a focus on comparing outcomes in innovative employee-owned/participatory workplace structures versus traditional top-down investor-owned governance structures using data from the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) and U.S. Department of Labor Form 5500 Annual Returns/Reports of Employee Benefit Plans."
