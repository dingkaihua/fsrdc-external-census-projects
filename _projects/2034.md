abstract: "This study seeks to understand the impacts of involvement in the criminal justice system, and incarceration in particular, on labor market outcomes. The study will investigate the earnings and employment of individuals who have interacted or will interact with the criminal justice system, as well as the characteristics of the firms that hire them. Involvement in the criminal justice system in the U.S. has large and negative impacts on earnings and employment; however, little is known about the mechanisms that cause this drop in earnings, including the relative contributions of non-employment, limited industry and occupational mobility, and lack of on-the-job earnings growth. Relatedly, there is currently no research into the firms that hire ex-offenders, including their industry and occupational distributions, wage profiles, workforce characteristics, and growth trajectories. It is possible that a large part of the earnings losses associated with having a criminal record comes through sorting of workers to firms in typically low wage or low growth industries. While the focus is on individuals who have been incarcerated, this study will also investigate the impacts of arrest and criminal charging separately."
