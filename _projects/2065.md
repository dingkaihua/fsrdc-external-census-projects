abstract: "The US spends nearly twice on health care as do peer countries, without obtaining better population health outcomes. Hence studying the determinants of productivity of health care firms is of first order importance. I will leverage restricted Census files matched with external data to estimate different measures of firm-level productivity in the health care sector, and then quantify the effects of three different forces - competition, consolidation, and public insurance expansion - on productivity, growth and finances in this sector. These are important questions addressing policy concerns over the dramatic recent consolidation (and accompanying decline in competition) in healthcare, and benefits of taxpayer funded universal insurance coverage. I will combine confidential Census data (e. g. Census of Services, Census of Finance, Insurance & Real Estate, Services Annual Survey, American Community Survey and others), augmented with rich industry data, with sophisticated regression modeling to estimate the parameters of interest.
