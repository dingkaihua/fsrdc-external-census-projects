abstract: "Lead poisoning can have long-lasting consequences, especially on children's health and IQ; therefore, the Consumer Product Safety Commission effectively banned the use of lead in paint in 1978. State and federal laws regulate the disclosure of information concerning lead presence in homes built prior to 1978, as well as abatement. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, professional lead-based paint removal costs between $8 to $15 per square foot, with the average removal project costing about $10,000. This project assesses how the costs imposed by the regulations affect housing prices and home-ownership, while quantifying the health benefits of the regulation. Indeed, the adverse effects of lead-based paint on children's health are likely to be mediated by households' responses to the information regarding lead hazards. This research employs a triple differences approach to estimate the effects of state-level lead-safe housing regulations on the housing market and blood lead levels."
