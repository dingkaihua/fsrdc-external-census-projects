abstract: "California recently introduced a state supplemental Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) with the express purpose of lowering poverty. Similarly, localities within California have increased the minimum wage in the last few years with the goal of decreasing inequality and decreasing poverty. This project seeks to understand how the California EITC and higher minimum wages impact measures of poverty and the behavioral impacts on various outcomes. These will be investigated by looking at small area poverty estimates and by looking at how the EITC and minimum wage affect poverty by those with different demographic characteristics, such as race."
