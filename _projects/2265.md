abstract: "Using data from American Community Survey (ACS) from 2010 to 2017, this project examines the impact of New York City's expansion of universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) as of Fall of 2014 on the labor force participation of mothers with a Pre-K-eligible child.  Any child who turns 4 years old in a given year and residing in NYC for the past year is eligible for enrollment in UPK in September of the coming school year.  Comparing these mothers with other mothers whose youngest child is 1, 2 and 3 years old and with mothers living in adjacent counties in New York Metropolitan Area (NMA) to NYC, we estimate the program's impact on their labor force participation. We analyze potential heterogeneity in the effect on different sub-populations, given that the uptake of the program is more likely among socioeconomically-disadvantaged and single-mother households."
