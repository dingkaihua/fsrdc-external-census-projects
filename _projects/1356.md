abstract: "The project will explore how access to various sources of financing can affect entrepreneurial start up activity. We will also analyze the relationship between access to financing and start up firm performance, productivity, employment growth, and sales, and the extent to which these performance measures relate to successful exit outcomes for private firms through acquisitions and IPOs. Further, prior literature has indicated that innovative startups are the ones that foster the greatest growth in employment and productivity. We will thus also analyze the relationship between access to financing and startup innovative activity. Since greater availability of financing will enhance opportunities for entrepreneurs to invest in their projects, we expect a positive relationship between access to financing and these outcome variables. We will also try to understand the differential effect of the various types of financing options available to startup firms and their impact on the above outcome variables. Moreover, we will test whether these different sources of funding are substitutes or complements (i.e., getting one type of financing allows a firm to obtain another type of financing later on). For instance, venture capitalists screen the investments through a detailed due-diligence process (e.g., Chemmanur, Krishnan, and Nandy (2011)). They may thus choose firms that are successful in obtaining seed financing from angels, which may potentially serve as another screening mechanism. Broadly, we expect to analyze the impact from three different sources of financing:  debt (e.g., bank loans); equity or stakeholder funded (e.g., angel, venture capital, and crowdfunding); and government awards (e.g., SBIR). 

The project will further investigate the extent to which non-employer businesses transition to employer firms, and if an exogenous shift in financing has an enhanced effect on these transitions. Further, an important milestone in the life of an entrepreneurial venture is the entrepreneur's choice of exit and the particular channel of exit, i.e. IPO or acquisition of the entrepreneurial firm. This is important from various perspectives. First, the evolution and the eventual success of a firm will require the ability to raise larger amounts of capital, potentially from public markets. Second, early stage investors such as angel financiers and venture capitalists typically provide capital and support to entrepreneurial ventures with the explicit or implicit understanding that they will exit the investment at a certain stage. Moreover, becoming a public firm or selling off one's venture is considered by many to be the final goal of entrepreneurship. Thus, at least from a financial perspective, in both the early and the later stages of a firm's life, the exit strategy is important. We will analyze if there are significant interactions between the exit strategy of firms and the extent and type of financing of the entrepreneurial firm. A related issue for an entrepreneurial firm is how to keep financing itself as it grows and how to choose between various debt and equity financing sources (which would shape the capital structure of the entrepreneurial firm)."
