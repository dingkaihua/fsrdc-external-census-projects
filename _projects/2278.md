abstract: "Long-standing disparities in labor market outcomes by race are well documented. Many contributors to these disparities have been documented, including discrimination, educational opportunities, and social networks. Since a greater ability to chase economic opportunity should improve anyone's labor market outcomes, an additional potential contributor to labor market disparities is differences in migration patterns. Constraints to migration can take many forms -- from social/cultural constraints to financial constraints. The first goal of this project is to assess whether a greater geographic mis-match between job opportunities and people at different education levels exists among racial and ethnic minorities than among white, non-Hispanics. We will utilize the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey, and the Decennial Census to examine this question.   The project will then investigate the degree to which these distributional differences across race/ethnicity, or mismatch, reflect differential responses to changing job opportunities. This will be done through regression analysis examining the direct relationship between job opportunities and education/race specific populations.  As far as we know, this relationship has not been explored across different demographic/education groups.  Our contribution to the existing literature lies in our efforts to document the differences in responsiveness to education/race specific job opportunities. This will allow us to assess the potential role that migration constraints play in differential labor market outcomes."
