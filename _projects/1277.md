abstract: "This project examines trends in residential segregation and the effects of several waves of government policy upon residential segregation between the 1950s and 2010. Decennial Census microdata from the period between 1960 and 2010 are used to examine four interrelated questions regarding the significance of fair housing legislation and the processes underlying racial residential segregation. This research examines: (1) general patterns of black migration across neighborhoods between 1960 and 2010; (2) the characteristics of black pioneers who move into white neighborhoods; (3) the Schelling process of racial "tipping"; and (4) the role of inter-urban migration in producing residential segregation."
