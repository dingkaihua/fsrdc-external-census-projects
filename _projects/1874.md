abstract: "Innovation is one of the most important factors driving U.S. economic growth. While a large literature uses patents to measure innovation outcomes, relatively few studies consider the decision to patent, or how that decision interacts with other dimensions of business strategy, including R&D investment. Overall, the purpose of this study is to investigate the link between innovation, intellectual property, and firm economic conditions. This research will use data from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey, along with a newly created firm-level link between the Standard Statistical Establishment List, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s data on issued patents, to study the links between innovation and intellectual property. The first part of this project is to understand the interaction between R&D investment decisions and the strategies used by firms to protect intellectual property. This initial descriptive study will be followed by two sets of analyses that will specifically focus on the main economic forces shaping firms’ decisions in innovation. First, we will examine the role of the risks connected with patent litigation in shaping the incentive to patent and innovate. Second, we will examine the role of large credit shocks and how they shape investment in R&D across different dimensions. Overall, this project is designed to better understand the nature of firm innovation and to explore the strategies that firms use to protect their intellectual property."
