abstract: "The project will investigate the relationship between residential segregation and the distribution of community resources and health-promoting establishments over time at the census tract level. The overarching research question which this study addresses is the following: What is the relationship between racial/ethnic residential segregation over time and the distribution of health-promoting community organizations over time across urban space in the United States? More specifically, are racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods less likely to have many and diverse health-related organizations compared to (non-Hispanic) White neighborhoods?  What other contextual factors are related to the distribution of such resources?"
