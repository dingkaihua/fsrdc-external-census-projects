abstract: "Over the last three decades, the federal government has attempted to balance the dual and often conflicting goals of promoting economic activity and environmental quality. The tension between these goals arises because regulations that reduce environmental degradation are likely to hamper economic progress. This project will examine one of the most important examples of such a tension – the federal government’s regulation of air pollution through the Clean Air Act. It will be the first comprehensive attempt to empirically estimate the direct costs and benefits of this regulatory program at the plant level. The proposed project will exploit pollution categories established by the EPA. As directed by the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments, the EPA established separate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) – a minimum level of air quality that all counties are required to meet – for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. As part of this legislation every county annually receives separate nonattainment or attainment designations for each of the six pollutants. The nonattainment designation is reserved for counties whose air contains concentrations of the relevant pollutant that exceed the federal standard. Emitters of the regulated pollutant in nonattainment counties are subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. Non-polluters are free from regulation in both categories of counties. This division of counties sets up an interesting quasi-experiment for measuring some of the direct effects of regulation. In principle, it is possible to identify these effects by comparing changes in outcomes in nonattainment and attainment counties. An essential element of this project is the creation of a unique data file that contains plant-level information on pollution emissions and economic activity, as well as detailed measures of regulation. I have already created this file by linking the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (and the Census of Manufactures) for the years 1987 through 1997. The former contains plant-specific releases of more than 600 toxics into the environment, including whether the release was into the air, water, or ground. The latter provides information on plant-level employment, investment, shipments, and other characteristics (e.g., industry, age, and location). This plant-level file will be merged with one containing the annual, pollutant-specific, attainment/nonattainment designations. The application of this quasi-experiment to the above data file will provide estimates for a class of questions that cannot  e posed with traditional public use files. I will estimate the effect of attainment/nonattainment status on pollution emissions, total employment, capital stock, and output. These results will be useful for many purposes. For instance, it will be possible to calculate the regulation-induced trade-off between environmental quality and employment; this trade-off has not been estimated previously but is central to any debate about environmental regulations. Additionally, I will fit plant-level production functions where pollution emissions are treated as an input. The nonattainment variables will serve as instruments for pollution emissions in these equations. The estimation of these equations will produce measures of the increased costs associated with mandated reductions in pollution. It will also be possible to gain insight into how firms adjust their production processes to comply with regulation. In summary, this project’s results will provide an improved understanding of the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations and of how plants alter their production patterns to optimally comply with them. The predominant purpose of this project is to benefit the Census Bureau’s program and it will do so in at least three ways. First, in addition to linking the TRI to the LRD, this project will produce a cross-walk between the LRD PPNs and EPA establishment IDs. This will link the LRD to all plant-level EPA data sets. Thus, the project should be of great use for researchers interested in examining other aspects of pollution releases by manufacturing plants. Second, the project will produce estimates of the economic costs of environmental regulations and these estimates will serve as an important complement to cost estimates from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE). Third, this project’s results may be helpful in identifying methods to refine the PACE’s questionnaire in order to elicit more valuable information."
