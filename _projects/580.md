abstract: "Making an initial public offering (IPO) of equity, otherwise known as “going public,” is an important event in the life of a firm. In this research project, we will analyze how the product market performance of a firm affects the timing of its going public decision.  While the existing literature has documented that firms have poor operating performance (as measured by profits) in the years immediately after going public, the precise reason for this poor performance has not been previously addressed. We propose to identify the sources of this poor performance by studying how a firm’s productivity, sales, market share, labor costs and employment levels, material costs, rental and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures change subsequent to going public. This analysis will provide important information on the way in which firms report the value of these measures as collected by U.S. Census Bureau programs.   In addition, public firms in general are under more scrutiny and monitoring by regulatory agencies than private firms because once a firm becomes public, it has to file its relevant information on a regular basis to the securities exchange and other regulatory authorities, and answer to its shareholders. Thus, the public financial disclosure requirement may strengthen the firm’s internal data collection and reporting, and this in turn may lead to a better response rate and better reporting quality to the surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. By identifying the public versus private status of establishments in the Census Bureau databases, we will also be able to analyze the data quality of these establishments prior to and after going public, and report if there are any changes in the quality of the data reported by various establishments after this change in public versus private status."
