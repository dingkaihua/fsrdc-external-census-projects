abstract: "This research will examine the effects of the bursting of the housing bubble during the 2007â€“2009 period on the Tiebout-like sorting pattern of households within and across communities, using data from the American Community Survey. The areas of interest include three large metropolitan areas that experienced varying degrees of housing market impacts: Phoenix, Denver, and St. Louis. The testable hypothesis of this research project is that the housing crisis caused a significant resorting of individuals within and across communities in large metropolitan areas. We will conduct the analysis using two empirical strategies. The first is a descriptive approach in which homogeneity metrics will be computed and aggregated to the city, or borough, level in order to identify the varying degrees of homogeneity within and across communities. Such metrics will be used to gauge the intensity of change in these measures of homogeneity over time. The second approach will rely on regression analysis in order to identify which explanatory variables are driving these changes in homogeneity over time and across geography. This research will provide one of the most comprehensive pictures as to how households were forced to migrate during the Great Recession."
