abstract: "It is well documented that entrepreneurial activity in the U.S. has seen a secular decline in the last three decades. Yet, it is less known about to what extent different entrepreneurial frictions may affect the gap between large and small firms and what can be done to support small businesses. Given limited resources, small firms often face various frictions or barriers to technology, information, and investment opportunities. In this project, we propose to examine and quantify the effect of these frictions and explore approaches to reduce the gap between small and large firms.

Unlike large corporations, small firms often have limited resources to keep up with the latest technology, and information or adopt effective managerial practices, resulting in lower productivity and growth. To understand these factors on the performance of small firms and, ultimately, the gap between large and small firms, this project will examine whether small businesses that had access to technological innovations and innovative management knowledge had better business outcomes and a higher rate of survival than businesses that did not. In addition to the general effect, we will also examine the variation of effects by service type (i.e., technology implementation vs. training in managerial practices), firm type (i.e., size, age, or prior performance), and location (rural vs. urban; market concentration; competition, etc.). Our findings will offer insights to small manufacturing firms in the U.S. to identify the specific types of services that will result in better business outcomes and improve their ability to be competitive in the domestic and international markets.

To conduct our research, we will rely on datasets that provide information on services received by small businesses and Census data containing business profile information and business outcome indicators. This research will utilize external datasets from the Small Business Administration and Census data such as the County Business Patterns Business Register, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Survey of Business Owners, the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, the Annual Business Survey, the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures."
