abstract: "This research examines the interaction of financial markets and trade shocks on the domestic manufacturing sector. The analysis combines data on exposure to foreign trade with restricted-use microdata on employment (from the Longitudinal Business Database and Business Register), manufacturing activity (from the Census of Manufactures and Annual Survey of Manufactures), on imports and exports (from the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database), and with publicly available data on firm financials. The goal of the research is to measure the extent to which financial frictions affect adjustment to trade at public and private firms. The relevant margins of adjustment include employment, firm entry and exit, factor adjustments, and entry into import and export markets. In addition, this research also examines how increased trade exposure affects industry merger and consolidation patterns."
