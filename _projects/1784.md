abstract: "This research studies the economic consequences of the prison construction boom in the United States. During the last three decades, growth in the prison population in the United States has been the largest in history. One of the biggest challenges in siting new prisons is resistance from local communities. Commonly cited negative impacts of prisons include falling property values, stunted local economic growth, and damage to the community’s reputation and ability to retain and attract businesses. However, prisons are not always unwelcome. Many rural towns have chosen to tie their economies to prisons, believing the institutions provide recession-proof jobs and often a much-needed boost to the stagnant local economy. Using restricted-use data from the Decennial Census and American Community Survey, this research evaluates the effect of prison openings during 1980–2010 on local housing values and rents, local labor markets and neighborhood demographics, as well as the overall welfare impact on residents. The research will also evaluate the Census Bureau's practice of including incarcerated individuals as residents when tabulating public-use community statistics, in light of changing circumstances of the U.S. correctional system."
