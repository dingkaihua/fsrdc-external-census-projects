abstract: "This project examines the relationship between media messages about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health insurance enrollment. The researchers first examine the associations between media market-level characteristics of broadcast media and the market-level socio-demographics of the populations plausibly exposed to those media in late 2013. They then examine the associations between the volume and tone of media messages about the ACA with changes in insurance enrollment from 2013 to 2014/2015. They do so by estimating individual-level models of insurance coverage on indicator variables for the post-ACA period interacted with the market-level variables and a host of state- and county-level controls. The study will contribute new understanding of an important health issue: the influence of news and advertising media on insurance enrollment during the implementation of the ACA."
