abstract: "Policymakers have increasingly turned to cash transfers to alleviate poverty, improve outcomes among the disadvantaged, and reduce inequality. However, little is known about how such transfers may affect labor market outcomes, health, childbearing, or use of other public programs. While several studies have investigated these questions in the context of developing (e.g., Haushofer and Shapiro 2016) or European (e.g., Cesarini et al. 2016) countries, less is known about the impact of these transfers in the United States. This study will provide new, timely evidence on this topic by analyzing the impact of a large-scale randomized controlled trial using data that links information on study participants to Census-held administrative records on mortality, use of public programs, labor market participation, and childbearing."
