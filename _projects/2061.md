abstract: "The need for home repairs is a critical quality-of-life challenge for many low- and moderate-income households and communities. Despite the clear utility for policymaking and program development, few publicly-available, neighborhood-level housing quality indicators exist. To address this information gap, this research develops small area estimates of home repair need for occupied housing units using American Housing Survey (AHS), American Community Survey (ACS), and proprietary repair cost data. We estimate the unit-level total cost of repairs by relating cost estimates to housing problems reported in the AHS. AHS units are then merged with publicly available tract- and region-level data from the ACS using geographic identifiers available in the restricted-use AHS file. We develop multilevel regression models to predict repair costs using characteristics of the unit, surrounding census tract, and region. We apply the resulting models to publicly-available data to produce aggregate tract-level estimates using a post-stratification approach. The resulting estimates will help decision makers understand the scope and magnitude of home repair needs and target resources accordingly. "
