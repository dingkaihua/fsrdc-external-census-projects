abstract: "This project examines how firms internally reallocate resources (e.g., labor, capital) over the business cycle, with emphasis on the recent financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009 (the “Great Recession”). This research assesses capital stock imputation from Census Bureau data, assesses the geographical classification of establishments, and builds a bridge among several establishment- and employee-level datasets."
