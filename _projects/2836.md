abstract: "Hurricane winds and flooding are responsible for the majority of economic losses from disasters in the United States (NOAA, 2021). In this project, we aim to investigate how hurricanes impact rental prices, rental housing stock, and household adaptation strategies. The effect of hurricane disasters on housing sale prices has been well documented. However, little is known about how housing costs change for renters, even though renters make up one-third of the US Population. We hypothesize that after a hurricane disaster: 1) rental prices increase, 2) supply of rental housing decreases, 3) renters and homeowners migrate at different rates, and 4) insurance attenuates the migratory responses of homeowners more than renters. To test our hypotheses, we plan to use American Community Survey data and American Housing Survey data to create a panel at the Census block group-level and household-level. We combine this panel data with IBTracs spatial hurricane data, as well as FEMA aid and insurance data. We use staggered difference-in-differences and an event study framework as our main specifications. We leverage hyper-specific data about hurricane tracks and wind speeds as a source of exogenous variation, comparing areas that were directly hit with a hurricane to comparable control areas. Importantly, we  account for common difference-and-differences issues at the forefront of the econometrics literature. This research leads to a richer understanding of how a vulnerable population is impacted by and adapts to natural disasters. This will have implications for policymakers concerned with mitigating the effect of severe weather events exacerbated by climate change."
