abstract: "We plan to link the AHS National files from 1985 to 2003 and the AHS Metro files from 1980 to 2003) to the confidential 1980, 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census long form data at the census tract level in order to investigate how rapidly "neighborhoods" (census tracts) change.  We propose to use census tract measures from 1980, 1990 and 2000 to identify neighborhood characteristics, such as the distribution of income, education and race within the neighborhood.  Linking this to American Housing Survey (AHS) data allows us to study the characteristics of in-migrants, out-migrants and stayers within different neighborhoods.  "
