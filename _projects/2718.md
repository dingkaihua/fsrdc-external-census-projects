abstract: "This project studies changes in U.S. firms' trade with China and other countries, including a focus on when and how firms increased their trade with China, as well as any subsequent reallocation away from China toward other countries.  Using a sample comprised of the merged Longitudinal Business Database and Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transaction Database, I begin with a descriptive analysis of the extent of firms' sourcing of goods from China and changes in that sourcing over time.  Next, I consider potential factors driving changes in U.S. firms' trade such as changes in international trade policy, economic developments in China, and environmental factors.  Lastly, I consider how changes in U.S. firms' trading behavior affect aspects of their domestic operations such as employment, investment, and value of shipments, drawing on data from the Economic Censuses and Annual Surveys.  The findings of this research project will be of interest to researchers given China's importance in U.S. trade and the rise of numerous factors that could affect the U.S.-China trading relationship."
