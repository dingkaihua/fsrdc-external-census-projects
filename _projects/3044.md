abstract: "Regional economic development crucially depends on human resources and natural resources.  In particular, highly-educated professionals and entrepreneurs are expected to have important effects creating local jobs and increasing incomes and well-being for themselves and others.  Primary, secondary, and higher education institutions help build, attract, and retain local human capital, but access to high-quality education institutions varies considerably across geographic areas and lack of educational access is expected to especially hinder non-metropolitan areas and smaller metropolitan areas.  Furthermore, natural resources play an important role in job creation for less densely populated areas.  However, some natural resources may enhance human resources, while other natural resources may hinder the creation and retention of human capital.  For example, mountains, lakes, and parks may be especially attractive natural amenities that attract and retain skilled workers and entrepreneurs, while oil and gas fracking activity creates jobs but also environmental disamenities that may push away skilled workers and entrepreneurs that are vital for long-run economic development.  We propose to investigate these and related issues to better understand how human resources and natural resources shape regional economic activity using restricted access microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2000 decennial census long-form surveys.  Restricted access data are critical for this analysis because publicly available microdata do not identify counties with population less than 100,000 and do not identify the specific county where individuals were born.  Our project will deliver benefit to the Census Bureau by analyzing demographic, social, and economic processes that affect Census bureau programs (Criterion 2) and creating new estimates of population characteristics as authorized under Title 13, Chapter 5 (Criterion 11)."
