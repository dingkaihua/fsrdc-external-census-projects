abstract: "In this research, we estimate factors associated with internal and international migration flows to the United States, taking advantage of restricted-use data on current residence at the block-group level and previous residence at the county level. The analyses use a historical perspective, investigating data from Decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys between 1950 and 2016. Individual characteristics in the models include individual characteristics, as well as distance between counties and population size, which is consistent with gravity models and the regional equilibrium framework. Treatment of spatial dependence, by measuring the influence of neighboring areas at origin and destination on the likelihood of migrating, is also employed. "
