abstract: "The majority of research on job accessibility is limited by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), where a reliance on aggregate data obscures important differences in commuting times that vary at the sub-block level. This is especially true for commutes made using public transit, where walking makes up a substantial portion of commutes. We propose to improve estimates of commuting time and accessibility by worker income and industry, as well as estimating the extent of the MAUP in comparable studies, by using precise origin-destination pairs derived from linked American Community Survey and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. We supplement these data with detailed, external information about transit networks and associated travel times.  Results will yield improved estimates of job accessibility by income, industry, and time of day for the nation as a whole as well as for several different city and county typologies related to transit availability and commuting patterns."
