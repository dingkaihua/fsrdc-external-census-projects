abstract: "We describe the role of entrepreneurial activity in regional dynamism, with an emphasis on firm entry, innovation, and labor mobility, using matched Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data and R&D data from the Census Bureau. We analyze economic and labor market dynamism across geographic areas by (1) using the introduction of innovative entrepreneurs to a region to identify and quantify agglomeration and productivity spillovers; (2) investigating the role of entrepreneurship in facilitating regional growth; and (3) characterizing the skills profile of workers employed in entrepreneurial firms. We will also investigate the changing role of entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy in relation to the 2007â€“2009 Great Recession and previous recessions, as well as how entrepreneurship varies by region across the United States."
