abstract: "The goal of this project is to provide insights into the causes and consequences of firm productivity and dynamics (entry, exit and growth), with particular emphasis on the role of human capital and a secondary emphasis on regulatory factors.  We will study how firm performance, including the level and growth of employment, profitability, wages, productivity and survival are affected by human capital (particularly through turnover of workers and entrepreneurs) and regulatory factors. To understand potential bias from the endogeneity of human capital (e.g., good firms attracting high human capital and low turnover rather than vice versa), we will analyze the underlying drivers of worker and entrepreneur mobility, including factors related to worker-firm match quality, firm adjustment costs, worker and entrepreneur moving costs, and demand and productivity shocks."
