abstract: "In this project, based on the LEHD, LBD, and various external datasets, we examine the two-way effects between individuals' employment decisions and corporate culture related policies, an understudied facet in corporate governance. To investigate the effects, we plan to use the voting outcomes of firm-culture-related shareholder proposals as an instrumental variable for culture changes of a firm. We expect to see a decrease in employee separation rates after the passing of a shareholder proposal regarding firm culture, especially among the employees with high consciousness to firm culture/social values. In the second part of the project, we will further shed light on how the culture-related firm policies/decisions and the resulting human capital consequences affect firm performance in innovation, international competition, and financial management."
