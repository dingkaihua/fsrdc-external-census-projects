abstract: "This study examines the impact of the decline of the coal mining industry over the last two decades (2000 - 2019) on labor market outcomes and migration flows. We use the restricted-access Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure files in conjunction with detailed mine-level panel data covering all coal and metal mines in the U.S. Exploiting exogenous variations that affect domestic coal production based on a geological feature of coal mining and the timing of the shale boom, we estimate the causal effects of coal decline on foregone earnings and unemployment duration of stayers and leavers in coal-rich communities. We also investigate racial and income disparities and firm heterogeneity in the coal decline effects, providing empirical evidence on the distributional impacts of just energy transition."
