abstract: "At the end of the 1990s, the federal government reorganized the way it provides subsidized housing assistance. As a result, voucher users surpassed the number of public housing residents, and Public Housing Authorities began to serve new tenants who are making affirmative steps to self-sufficiency as opposed to households experiencing the greatest housing-related needs. Using life table analysis, this project investigates how these changes have affected the length of stay of tenants in subsidized housing programs as well as the relative lengths of stay in public housing compared to other types of subsidized programs. Second, it examines the pathways that residents take to exit subsidized housing and implement a discrete-time multinomial logit model of the socioeconomic determinants of exits into the private housing market that takes account not only of the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals but also of the local housing and unemployment conditions. Finally, it traces the ability of exits from subsidized housing programs to improve the living conditions of the ones who transition into the private housing market. The research uses all panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) covering the period between 1990 and 2008 as well as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the period between 1969 and 2008."
