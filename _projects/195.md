abstract: "In the 1990s many states adopted reforms to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the largest cash welfare program in the U.S. While much of the focus of these reforms has been on moving recipients from welfare to work, many reforms were also directed at affecting demographic decisions. Welfare reform hopes to reduce the incidence of non-marital fertility and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Our ongoing project examines whether the reform provisions initiated as state waivers—and in some cases incorporated into the national legislation—deterred women from becoming and remaining unmarried mothers. Our specific aims in the project are to model female headship decisions (unmarried motherhood) and assess the impact of welfare reform provisions on those decisions while controlling for local economic conditions. So far, we have used data from the 1990,92,93 SIPP linked by respondent’s residence to state policy variables and county labor market variables to estimate models of female headship and transitions into and out of female headship. We use confidential geography for county of residence to help separate labor market effects from state policy effects. Results to date indicate that waivers appear to have effects, but further work is needed to understand the mechanism at work. This proposal requests access to additional data to provide better longitudinal coverage and larger sample sizes for our analysis."
