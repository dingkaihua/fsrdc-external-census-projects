abstract: "The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employment discrimination against Americans with disabilities, yet many individuals with disabilities continue to experience difficulty entering the labor market. While there is a wealth of research on the employment outcomes, wage earnings, and government program participation of people with disabilities in the U.S., there is relatively little consideration of how place of residence influences these trends. This project has three objectives: (1) to investigate the effect of urbanicity (how urban or rural a locality is) on the differential employment outcomes between people with and without disabilities; (2) to examine the influence of urbanicity and commute patterns (specifically commute time and travel mode) on the variance in wage earnings between people with and without disabilities; and (3) to analyze how urbanicity affects the degree to which Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients respond to survey questions related to disability. This research focuses on the working-age population (18-64 years of age) surveyed by the Census Bureau in 2000 and 2010-2014, two points in time following the enactment of the ADA. "
