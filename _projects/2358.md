abstract: "The affordability and accessibility of housing has generated renewed interest following sustained increases in house prices in the largest American cities. While local governments have responded through various policies, understanding of housing and labor markets at a localized level is still relatively superficial. This project will develop a rich understanding of many aspects of local housing and labor markets. Using data available through the Census RDC--in particular the LEHD--this project proposes to understand (1) how households decide where to live within a city (e.g. proximity to employers, other location-based amenities, physical characteristics of housing, and price) and (2) how real estate stock passes through different geographies and demographic groups (i.e. the ripple effects of new development via the chains of vacancies created as households move). Because household and firm location choices may influence access to employment (including entrepreneurial entry and self-employment opportunities), this project will also produce population estimates that allow for understanding the labor market at a very localized level."
