abstract: "Historically responsibility for the provision of human services in the United States has been shared between public and private nonprofit forms of organization. This has changed substantially in the last thirty years with the increasing commercialization of the human services industry as evidenced by the increasing presence of for-profit organizations. While this change in the mix of organizational forms in this industry has resulted in a great deal of literature debating its nature, desirability and future implications, there has been little emphasis on testing arguments about how it occurred or empirically examining its effects. One important reason for this has been an absence of good quality longitudinal data. A second reason has been a tendency among researchers and analysts to emphasize description, prescription or evaluation in their studies, as opposed to explanation and the development of validated theoretical knowledge. Hence, using advanced forms of analysis to deepen theoretical understanding of factors contributing to this change and it effects has not been a central concern. This research proposes to address these constraints first by working to obtain good longitudinal data by modifying the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and second, by using macro-level theories of organization to develop hypotheses about how this change occurred as well as about the nature of the processes underlying certain of its effects. First, on modifying the LBD, we propose to do this by linking with the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and subsequently coding a variable from 1974 to the present for all 5 four digit industries in the 8300 SIC code classification (Social Services) that accurately differentiates establishments in these industries by legal form, i.e., whether or not they are tax-exempt. This not only will result in data appropriate for our research but also will produce significant benefits for the Census Bureau in the form of improved data quality and population estimates and, to a lesser degree, improved methodology. Subsequent to improving the LBD, we propose to focus initially on two questions about changes in the 5 four digit industries in the 8300 (Social Services) SIC code. The first question concerns transformations in legal form, from tax-exempt (nonprofit) to taxable (for-profit) status, and inquires into the survival value to an establishment of changing its legal form from nonprofit to for-profit, or vice versa, i.e., does the risk of dying increase or decrease as a result of such transformations. The second question concerns how variation over time in local environmental conditions affects the mix of legal forms of establishments in that environment by how it influences their rates of births and deaths. We anticipate that the answers to these questions will be of substantial interest to other researchers as well as to analysts, decision-makers and administrators."
