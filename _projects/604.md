abstract: "Using the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey, Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and Census of Manufacturers materials trailer files, this project documents trends in pollution abatement expenditures, materials use, and toxic releases over time, and explores if plants have become more pollution efficient. Estimates will be generated to analyze how pollution abatement, toxic material use, and TRI public disclosure laws have affected firm-level productivity and induced technical change.  Here, the identification of the effect of TRI on productivity comes both from the time-series variation in emissions of firms subject to the disclosure requirements, and from the cross-section variation between firms that fall under the disclosure rules or are exempt from them. The project will perform an analysis of induced technology adoption by firms â€“ both the adoption of general technologies as well as abatement technologies. This project will also evaluate the quality of and relationships between in data on pollution abatement, output, productivity, innovation, and toxic and other pollutant releases. "
