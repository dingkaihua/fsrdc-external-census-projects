abstract: "Although large and small firms generally pay similar premiums for health insurance, it is widely believed that these premiums purchase less generous plans for small firms. This lower “actuarial value,” along with the lower wages paid by many small firms, may help to explain why many of them do not offer coverage and why many workers in these firms decline it when offered. The actuarial value of a plan is the percentage of medical expense that it will pay for a covered population. It allows us to compare the adequacy of coverage across plans and make value-adjusted comparisons of premiums. While an extensive literature monitors the prevalence of employer-sponsored health insurance across states and firm sizes, surprisingly little has been published about the actuarial value of this insurance and how it varies across states, firm sizes and plan types. This project will examine variations in the actuarial value and value-adjusted price of employer-sponsored health care benefits. It will also examine the financial protection that group insurance affords persons with differing levels of health care use. Finally, it will improve our understanding of why some employees decline to take-up coverage and why some employers don’t offer coverage, by adding the actuarial value of the health care benefit to the list of explanatory factors. The major study database is the Census Bureau’s 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Survey (MEPS-IC). AHRQ’s MEPS Household Survey will also be used together with Watson Wyatt software to simulate the payment of medical claims for a standard employer-sponsored population. Based on these simulations, an actuarial value will be calculated for each of the MEPS-IC health plans. Watson Wyatt, a leading actuarial and benefits consulting firm, will collaborate with the Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET) on this study. The study will produce statistical models and at least one journal article that explore these dynamics of job-based health insurance. This project will greatly enhance the MEPS-IC data by adding the actuarial value for each health plan. This proposal has been approved for a $180,000 grant from the Commonwealth Fund. In addition to evaluating and documenting inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPSIC health plan data, we will recommend recodes or imputations to address them. These recodes and imputations can be added to the MEPS-IC data for use by future researchers at the RDC. Watson Wyatt will estimate the actuarial value of each health plan in the MEPS-IC database. The result will be a “benefit rate” that represents the percentage of charges each plan would pay if that plan were offered to a standard population. We will also estimate the plan medical expense and beneficiary out-of-pocket expense for the top ten percent of users, the top 25 percent of users, the top 50 percent of users and the bottom 50 percent of users. These new variables will be required for the proposed project and they will be added to the MEPS-IC file for use by future researchers at the RDC. In the process of calculating the actuarial value for each plan, we will also evaluate and document any internal inconsistencies or other deficiencies in the MEPS-IC plan data. Simulating the actuarial value of a plan is an excellent way to evaluate these data quality issues, because it requires comprehensive examination of plan provisions and the manner in which they interact. The addition of actuarial value to the MEPS-IC file will allow the calculation the mean actuarial value for the population of health plans offered by private sector firms. It will also allow us to profile the distribution of actuarial value of health plans at various points in the distribution. We will calculate these at the 90th percentile, the 75th percentile, the 50th percentile, the 25th percentile and the 10th percentile of actuarial value. We are also prepared to estimate other health plan population characteristics, including premiums, employer contributions, and health plan cost-sharing provisions."
