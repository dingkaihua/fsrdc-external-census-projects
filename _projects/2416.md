abstract: "This project will quantify the impact of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act on the long-run economic and social status of racial and ethnic persons, using birth cohorts that were differentially affected due to the timing of policy implementation across counties. This project will also consider indirect effects on other subpopulations that may be affected via spillovers. Finally, this project will also consider mechanisms through which legal changes cause improvements in economic outcomes, such as labor market and housing outcomes. The researchers will quantify employment outcomes for various demographic groups, including minority groups that civil rights legislation targeted, as well as groups that may have been impacted indirectly."
