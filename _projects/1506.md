abstract: "This project aims to assess whether economic, political, and natural disaster shocks abroad promoted migration from developing countries to the United States (and its states and municipalities) from 1960 until the present. This work augments and develops preliminary work suggesting a link between hurricanes in Central America and the Caribbean and subsequent migration inflows to the U.S. from those regions. Establishing such a relationship requires reliable, year-by-year estimates of migration flows from foreign countries into the United States. Surveys that ask respondents for their country of birth and year of entry yield counts that are likely to be noisy and unreliable for use in empirical work. This project seeks to exploit the richness of the full-count Long Form Decennial Censuses from 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, along with the full-count ACS surveys from 1996-2013 (and 2014-2018, when available). Access to these data allows construction of precise, year-by-year counts of immigrants. Furthermore, since the Long Form Census responses will not be constrained by categories such as “Other Caribbean,” the data will also increase the country-by-year sample size, allowing for more precise regression estimates."
