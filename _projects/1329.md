abstract: "This research examines locational attainment, and in particular, the changing ability of households to translate individual traits into access to high-quality neighborhoods and whether existing rental and mortgage subsidies facilitate or hinder access to such neighborhoods for their recipients. With few exceptions the extant literature on locational attainment has not considered temporal trends nor how housing assistance might facilitate or retard access to different types of neighborhoods. For poorer individuals, housing assistance is likely to be an important determinant of the type of neighborhood they are able to reside in. Housing assistance allows the recipients to live in housing they could otherwise not afford. Conversely, project based housing assistance and especially public housing has a long history of confining its clientele to the poorest and least desirable neighborhoods. This project uses decades of restricted-use American Housing Survey (AHS) data, which allows for ideal neighborhood definitions at the census tract level. This research yields important insights into socioeconomic conditions and the effects of housing programs and subsidies."
