abstract: "We propose to study determinants of decisions to quit smoking by analyzing retrospective smoking history data from the NLS Younger Women cohort.  Those data have been underutilized in research on smoking behavior.  They are interesting from a substantive point of view because the prime-child bearing ages of the women in that sample spanned important policy changes related to smoking. In particular, in 1985 the US Surgeon General required warning labels to be attached to every third cigarette package that specifically warned pregnant women about the dangers of smoking to fetuses.  We would like to include, as a major focus of our study, the cigarette taxes in each state (and potentially county) of residence.  The county identifiers will allow us to identify individuals living in high tax states but close to the border of a state with lower taxes.  Their effective cigarette price is likely to be lower if it is possible for them to shop across the state line (as is the case for residents of New York who live close to Pennsylvania). Although the project proposes to study only the behavior of the NLS Younger Women, we may extend the analysis to include the NLS Older Men and NLS Older Women. The retrospective smoking information in the NLS Original Cohorts is of particular interest because  we can match young women with mothers and fathers and control the smoking behavior of parents and because the sample periods span a very long time over which taxes changed dramatically.  Thus, we would like to attach the state (and county) identifiers to respondents in the NLS Older Men and NLS Mature Women cohorts as well.  Another advantage of the NLS surveys is that we have access to the geocode files of the NLS Youth 1979 and the NLS Youth 1997 samples.  The addition of the NLS Original Cohort geocodes will therefore allow us to analyze four decades of smoking behavior using the similarly designed NLS surveys."
