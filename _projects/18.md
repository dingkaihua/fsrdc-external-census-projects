abstract: "Prior work using the LRD has demonstrated considerable plant-level heterogeneity in productivity (and, to a lesser extent, wages), and that much of this "plant effect" persists over time. This project examines those plants that experience large movement in their relative productivity, or in their relative wages, over the LRD time period. In particular, we wish to estimate the likelihood of sizeable (and consistent) movement in relative productivity or wages as a function of industry, plant size, firm size, sales growth, and geography (urban/rural, region). Besides estimating statistical models, we wish to construct a 5x5 tabulation of "beginning-of-period quintile" versus "end-of-period quintile" for productivity and for wages."
