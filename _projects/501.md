abstract: "The research has four goals that require use of the 1990 and 2000 long form data. First, we will test various definitions of mixed-race households using 2000 multiracial data with a view to maximizing compatibility for comparisons with 1990 single-race data. This testing will identify locations and scales where temporal comparisons are most sensitive to definitional issues in 2000. Second, we intend to map and analyze the neighborhood geographies of mixed-race households in 1990 and 2000. In light of concerns about disclosure risk for small populations in small areas, we are interested in developing procedures available for effective cartographic representations of mixed-race household geography that do not violate confidentiality protections. The third aim of the proposed research investigates the effect of increased rates of mixing within households on neighborhood segregation measures. The fourth aim of the proposed research centers on how racial identity is reported for the children of mixed-race couples. Specifically, to what extent does this choice reflect the particulars of household and/or neighborhood characteristics."
