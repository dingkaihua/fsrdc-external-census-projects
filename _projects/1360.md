abstract: "Hispanics comprise an increasing proportion of the U.S. population, particularly in urban areas, and thus profoundly shape urban neighborhoods. One recent phenomenon occurring in Hispanic neighborhoods is socioeconomic ascent--neighborhoods experiencing increases in residents' household income, rents, house values, educational and occupational attainment. This project seeks to understand the demographic processes underlying these changes using quantitative analyses of restricted-use Census and American Community Survey microdata on tracts in metropolitan areas in the U.S. Specifically, I will explore the demographic causes of Hispanic neighborhood socioeconomic ascent--whether ascent is due to long-time residents' fortunes improving, new residents moving in, or exit of longtime residents--and how these processes vary across metropolitan areas. Documenting these changes in Hispanic neighborhoods will provide a new perspective on inequality in metropolitan areas as the U.S. population becomes increasingly diverse, and it will generate hypotheses for further research about how living in these neighborhoods is shaping the lives of Hispanics."
