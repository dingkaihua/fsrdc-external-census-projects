abstract: "This project aims to use household/house level data from Corelogic (and BlackKnight), the American Community Survey (ACS), the American Housing Survey (AHS) and the 2010 Decennial Census to understand the geography of house prices, housing returns and household borrowing across neighborhoods within metropolitan areas. The primary goal of this project is to estimate how market house values, rents and borrowing behavior vary across housing and neighborhood characteristics using a rich set of characteristics including its precise location. Using these estimates, the project will compare how measures of value across these datasets. The project will also estimate the effects of selection by tenure on the hedonic estimates."
