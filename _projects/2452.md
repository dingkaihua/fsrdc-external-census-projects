abstract: "The proposed project will assess trends in response rates to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the reasons for declining response rates for the period of 1996-2020. The project will give special attention to nonresponse among racial/ethnic minorities, residents of communities with high concentration of immigrants with varied socioeconomic conditions, and (by using data collected after the 2016 NCVS redesign) residents of different citizenship status. Moreover, the project will examine the implications of nonresponse and nonresponse bias for research on criminal victimization and victims' decision to call the police and other entities (e.g., victim service providers and medical professionals) for help. The purpose is to develop ways for reducing nonresponse and develop adjustments (if needed) for any observed nonresponse bias to achieve a better understanding of factors that affect victimization and victim help-seeking behaviors."
