abstract: "In this project, we will quantify the ways by which large manufacturing facilities contribute to local economic well-being. In so doing, we will provide evidence about the cost-effectiveness of increasingly popular government incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to locate or remain in a community. Since manufacturing decline has been ongoing for decades, we require data from the Longitudinal Business Database, Annual Survey and Census of Manufactures starting 1963. To identify effects to the local economy we will use several Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Infrastructure Files. The persistent decline of the manufacturing sector in theUnited States overthe past 30 years has had profound implications for communities dependent on manufacturing plants for their economic livelihood. What happens when those plants closeor leave?"
