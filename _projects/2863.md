abstract: "We investigate the relationship between government spending shocks and product-market concentration at the local level using data from the Longitudinal Business Database and the associated economic censuses from the Census Bureau. To estimate causal effects of local government spending, we exploit the fact that many federal spending programs to local areas depend on local population levels, and that local population is estimated with two different methodologies depending on whether the year is a Census or a non-Census year. Our preliminary findings suggest a permanent increase in local product-market concentration following positive shocks to government spending. We then develop a model in the spirit of Aghion and Howitt (1992) where competition discourages laggard firms from innovating but encourages neck-and-neck firms to innovate. Together with the effect of competition on the equilibrium industry structure, we provide the conditions under which a permanent increase in government spending leads to higher industry concentration. We then expect to show that these theoretical conditions hold in the data. Our results shed light on the unintended consequences of increased government spending, and its potential relationship to increasing concentration and profits in the United States."
