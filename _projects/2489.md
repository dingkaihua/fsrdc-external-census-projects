abstract: "There is growing interest in inequality and social mobility in the United States. However, most of these studies share one important limitation: they analyze almost exclusively the role of men in social mobility. This is because of the general lack of data on women's socioeconomic status (SES), such as income or occupation. We propose a methodology allowing researchers to calculate the transmission of social status from and to women without directly observing it, by using information from various (male) relatives. Moreover, discussing the role of women in social mobility naturally leads to consideration of the role of assortative mating. This can be a powerful source of social immobility, and so studying intergenerational status transmission and assortative mating together can yield new insights.

The standard model in social mobility implicitly assumes that only the father's SES affects the son's SES. We consider a simple extension to that model and consider that both the father's and the mother's SES affects the son's SES. In the absence of information about the SES of women, the only empirical estimate available is the correlation between the father's and son's SESs. Even if we were only interested in the direct effect of the father, we cannot get a consistent estimate if we only have information on the father and the son. We propose a new empirical methodology that allows us to estimate transmission from both men and women, as well as assortative mating, by using data on other male relatives through the maternal line.  Using linked family trees, we can estimate these parameters using a General Method of Moments methodology."
