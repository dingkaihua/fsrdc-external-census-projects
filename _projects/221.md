abstract: "The purpose of this research is to document the extent of immigrant segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas, explain the formation and dissipation of immigrant ghettos, and examine the implications of residential concentration for immigrants’ socioeconomic and developmental well-being. The project will make use of public-use Census data to compute segregation indices and statistically analyze residential location choices and individual outcomes in 1910. The project will use non-public use Census microdata to perform statistical analysis in 1990, as well as 1980 and 2000 as the data become available. This project will benefit the Census Bureau in two ways. First, the segregation data derived from this effort will complement the Bureau’s own data on residential segregation, which to this point has focused on broad racial categories rather than individual immigrant groups. Second, learning about the dynamic evolution of immigrant enclaves will assist the Bureau in planning for future Census enumerations."
