abstract: "In a sequential mixed-mode survey design, a combination of data collection modes is used sequentially to reduce nonresponse bias and control total survey costs. However, nonrandom mixtures of modes yield unknown bias properties for population estimates such as means and totals. This research project aims to develop statistical inference methods accounting for both nonresponse and nonrandom mode effects. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the most prominent survey that uses such a sequential mixed-mode survey design, and therefore is an important test bed for such empirical evaluations. This research will focus on two variables in particular, personal income and health insurance coverage, which the survey methodology literature suggests are subject to mode effects. The proposed method conceptualizes the sequential mixed-mode survey data as a special case of a missing data problem. The research outcome will be revised ACS microdata that are adjusted for nonresponse and nonrandom mode effects, and corresponding composite weights to compute population estimates from these microdata. Additionally, alternative subgroup allocations for nonresponse follow-up which aim to reduce cost or mean square error will be investigated under the ACS design."
