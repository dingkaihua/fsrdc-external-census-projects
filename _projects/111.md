abstract: "This research project is a continuation of work we have been doing with Census data, beginning in 1991 at the Center for Economic Studies in Suitland, and continuing since 1994 at the Boston Research Data Center.  We started (under the Census Fellows program) by examining the impact of environmental regulation on productivity at the plant level, using LRD data for three industries:  steel, oil, and paper.  Later we considered the impact of environmental regulation on plant location decisions (funded by EPA and NSF).  More recently we have focused specifically on the paper industry, looking at the impact of environmental regulation on investment and the choice of production technology. 	This study uses plant-level data to examine the connection between environmental."
