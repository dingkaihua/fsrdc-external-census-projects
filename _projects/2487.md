abstract: "This project seeks to use data from the AHS to first study the extent to which homes are uninsured across the US and how uninsurance varies by socio-economic and geographic factors. We then aim to use geographic variation in exposure to natural disasters to estimate differences in current and future financial outcomes by whether or not a household is insured.  Finally, we will estimate the extent to which the propensity to purchase homeowners insurance is responsive to price changes by observing pre-and post- natural disasters, and, how that response varies by factors including socioeconomic status, demographics, and geography.  Ultimately, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how market for homeowners insurance could change with increased risks such as climate change and how those changes could pose a burden on the government."
