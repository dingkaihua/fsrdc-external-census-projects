abstract: "This research employs census long form sample and American Community Survey (ACS) confidential data to analyze the dynamics underlying the increasing dispersal of the foreign-born population in the United States. The project focuses on three dimensions of this process: 1) The estimation of the individual and context characteristics that underlie internal migration to nontraditional destinations; 2) The analysis of place and individual characteristics associated with both residential stability and residential churning for foreign-born persons residing in non-traditional destinations; and 3) The examination of the process of selection of destinations for those departing from nontraditional settlement areas. The analysis utilizes McFadden choice models to estimate the role of different destination contexts in attracting foreign born. Multilevel logit models estimate the processes of departure from gateway and nontraditional places. This project will enhance census and ACS data by generating knowledge on cohort residential trajectories between the 1980s and early 2000s. The research on destination choices will also provide a detailed picture of the migration links between specific types of places. In addition to describing the nature of these linkages, the research will shed light on the dynamics underlying emerging trends in the internal migration and settlement behaviors of the growing foreign-born population."
