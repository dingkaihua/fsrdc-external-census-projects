abstract: "While college attainment has been studied extensively in the economics literature, it has become increasingly apparent that there are many post-secondary education decisions - such as major choice, pursuing advanced degrees, and taking on student loan debt - beyond a simple binary college completion choice that are crucial in determining one's earnings and financial stability later in life. By linking young adults in the American Community Surveys and the National Surveys of College Graduates to themselves and their parents in the Decennial Censuses, we propose to study how family background and local economic conditions influence these behavioral margins. We expect that the children of wealthier households are more likely to pursue high-earning majors/degrees while accruing less student loan debt. Individuals may respond to adverse local economic shocks by pursuing more schooling and more generally applicable majors. Substantial heterogeneity in these effects may be present across sex and race. These responses may have important policy implications and will further our understanding of the sources of economic inequality in the United States."
