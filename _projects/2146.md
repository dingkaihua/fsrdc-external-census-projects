abstract: "We propose a research project that evaluates the utility of the American Community Survey (ACS) for measuring and understanding the way changes in local policies affect individuals' residential location choices, work location choices, and the spatial distribution of economic disadvantage. This project will benefit the Census by examining the usefulness of the home-work information available in the ACS for understanding the nature and geographic scope of local labor markets, as well as for tracing out the effects of shocks to those markets. To accomplish this, we will use the restricted use ACS to estimate the outcomes of place-based programs that incentivize investment in specific areas and local minimum wage ordinances. We will compare results using restricted-access ACS information on commutes to commuting patterns observed in the public-use LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data. This comparison will shed light on relative advantages and disadvantages of each dataset in measuring commuting patterns overall, as well as for different subpopulations."
