abstract: "This research examines how employeesâ€™ tolerance for risk affects corporate decisions and firm performance, including firm debt, capital expenditures, patents, acquisitions, returns on assets and equity, firm age, and public/private status. Proxies for employee risk-tolerance include firm-level measures of employee age and gender, percentage of employees with earnings sources from other companies, percentage of employees with dual wage earners in their household, and county-level measures of religiosity. This project also examines a firm's ownership status, i.e., public or private, and the demographic characteristics of the firm's employees. "
