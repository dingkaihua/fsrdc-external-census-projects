abstract: "We propose to construct instrumental variables estimates of the effects of education and veteran status on average earnings, wage inequality, and a number of noneconomic outcomes. The empirical strategy relies on instrumental variables constructed from data on date and place of birth, derived from the 1990 and 2000 census long forms, as well as college proximity and college costs, derived from the National Longitudinal Survey Original Cohort geocode. Our project benefits the U.S. Census Bureau by using social security data to improve the imputation of a pre-1990 variable on highest grade completed from post-1990 categorical schooling variables and by establishing a procedure for matching the 1990 to 2000 censuses."
