abstract: "This project focuses on the determinants and consequences of Great Society era programs, which were both local in nature and interacted with local economic, social, and demographic conditions. This project requests the use of Protected Information Keys (PIKs) to link the NUMIDENT and LEHD files to the 1940 and 2000 Decennial Censuses and 1996-2024 American Community Surveys. This PIK-linkage allows us to study both how public policies originating in the Great Society era respond to economic conditions and disparities as well as how these disparities and policies have affected long-term population outcomes and population dynamics."
