abstract: "There is a rich literature examining the factors associated with help-seeking behaviors among victims of crime. However, the ability to draw conclusions from this body of research is hampered by small, highly selective (biased)  samples of victims and/or a limited focus on incident and individual-level factors. One implication is a dearth of information on the general and specific effects of socio-cultural factors that likely influence reporting behaviors among victims of violent crimes. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) contains a nationally representative sample of persons ages 12 and over and has the potential to overcome prior limitations by examining whether victims of intimate partner and sexual violence engage in two types of formal help-seeking behavior: reporting and accessing victim services. In addition to detailed information on incident and victim characteristics, the NCVS also contains geographic identifiers that enable a researcher to link incident-level and individual-level information with contextual factors such as proactive justice policies, resource availability, and community attitudes, in order to estimate how socio-cultural factors influence the help seeking pathways of victims of intimate partner and sexual assault."
