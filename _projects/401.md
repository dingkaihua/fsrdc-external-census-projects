abstract: "While most discussions of immigrant assimilation focus on labor and housing markets, immigrant participation in financial markets is a critical and largely unstudied dimension of economic assimilation.  The degree to which immigrants assimilate into the financial mainstream has profound implications for the U.S. economy. This project will provide new evidence on the extent of immigrant participation in financial markets and the key determinants of financial assimilation. The aspects of financial assimilation that will be studied include use of checking and savings accounts, participation in the stock market, and investment in risky vs. “safe” assets. The analysis will be based on data from the Survey of Income Program and Participation (SIPP). These data will be supplemented with characteristics of the countries of origin and with data on the destination communities. The predominant purpose of this project is to benefit the U.S. Census Bureau’s program, and it will do so in at least three ways. First, this study will com-pare SIPP data on immigrant year of arrival and country of origin to comparable data from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. Second, this study will analyze the factors that account for the higher attrition rate of immigrants relative to the native born in the SIPP panel. Finally, the project will produce population estimates of the pace of immigrant financial assimilation."
