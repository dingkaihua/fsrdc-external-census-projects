abstract: "We investigate the impact of SNAP generosity on adult nutrition, health, and food insecurity using a methodology that leverages the local variation in food prices across geographic market groups. The project includes two components. First, we extend previous validation studies on the Current Population Survey (CPS) to investigate the extent and determinants of misreporting in SNAP participation using state administrative data, including more states and years. Second, we investigate the impact of SNAP purchasing power on food insecurity for recipients, extending previous studies along dimensions of data availability and the sensitivity of findings to misreported participation. To do so, we calculate the SNAP purchasing power using regional food prices from the Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database available for 2001-2010. The project advances the literature on the quality of participation measures and the implications for food insecurity analysis."
