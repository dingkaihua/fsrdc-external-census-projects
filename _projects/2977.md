abstract: "This project examines the spatial distribution of job growth within firms to understand how city characteristics affect firms' opportunities. The advantage of our approach is that we can control for firm fixed effects such that we can disentangle potential shared fortunes of cities and the firms that operate there. We first map how the city-specific component of labor productivity affects employment growth. We then document how the educational characteristics of the labor market, housing costs, commercial rents, population density, and city population affect the city-specific component of a firm's labor market productivity growth."
