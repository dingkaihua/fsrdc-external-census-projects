abstract: "This project will generate new information on rigidities in the labor market for older workers by using rich longitudinal survey data on individuals matched to employment data on the firms that employ them. The individual data are from the Survey of Program Participation and the employer data are from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics files. The aims of this project are to address the following issues: (1) What accounts for differences in the age structure of employment across firms? Why do some firms employ a larger proportion of older workers than others, and why do some firms hire a larger share of older workers than others? Do differences in the age structure of employment across firms indicate the existence of labor market rigidities? (2) How does the age composition of employment and hiring in a firm affect hours worked and the rate of exit from the firm of older workers relative to younger workers, both to other firms and to nonemployment, controlling for the effects of worker characteristics? (3) What are the main factors responsible for rigidity in the labor market and its differential effects on older relative to younger workers? The main alter-native explanations that can be analyzed with matched worker-firm data are technology-basedâ€”fixed costs of hiring, training, and employment; team production considerations; costly monitoring of worker effort; and firm-specific human capital. These explanations can be studied with matched worker-firm data because technology is firm specific, even within industries. The project will address these questions by estimating regressions models explaining labor market transitions of workers as a function of the age distribution of employment in their firms, con-trolling for worker characteristics. The project will also estimate structural equilibrium models of the labor market intended to explain variation in the age structure of employment across firms."
