abstract: "This project seeks to characterize the impact of trade on consumption, earnings and inequality in the United States. On consumption, we aim to use detailed micro-data to measure which consumers buy imported products or domestic products that use imported intermediate inputs, by building a new bridge between the Census data and product-level consumption data from the Nielsen Company. On earnings, we propose to comprehensively measure the exposure of U.S. workers to various facets of international trade, namely import competition, export opportunities, and the use of imported intermediate inputs using the Census' surveys of firms and customs data. On inequality, we use a model to infer the distributional consequences of trade via consumption and earnings from the empirical patterns observed in the data. The project relies on several Census datasets: SSL and LBD to match external consumption data to firm microdata; Economic Census (for both manufacturing and other sectors), Annual Surveys, and LFTTD to measure firms' exposure to international trade; LEHD to measure worker exposure to trade; and finally CFS, SIRD, and BRDIS to understand the role of geography of sales and innovation in how U.S. consumers benefit from trade."
