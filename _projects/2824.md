abstract: "This research project applies the unleashed modeling capabilities and statistical inference for large-scale network models to the Longitudinal Employer and Household Dynamics (LEHD). Our central research question regards the impact of immigration on the macro, likely segmented, structure of the U.S. labor market and workers' labor market outcome inequality over the last two decades. Methodologically, the team is developing further the latent position graph modeling - extending from static graph modeling to dynamic graph modeling. Asymptotic spectral theory and computationally efficient procedures for understanding massive bipartite networks are also being developed. The empirical application to the LEHD will extend methods from the usual one-mode network setting (such as social media networks) to the bipartite network setting (such as worker-employer affiliation networks). We propose data combination methods to solve the problem in a lack of critical information on hours worked in the LEHD and to augment the SIPP survey data with the estimated individual memberships in the clusters of workers' latent positions in the labor market space. Our theoretical and empirical analyses will be complemented by the development and dissemination of open source software that implements the tractable, scalable and computationally efficient methods in analyzing large-scale social and economic networks."
