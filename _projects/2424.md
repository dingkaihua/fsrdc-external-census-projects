abstract: "What were the main drivers of female labor force participation during World War II? Were there long-term consequences for women who entered the workforce and for their children? In order to address these questions, I make use of the Census Numident File combined with the 1940 Census to construct a novel intercensal measure of labor force entry--SSN first issuance--for the wives of draft-eligible men. After linking these data to the WWII Enlistment Records, I exploit the draft lottery to construct an individual-level instrument for married women's workforce entry. In doing so, I can disentangle the supply and demand-side drivers of female labor supply during WWII--the former being proxied by government spending by town--conditional on a rich set of covariates. Furthermore, I plan to leverage the longitudinal structure of PIK-ed mandatory surveys to assess the long-term consequences of female entry. Specifically, by using reduced form evidence and instrumental variable techniques, I intend to assess whether being a working woman increased the likelihood of divorce and whether the outcomes of children of working mothers differed substantially from those of non-working mothers. In order to address identification concerns, I plan to extend the analysis to elicit random variation in the entry of female neighbors. Preliminary results suggest that a man's draft status (and timing) strongly predicts his wife's labor force entry: by accessing RDC data I wish to evaluate whether women paid a social cost for working and if their children benefited from having a working mother."
