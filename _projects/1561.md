abstract: "This research seeks to investigate the relationship between longitudinal establishment-level characteristics and plant-level skill demands in the U.S. manufacturing industry as well as two additional occupations in the IT and healthcare industriesâ€”computer support specialists and laboratory technologists. What establishment characteristics predict high-skill demands and/or skill-related hiring difficulties? Although the issue of skills receives considerable attention in debates related to economic growth, unemployment, and income inequality, the existing literature rarely measures skills directly, instead relying on rough proxies for skill. Even in cases where more precise measures of skill are available, these measures are rarely linked to firm- or establishment-level data. We seek to address these limitations by linking manufacturing datasets from the Census Bureau with an external data that contains detailed measurements of manufacturing establishment-level skill demands. More specifically, we will link the 2012 MIT Production in the Innovation Economy (PIE) Manufacturing Survey to the Longitudinal Business Database, Annual Survey of Manufactures, including the Management and Organizational Practices Survey, Census of Manufactures, and National Employer Survey. The link will occur both at the establishment- and firm-level. In addition, we will link the 2015 Computer Support Specialist/IT Helpdesk National Skills Survey and Laboratory Technologist National Skills Survey (IT and healthcare industry equivalent survey to the PIE survey) to the Census of Services and Services Annual Survey, among others."
