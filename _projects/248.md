abstract: "It is hypothesized that continuous measurement of transportation variables such as work trip mode and  journey-to-work time is subject to seasonal effects.  The data examined here is in the county including Springfield, Massachusetts.  This metropolitan area is the second largest in New England and includes the region's second largest transit system.  This research will look at seasonal differences in transportation-related data, consider their significance, and consider the impact on using the new data for transportation planning.  Project results will include statistical tests of the seasonality  hypotheses, monthly tabulations of transportation-related data, and advantages and disadvantages to collecting data continuously for transportation planning applications."
