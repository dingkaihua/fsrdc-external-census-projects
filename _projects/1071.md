abstract: "This project will use confidential microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) to provide an efficient framework for carrying out small area estimation (SAE), while preserving geographical and temporal constraints that arise from the surveyâ€™s aggregate structure. Further, by borrowing strength across multiple scales in space and time, and multiple outcomes, the proposed approach will reduce the variance in the ACS small area estimates and its derivatives. Additionally, from a data users perspective, methodology will be developed that will simultaneously provide coherent estimates on several temporal scales, rather than being hampered by the published multiyear estimates. Importantly, this will allow researchers to compare trends across different geographies. 
The proposed methods are of independent interest and can be used in many of the other surveys administered by US Census Bureau (and other Federal Statistics Agencies). For example, straightforward modification of the proposed methods can be used in conjunction with the Current Population Survey, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Agricultural Resource Management Survey, among others. Furthermore, several of the proposed methods (SAE) will directly carry over to the area of disease mapping and thus, provide important tools for public health. In short, the proposed methods provide novel solutions across a wide-range of applied problems, contributing to the statistics literature, Federal, State and Local governments and many subject matter disciplines.
