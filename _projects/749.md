abstract: "This research project aims to improve the quality of U.S. Census Bureau data and to increase knowledge about the determinants of manufacturing establishment performance. These objectives will be accomplished by linking an external dataset of establishments receiving business assistance between 1999 and 2007 to census datasets. The project uses the external dataset of business assistance recipients to both validate and improve the quality of census data. The data will be used to identify limitations of the census sampling frame, measure data quality, estimate nonresponse bias, and improve imputations for nonresponse in census datasets. The business assistance dataset is valuable because it contains data at the same level of resolution and contains some of the same data elements as census datasets. The project uses the linked datasets to explore determinants of establishment productivity not currently measured in census datasets. Specifically, the research explores how manufacturing establishment performance is affected by business assistance and how the effects vary across measurable dimensions. The analysis focuses on business assistance provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s Manufacturing Extension Partnership between 1999 and 2007. The project employs a variety of econometric approaches, primarily relying on an instrumental variables approach to estimate how measures of establishment performance such as productivity, output, and employment growth are affected by different types and levels of business assistance. Access to the census datasets is required to provide a valid control group and to provide key performance and control variables for this analysis."
