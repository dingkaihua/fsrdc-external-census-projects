abstract: "Academic disciplines play an important role in establishing methods for studying phenomena observed in the real world; however, there is a significant push from institutions, such as universities and grant funding agencies, for researchers to work with others outside of their disciplinary silos. Our objective is to study how the PhD market responds to this movement through a unique juxtaposition of datasets including UMETRICS, SED, and LEHD. This project will extend the prior literature on the near-term labor market penalty interdisciplinary dissertators in STEM fields tend to face in the first year after completing the PhD.  This project will also generate novel population estimates by addressing the following five Research Questions (RQs): RQ1: To what extent do interdisciplinary dissertators tend to face either penalties, rewards, more varied outcomes, or no differences in outcomes over the course of their careers (after completing an interdisciplinary dissertation)? RQ2: To what extent do the patterns that we examine through RQ1 vary over time? RQ3: How do graduate students who are funded by programs with an interdisciplinary focus do over the course of their careers when compared with graduate students funded by the NSF in similar but more traditional discipline-based programs? RQ4: How do members of (large) project-based teams do over the course of their careers when compared with peers who are not part of (large) project-based teams? RQ5:To what extent do the SED and ProQuest datasets correspond to each other with respect to classifying someone's dissertation as interdisciplinary?"
