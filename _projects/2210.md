abstract: "This project investigates the sources of rising firm heterogeneity in the U.S economy.  We explore three distinctive forces behind this trend: technological change and innovation activities, frictions in the labor and capital input market, and distortions in the output market such as firms' strategic scale, scope, or pricing decisions. Uncovering the importance of these forces has important implications for allocative efficiency, aggregate TFP, and welfare of the economy. We pay specific attention to firms that operate multi-unit establishments, produce multi-products, and/or are active in a large number of geographic markets. In this way, our project refines the existing studies by conducting measurement and analysis over time, across space, and within the firm. "
