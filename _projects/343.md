abstract: "Modal choice of product shipments has changed in the last 20 years. This has implications for the shipping sector, transportation patterns, energy use, and pollution. This project examines the detailed data from the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) linked to the LRD to estimate a model of mode choice. The National Energy Modeling system (NEMS) uses freight mode choice to forecast energy use in this sector, but is based on fixed shares from the 1977 CFS. The aggregate data show large shift in mode with higher value products are more likely to use premium shipment modes, like air freight. However, the aggregate data is insufficient to estimate the combined effects of shipper and shipment specific effects that the linked CFS and LRD can provide. This project estimates the industry and product specific determinants of this underlying economic choice that can be used in NEMS to improve its forecasting capability. The benefits to Census include linkages across entities in the CFS and LRD that may lead to a harmonization of the commodity definitions, quality estimates of the CFS value of shipments estimates, additional population characteristics on transportation mode choice and better imputation for non-response."
