abstract: " 
Collected under Title 13, Chapter 5, of the U.S. Code, the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Manufacturing Energy Consumption survey all contain important information about plant-level activity in the United States and associated material and energy use. Over the past decade, voluntary environmental programs have played an increasingly important role in environmental and energy management. Yet existing programs have been subject to only limited empirical study. An important question is whether participation in these programs is important enough to warrant inclusion in future surveys, analogous to current questions about energy management. 
This project will increase the knowledge base of the U.S. Census Bureau and other researchers and analysts by merging existing data with additional information on emissions and voluntary program participation. First, this project will allow us to examine the impact of voluntary program participation and whether it warrants inclusion in future surveys. Second, the project improves our understanding of plant characteristics and activities while checking the quality of existing data. Third, the merged datasets will allow us to calculate population estimates of emissions and other measures of plant activity with and without the voluntary programs. 
All three results promise important benefits for the Census Bureau in its effort to improve the quality and usefulness of both existing Title 13, Chapter 5 data, as well as future survey instruments. Understanding how program participation interacts with other inputs and outputs can indicate whether participation indicators would be useful in future data collection. Comparisons with newly merged datasets allow for verification of some data elements. Even where direct comparisons are not possible, we can observe anomalies in indirect comparisons (for example, energy use and emissions) that signal a quality issue. As we compute population estimates of plant emissions and activity with and without voluntary programs, we will make use of state-of-the-art sample selection techniques. Such techniques, which are analogous to missing data techniques, could prove useful in other areas of work with Census Bureau data where population estimates are necessary despite significant problems with missing data. Finally, we expect this work to generate suggestions for improved survey design in the future. 
The last result will provide some of the first quantified estimates of voluntary program consequences involving careful attention to sample selection issues. Drawing on experience with EPA’s 33/50 and Climate Wise programs, and DOE’s 1605(b) program, the proposed research will identify program consequences based on competing sample selection approaches that jointly model voluntary program participation and emission outcome. The assumptions inherent in these competing models can alter or reverse estimated population effects. Comparing estimates across models and programs, we expect to draw conclusions that will be more robust and therefore more valuable for future decision-making. "
