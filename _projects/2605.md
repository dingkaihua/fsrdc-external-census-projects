abstract: "Taxes on business property are a key source of revenue for local governments in the US, yet little is known about how these taxes affect economic activity. This project exploits large historical changes in tax legislation and regional institutional features of tax assessment in order to obtain shifts in taxation that are uncorrelated with business conditions. In conjunction with microdata on establishment-level outcomes from the U.S. Census Bureau, this variation will yield estimates of a range of business responses to taxes, including changes to wages, employment, revenue, prices, and location decisions. The central empirical design relies on merging an external dataset, comprised of publicly available regional property and transfer tax rates and parcel-level property records, to multiple U.S. Census Bureau datasets, including the County Business Patterns Business Register, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the Economic Census. This linkage will permit estimation of establishment-level event-study models as well as comparisons between Census records and the external data. This study will yield the first rigorous empirical estimates of responses to taxes on business property. These estimates are key for understanding the economic incidence of a funding source which, at $500 billion, represents approximately one-third of aggregate state and local tax revenue."
