abstract: "Kain’s classic paper on spatial mismatch argued that residential segregation reduces the equilibrium employment of minorities by increasing the distance to available jobs. While a substantial literature has emerged testing this hypothesis, and the more general notion that one’s distance to potential jobs might reduce employment probabilities, few studies have been able to deal adequately with the endogeneity of firm and worker location decisions. This project uses a natural experiment to infer the wage and employment effects of moving employers closer to an underemployed population. Using the federal Empowerment Zone program as an exogenous predictor of firm location, the project develops an instrumental variables approach to estimating the elasticity of labor supply with respect to job availability. The analysis will utilize data from the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses, the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SSEL), and the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD)."
