abstract: "This project studies the effect of volatility shocks on worker reallocation through the financial channel. When the volatility of firm-level productivity increases, firms are more likely to go bankrupt because of the higher likelihood of bad shocks, especially for firms with higher leverage. Since workers bear losses after their firms' bankruptcy, highly leveraged firms need to pay higher wages as compensation and hire less. Consequently, a positive volatility shock generates worker outflows from highly leveraged firms to lowly leveraged firms, amplifying the recession. We will use Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data which provides information on firms' employment, workers' earnings, and job transitions. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) supplements the LEHD files for more information on employment and other employer characteristics. We also prepare external data to supplement firms' financial information, including Compustat and the firm default probabilities calculated from the CRSP Daily Stock dataset. Compustat/CRSP will be linked to the County Business Patterns â€“ Business Register (CBPBR) using the Compustat-SSEL Bridge (CSB). CBPBR also provides internal identifiers to link to LEHD and LBD. Our main empirical tools are multivariate regressions for panel data with fixed effects. We will conduct our empirical analyses at the individual-level (worker-level and firm-level) and worker-firm-level (job-level) to analyze the impact of volatility shocks on firms' employment decisions and default probabilities, workers' earnings, and job transition probabilities conditional on firms' leverage. We expect to find that when volatility increases, highly leveraged firms are associated with higher default risks, higher wages, lower employment, and higher separation probabilities."
