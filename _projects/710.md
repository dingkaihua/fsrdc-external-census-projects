abstract: "Wage inequality has increased rapidly in the US since the late 1970s. Imports to the US, especially those from low-wage developing economies, have risen over the same period. Standard trade theory links these trends and provides one explanation for the rise in relative wages of more skilled workers. However, most empirical studies have failed to find a strong connection between  trade and wage inequality. Most of these studies use unreliable proxies for skill and ignore related characteristics of workers and businesses that influence wages. We remedy these failings with matched employer-employee micro-data. Federal trade data are employed to identify imports by state and to explore how import competition impacts wage inequality across US regions."
