abstract: "The blooming of e-commerce over the past decade has fostered a considerable diversity and complexity of structure, applications, and definitions. This project examines and evaluates the adoption and use of e-commerce across a diverse set of manufacturing firms.  It examines the Computer Network Use Supplement data on e-commerce gathered in the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) and analyzes the characteristics of firms that are related to the use of e-commerce. The focus is on manufacturing because it is currently the sector in which e-commerce is most widely adopted.  The project examines the implementation of e-commerce across manufacturing industries and product types and focuses on how it con-tributes to firms’ competitive advantage through changes in value chains. The analysis is set in the context of how the material characteristics of firms (ranging from size to ability to adopt innovation) impact their medium to long-term viability. While this analysis masks the complex ways in which e-commerce is put to work by firms, this focus on the firm and firm-level characteristics is a first step in uncovering the larger changes at the firm and regional level engendered by e-commerce. This project will also inform the Census Bureau about the quality of the e-commerce data collected using the ASM, about new methods for collecting this type of data, and about the characteristics of firms that influence the probability that and the degree to which a firm will use e-commerce. The Census Bureau would then be able to use this information to further assess the quality of data reported as well as be able to update cur-rent methods for imputing missing data."
