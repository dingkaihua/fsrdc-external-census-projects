abstract: "Our proposed project is an extension of ongoing research on job creation and destruction in U.S. manufacturing summarized in Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996).  A central finding of this research is the prominent role of job destruction in business cycle fluctuations.  Specifically, job destruction increases sharply and regularly in recessions, but job creation typically declines much less and by varying amounts across recessions.  Together, these features imply that job reallocation rises significantly during recessions. 
	Although the Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (DHS) results provide a fascinating look at what happens to job destruction -- i.e., how large it is, how much it varies, how long it lasts, in which kind of plants it occurs, etc. -- very little is known yet about why job destruction happens.  Thus, the goal of this research proposal is to discover what causes job destruction and, in doing so, delineate the causes from the consequences of  job destruction.  Initially, this research will follow the tradition of DHS, which is a largely descriptive empirical analysis of the data.  Later, we expect to introduce and estimate formal econometric models."
