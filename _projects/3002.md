abstract: "A central goal of criminal justice reform initiatives is to reduce the number of people whose lives are altered by the justice system, often by reducing justice system involvement. The majority of policies that work to this end - for example: diversion efforts or sentencing reform - focus on interventions within the system itself. Such policies the fail to address the root causes, structural inequalities, and institutional contexts that lead to criminal justice system involvement in the first place. Poverty is a significant root cause of criminal justice system interaction and growing up in poverty is directly associated with a host of risk factors for justice system involvement. This research explores how the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a safety net benefit that has been associated with substantial declines in childhood poverty rates, might protect an individual from the life-changing negative consequences of the justice system in adulthood. It investigates the questions: Do policies that reduce childhood poverty prevent subsequent involvement in the criminal justice system? For whom might such policies prevent involvement, by how much, and what crimes might be affected?

The analysis will take two approaches to exploring the value of EITC as an early intervention. The first will exploit state-level generosity in supplemental EITC benefits to estimate the impact of high-level policy variation on all children. The second will focus on children in EITC beneficiary households and, similarly, exploit variation in state EITC policy to estimate the effects of marginal increases in benefits. Both analyses will utilize childhood data from the Current Population Survey - Annual Social and Economic Supplement data (CPS-ASEC) linked with adult criminal justice outcomes from The Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). Analyses will explore heterogeneous effects by race in order to identify for whom the EITC might mitigate the consequences of childhood poverty on criminal justice system interaction and how that might impact racial disparity in the justice system, as well as effects by gender and age cohort to explore how benefits or information campaigns can be best targeted. The final scholarly product will be a dissertation and a journal article. As governments consider the critical goal of criminal justice system reform, this research can offer insight into a social policy, rather than a justice system policy, that targets a root cause of criminal justice system interaction and that could provide a policy lever to reduce inequality."
