abstract: "The proposed analysis takes two avenues by studying: (1) The industry and geographic heterogeneity in the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Research Database, and (2) the sources of productivity growth for outsourcing organizations. For researching industry and geographic variation, economic concentration indexes and Locational Gini coefficients will be estimated for different geographic and industry measures. Economic concentration indexes and Locational Ginis provide a statistical measure of the geographic and industrial agglomeration of outsourcing. In addition, plant and firm intermediate input demand is estimated as a function of domestic variables in order to determine the importance of the different factors that drive an organization’s decision to outsource. In particular, estimated demand functions calculate the importance of domestic wages, trade costs, regulation, and technology in the context of the decision to outsource. The derived demand estimation is verified through a probit analysis of the determinants of an organization’s decision to outsource. The second avenue of research, the productivity analysis, entails estimating differences in exit rates and decomposing productivity growth between outsourcing and non-outsourcing organizations. Estimates will be provided from various specifications that capture the factors important in the agglomeration and productivity growth of outsourcing within the United States."
