abstract: "We study how U.S. importers select their foreign input suppliers and, in particular, how this choice is affected by risk. To this end, we use data from the Longitudinal Foreign Trade Transactions Database, the Longitudinal Business Database, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, and the Census of Manufactures. First, we document the distribution of the number of foreign suppliers within narrowly defined products to show that top importers typically source their products from multiple suppliers. Next, we explore whether this pattern of supplier diversification can be linked to different sources of risk, including the uncertainty stemming from the supplierâ€™s location and contractual problems that may lead to hold-up. We plan to build a theoretical model of supplier choice under uncertainty and estimate it with the microdata. We will then study how counterfactual shocks, such as an increase in uncertainty in a source country, can affect aggregate trade flows and the overall volatility of the U.S. economy. "
