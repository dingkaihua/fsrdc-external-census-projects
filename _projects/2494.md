abstract: "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been in effect since the 1970s. Although there exists a body of research examining the short-term effects of WIC on participating children, little is still known about whether any short-term effects persist through adulthood. In this project, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation across time and space in WIC geographical roll-out in the 1970s to study the causal effects of the program on children's longer-term outcomes such as high school graduation, college enrollment and completion, and earnings. In particular, we estimate the average intend-to-treat effect of exposure to WIC that lasts for different periods of time and starts at different times during one's childhood, such as in-utero, in the first year of life or later, in the third-fifth year of life, etc. For this purpose, we combine data on adult outcomes of children born in the 1970s from the American Community Survey and 2000 Decennial with our data on WIC timing and geographical spread across counties and use a difference-in-differences research design. We utilize the Numident to link respondents to the WIC roll-out data based on date and place of birth. Our findings will reveal whether enrollment in WIC in childhood raises, on average, the probability of graduating from high school, enrolling in college, completing college, and having higher earnings in adulthood."
