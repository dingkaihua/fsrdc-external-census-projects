abstract: "This project will investigate how internal corporate gover­nance, measured by the quality of headquarters’ monitoring of individual plants, affects plant productivity and other plant-level attributes. The plant-level data used in this project are obtained from the Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Longitudinal Business Database. The researchers will develop two measures of internal corporate governance. The first measure is the distance (physical distance or traveling time) between headquarters and individual plants. The second measure for the quality of monitoring is the “industry closeness” between the plant and headquarters. This measure reflects the idea that headquarters understands better, and thus finds it easier to monitor, a plant that operates in an industry with which headquarters is familiar. Plant productivity will be measured by total factor productiv­ity, operating margin, and labor productivity. Three main types of regressions will be estimated. The first type of regression looks at the direct (cross-sectional) relationship between productivity and internal corporate governance. The second type of regression examines whether the productivity gains (or losses) after a change of ownership can be explained by the difference in internal cor­porate governance. The third type of regression investigates if and how internal corporate governance amplifies (or mitigates) plant-level productivity shocks (state labor laws, natural disasters, oil and electricity shocks, opening of airports and golf courses in a neighborhood of the plant). Finally, plant-level measures of internal corporate governance will be aggregated into firm-level measures of internal corporate governance (e.g., the “weighted average distance” between headquarters and the firm’s plants) that can be used to investigate the role of internal corporate governance at the firm level (e.g., for equity prices or the conglomerate discount)."
