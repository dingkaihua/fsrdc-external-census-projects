abstract: "This project will analyze the role credit availability plays in the development and growth of veteran-owned businesses over time and across space. Based on past research, we expect the performance of veteran-owned firms to be affected by the availability of credit for these ventures (either start-up capital or expansion capital). To better understand the effects of access to credit on veteran-owned businesses, the researchers will build on their past research, which identified local financial institutions to examine the impact different types of lenders in a geographic region have on small and young businesses. Care will be taken to identify more specifically those financial industries that are often coded in miscellaneous industry categories. The researchers have developed computer programs that parse names, abbreviations, and acronyms for information that may suggest a more specific classification. As part of our investigation, we will examine how survival and employment growth in military veteran owned businesses vary across disability status, gender, race, and rurality. The researchers propose to advance the scholarly understanding of military veteran business location and growth process and the effects of military veteran businesses on local economic performance in the United States"
