abstract: "We propose to address two major limitations of existing Census Bureau data products. First, the restricted-access 1990 and 2000 census microdata lack precise geographic coordinates for the residences of respondents. This limitation prevents Census analysts and others from conducting high-precision spatial analysis and modeling with 1990 and 2000 data. The second major limitation to be addressed is the problem of inconsistencies across time in the summarized geographic units in public census summary data. Where the extents of geographic units change between censuses, it can be impossible to determine how the units' populations have changed. To address this problem, several secondary data providers have produced geographically standardized census data series, which give estimates of population and housing characteristics across multiple census years for a single, fixed set of geographic units. The rapidly growing use of these products is concerning because errors in standardized data are potentially severe, but the real magnitude of errors remains undetermined. 
We would use restricted census microdata to address these issues in three ways. First, we will geocode all 1990 and 2000 census responses as nearly as possible to the standards of the current Master Address File. This will dramatically increase the quality and usefulness of restricted-access census microdata for these years. Second, for every 1990 and 2000 census response, we will identify the 2010 and 2020 census block of residence, enabling the production of high-accuracy geographically standardized time series within restricted environments. Third, we will summarize the accuracy of public sources of geographically standardized census tract data, establishing a foundational guideline on the fitness for use of publicly available standardized data products and demonstrating the relative merits of the different standardization approaches each product uses."
