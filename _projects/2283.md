abstract: "The proposed study uses the National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS) to investigate intimate partner violence victims' use of healthcare facilities and state-specific correlates associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) rates. We seek to increase the utility of Census Bureau data by analyzing the effects of healthcare access, income, employment, family, race, gender, and state-level characteristics on IPV rates and victims' healthcare facility utilization. We are particularly interested in whether state differences in healthcare professionals' reporting requirements explain meaningful variation in victims' likelihood of seeking professional medical services and overall rates of IPV victimization and reporting. Some argue that mandatory reporting is beneficial in that it helps law enforcement officers identify abusers and forces abusers to face the seriousness of their actions (Coulter & Chez, 1997). Others say mandatory reporting discourages victims from seeking medical help and robs them of their autonomy for safely reporting abuse, often putting victims further in harm's way. Many scholars (Sullivan & Hagen, 2005; Rodriguez et al., 2001; Glass et al., 2001; Gielen et al., 2000) have qualitatively studied patients' and healthcare workers' perceptions of mandatory reporting policies and found that most patients who have experienced IPV oppose these regulations. However, to our knowledge, this would be the first study that quantitatively examines the actual impacts of mandatory physician reporting laws on healthcare utilization rates of IPV victims using a quasi-experimental framework. In light of this debate, our central research questions are: (1) Do healthcare providers' mandatory reporting requirements impact the use of healthcare services for victims of IPV? And (2), do states with mandatory reporting requirements have more or less IPV per capita? In answering these questions we will also examine how police presence, proximity to care providers, local economic climate, family size, race, and gender impact the likelihood of experiencing IPV and seeking healthcare after an IPV incident. To answer these questions, we will make use of the restricted NCVS to obtain greater geographic precision about the counties and states that respondents reside in. We will prepare estimates of victim's healthcare utilization rates and IPV rates by state in light of variance in mandatory reporting laws. This will shed light on the costs and benefits of mandatory reporting and will provide a clearer insight into factors which determine healthcare utilization by IPV victims and state-level differences in IPV rates. Through our analysis of the data, we will also document the distribution of missing data related to IPV and how this missing data is related to the method of data collection to help increase the utility of the data to the Census Bureau.
There may be some concern about victimization generally, and IPV especially, constituting a sensitive topic of research. This concern is fair, though the NCVS is designed specifically to generate population estimates of victimization prevalence and the associated characteristics of victimized individuals. The present research falls within this purpose, and therefore represents a fairly routine use of these data. While we do plan to use these estimates to determine how state-level policies on mandatory reporting influence IPV reporting and medical care utilization, we are not assessing the impacts of any national policy issues or particularly current, sensitive political topics."
