abstract: "This research explores the effect of a change in input price, in particular, the wage cost, on firmsâ€™ input ratios, profitability, and pricing strategy. Economic theory predicts that when the wage costs decrease, firms will substitute away from capital to hire more labor. Moreover, depending on the competitiveness of the market, a change in the input price can affect the output price and the profitability of firms. This project will produce empirical estimates of these effects. In particular: How does the change in wage cost affect the capital-labor ratio in production? Do firms benefit (profit) from a reduction in wage cost? Or do profits decrease and wages rise? Do firms respond to the increase or decrease in wages in a symmetrical way? Does the change in wages pass-through to the output prices? "
