abstract: "The predominant purpose of this research is to benefit the US Census Bureau by presenting updated statistics on employment, marriage and cohabitating patterns, labor force participation, and uptake of public assistance in response to a layoff at the household level. In conjunction with our primary analysis, we also examine unit non-response to the CPS-ASEC after a layoff event and create a crosswalk that links marital status to the LEHD for multiple years. To accomplish this goal, we request the use of restricted data from three datasets, each of which we propose to link separately to the LEHD. These datasets are: (1) the Decennial Census, 2000 and 2010, and 2020 if available, (2) the American Community Survey (ACS), 2008–2015 and 2016-2019 if available, and (3) the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, 1985-2014, and 2015-2019 if available.
One of the goals of this project is to provide a detailed picture of the insurance role of the family. We plan to answer the following questions: 
• What is the effect of worker displacement on the long-run employment and earnings paths of family members, including spouses and adult children? 
• What are the relative roles of family members and public transfer programs over time in recovering the earnings losses of displaced workers? 
• Does worker displacement affect family structure, such as the likelihood of divorce or separation? How does a cohabiting individual differ in their responses to a displacement compared to a married individual? 
These questions are critical for understanding demographic and employment trends in the U.S., such as the decline of male labor force participation. The proposal will produce updated estimates of the effects of worker displacement on families. It will generate statistical estimates of several outcomes of interest: (i) long-run employment and earnings of family members, (ii) usage of public transfer programs, and (iii) family ruptures (such as separation or divorce).
A final and significant contribution of our research is to study how unemployment affects family structure, including the likelihood of separation or divorce, or the likelihood of marriage for non-married individuals. In the last half-century, the U.S. has experienced dramatic changes in family structure, including the rise of cohabiting couples and non-married couples with children.  Do cohabiting partners behave similarly to married partners in providing an insurance role in their labor supply decisions? The answer to this question is important for assessing the generosity of public assistance programs in the modern era of complex family arrangements. Prior work has found that job loss significantly raises the probability of divorce (Charles et al., 2004). Our proposed research will extend this analysis to study longer time horizons, and with an arguably improved identification strategy; in addition, we will include an analysis of cohabiting individuals to get a more complete picture of the dynamics of family structure in relation to unemployment."
