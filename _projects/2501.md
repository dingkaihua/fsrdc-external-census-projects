abstract: "This project studies the effects of social network on workers' labor market decisions and other outcomes. We will investigate if a worker's job trajectory and earnings are affected by the network of both coworkers and neighbors and if so, assess the magnitude of the network effect. We will also examine the channels of effects by looking at the demographic characteristics, occupation, industry, and income of the workers and the place they work and live. Our empirical strategies to identify the causal effects rely on the access to the workplace and neighborhood data available through the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), American Community Survey (ACS), Master Address File Auxiliary Reference File (MAFARF), Master Address File Extract (MAFX) and Decennial Census from 2000-2020. We will focus on the employees at single-establishment firms to construct network at workplace. The proposed research will shed light on the existence, magnitude and relative importance of both workplace and neighbor network, and contribute to the literature on the implications on labor market inequality."
