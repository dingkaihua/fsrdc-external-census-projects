abstract: "The degree of heterogeneity among pollution sources in their marginal costs of pollution abatement may be the single most important factor affecting the relative cost of economic incentive-based versus other approaches to achieving environmental performance.  We will develop econometrically estimable, structural models of plant-level pollution abatement costs that explicitly allow for significant heterogeneity.  After estimating these models using Census data, they will first assess the degree and sources of cost heterogeneity, and then use simulations to measure the potential gains from using economic incentives relative to other regulatory approaches."
