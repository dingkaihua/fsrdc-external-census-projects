abstract: "It is widely recognized that as the knowledge sectors of the economy have grown, intangible assets have become more central to measuring economic activity and important steps have been taken to estimate those assets. This project will explore multiple measures of intangibles--advertising, R&D, patents, software expenses, and capitalized software investment--to validate these measures, to understand how these investments are distributed across the population of firms and establishments, to measure firm or establishment productivity including intangible capital stocks, and to analyze how intangibles affect the relationship between firm productivity and firm growth, contributing to aggregate productivity growth.  

The intangibles data are drawn from different sources. Detailed software investment is found in the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES, 2002+). Advertising and expensed software are found in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers/Census of Manufactures (ASM/CM, 2007+), the Service Annual Survey (SAS, 2009+), the Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS) including the Business Expenses Supplement. Software expenditures are also found in the Information & Communication Technology Survey (ICTS) supplement to ACES for 2003-13. R&D data come from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS/SIRD, 1976+) and linked data on patents is from the USPTO for 2000-2018. Data will be linked using the Longitudinal Business Database, the County Business Patterns Business Register, and Bridge files from 1976 on."
