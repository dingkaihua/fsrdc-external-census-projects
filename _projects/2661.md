abstract: "We will generate the first cross-city panel dataset of rent control and inclusionary zoning reforms and estimate their effect on housing supply and rents. To generate the reform data, we will use machine learning algorithms to analyze newspaper articles across the U.S. between 2000 and 2021. We will then merge these reform data with a new dataset that we will generate from restricted census microdata from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey on the number of rental units within each city that are affordable to households of different area median incomes. We will then estimate a fixed effects model, synthetic control models, and instrumental variable models (using state reforms as instruments) to examine the effect of different types of rent control and inclusionary zoning regulations on measures of housing affordability."
