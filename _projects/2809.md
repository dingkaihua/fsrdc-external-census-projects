abstract: "We aim to improve current methods for assessing Pb hazards and advance solutions related to 1) lack of integrated biological and environmental datasets, 2) lack of innovative cumulative and predictive risk assessment tools, 3) a feasible, convenient approach to identifying households for investigation and mitigation that can be scaled to expanded geographical areas, and 4) better protection of vulnerable populations and those living in affordable housing. Despite evidence that Pb exposure is still occurring in childhood homes, comprehensive and nationally applicable data and tools for identifying at-risk homes and communities are lacking.

Our project uses state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms and citizen science-based testing, paired with data sharing from community partners, to devise predictive Pb risk tools that bridge the gap between wondering about Pb household exposure risks and understanding the complete household Pb exposome. The results could greatly improve current methods for assessing and mitigating Pb hazards.

First, we will leverage existing big data sets as the foundation of our research, including biological data (approximately 100,000 childhood Pb blood levels from 2002-2019), soils data (464 residential Pb soil levels measured in Greensboro, NC, in 2018-2019), multimedia household Pb investigation data from 2002-2019 (from homes where Pb evaluations were previously conducted), household demographic and socioeconomic indicators (from ACS 2000-2020), water source and water quality information, and proximity to current and legacy Pb sources.

Second, we will advance residential risk assessment by using innovative, non-traditional methods that can identify how subtle differences in geography, household demographics, household structures, and environmental media contribute to Pb exposure risk across households. Traditional risk assessment methods often focus on one source of Pb exposure, such as paint, without evaluating the whole household exposome. Furthermore, additional factors, such as the role that household demographics play in Pb exposure, are omitted. Our Bayesian network modeling approach ensures that we pinpoint the range and likelihood of Pb exposure risks for children, and further, that we identify the importance of each risk factor and the relative Pb source contribution by household. The variability in our extensive data set will allow us to predict household variability in Pb exposure risk, as well as variability across cities or counties.

Third, we will validate our innovative risk assessment findings by conducting multi-media testing in households. We plan to adapt an existing award-winning online enrollment, citizen science training, and reporting approach available at www.cleanwaterforuskids.org which will also improve the ease of residential Pb assessment. This part of the project also will provide an opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of previous Pb abatement activities, because we will collect samples from dwellings that have and have not undergone remediation"
