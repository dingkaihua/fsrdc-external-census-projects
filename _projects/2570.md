abstract: "In this project, the researchers will explore whether an increase in market power across industries, as measured by markups at the firm and establishment level has led to an increase in income inequality at the county, MSA, and Census tract level. The research will examine the impact of competitiveness of industries on labor movement across establishments (reallocation, hiring, and firing rates), profits of firms, changes in the patterns of sources of financing and inputs for production, and pollution at the firm and establishment level. Moreover, this project will characterize how the impact on these socio-economic outcomes varies depending on firm-, establishment-, and worker-level characteristics, and will further examine the implications for productivity and economic growth. To measure competition across industries, the researchers will also use other measures such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the number of establishments per square mile, and the number of firms per square mile, among others."
