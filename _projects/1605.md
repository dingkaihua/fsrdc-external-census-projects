abstract: "Firms vary substantially in their productivity, suggesting that the allocation of capital and labor across firms is important in determining aggregate outcomes. This project examines whether changes in this allocation over time are important for understanding aggregate trends and business cycle fluctuations in the United States. The main measure of allocation is built on the distribution of marginal revenue products across establishments at a given point in time. How does this allocation respond to aggregate shocks? Did tightened borrowing constraints worsen the allocation of resources in the recent crisis? Are recessions “cleansing” (times the allocation improves) or “sullying” (times when it worsens)? This project will develop new estimates of the allocation of resources across establishments and firms in the United States. "
