abstract: "This project will use Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data in combination with researcher-provided data to study fatal occupational injury rates in North Carolina over the forty-year period 1977-2017. Data on occupational fatalities in North Carolina come from the state's medical examiner system as well as death certificate files from the North Carolina Division of Public Health. Information on fatal injuries describes the sex, race, year of birth, occupation, and industry of the decedent, as well as the year of fatal injury and death. A prior study by the researchers using public Decennial Census data analyzes fatal occupational injuries in North Carolina between 1977 and 1991, when North Carolina's population was 6.6 million. North Carolina now has 9.9 million residents and the state's economy has changed substantially since 1991, with employment shifting dramatically away from agriculture, textile, and furniture production to a more diversified economy with a diverse workforce. This research will encompass a comprehensive epidemiological study of fatal occupational injuries between 1977 and the present, comparing findings to - and updating - the previous research."
