abstract: "This study examines neighborhood-level employment and poverty status following changes in the minimum wage, with a focus on whether any changes in employment status disproportionally affect socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. The project will use the 2005-2013 American Community Survey (ACS) and 1960-2010 Decennial Census microdata to generate neighborhood-level employment outcome estimates at the Census tract-level. "
