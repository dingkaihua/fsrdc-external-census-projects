abstract: "This is a proposal for research on the evolution of the productivity, employment, and performance of firms in the U.S. food manufacturing sector in the last 20 years. As food processing is an old and well-established part of manufacturing, however, we think that the conclusions drawn for these firms will illuminate problems and present conclusions that are valid for any manufacturing (and even services) firm during the period under study. Since the focus of the research is U.S. food manufacturing, we will work with the NAICS code 311 industries (code 311 includes nine 4-digit codes, and forty-three 6-digit codes). Our aim is to produce model-based statistical evidence, wherein the modeling takes the manufacturing establishment as the unit of analysis. This project will link the Survey of Manufactures (ASM), the Census of Manufacturers (CMF) and the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to develop a longitudinal dataset for U.S. food manufacturing establishments for multiple years and then assess their internal comparability. A new database will thus be assembled to assist in evaluating any data inconsistencies that may need attention in terms of reported sales and employment and types of employment reported, using CMF as a benchmark to measure potential errors."
