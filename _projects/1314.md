abstract: "This project investigates how local competition among suppliers within geographically segmented markets drives manufacturing firms' decisions of whether to integrate or outsource the production of their intermediate inputs, and if they outsource, whether to buy the input from domestic producers or import it from abroad. Using Census of Manufactures, Commodity Flow Survey, and foreign trade data, this research examines market outcomes such as mark-ups, prices, and quantities supplied, as well as consumers' welfare. "
