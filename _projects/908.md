abstract: "This research will systematically document the industry and sectoral variation in the distribution of firms and their dynamics by estimating a set of statistical models. Some of the variation is expected to be explained by the intensity of "non-pecuniary" entrepreneurs, a hypothesis that this study will test. In addition, this research will explore whether the propensity to spend on research and development varies inversely with the intensity of non-pecuniary entrepreneurs. "
