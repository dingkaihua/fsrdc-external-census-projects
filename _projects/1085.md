abstract: "This project uses integrated data to measure the characteristics and dynamics of small and non-employer businesses, and evaluates how well Census Bureau data products measure small business dynamics and the characteristics of small business owners. Home equity is an important source of capital for many small business ventures, but it is possible that the business activities of these marginal entrepreneurs are not well represented, or well measured in Census Bureau data. This research evaluates how measurement of small- and non-employer business characteristics and dynamics change with access to home equity. A change in Texas law provides a natural experiment to directly evaluate how well administrative and survey sources measure the characteristics and activity of business that rely on this form of financing. Economic growth may depend on the ability to convert personal property into liquid capital, but testing such a theory is difficult since it is hard to disentangle the effects of the ability to borrow from other institutional and economic variables. The Texas law change provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of changing one feature of the bundle of property rights that attach to home ownership. Specifically, the research design uses the variation in access to home equity financing induced by the law change to identify its influence on the formation and growth of small and young businesses."
