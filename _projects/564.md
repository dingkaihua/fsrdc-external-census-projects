abstract: "This project uses Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data to investigate the hypothesis that firms compress wages. It will use merged data to construct measures of mass layoffs, individual displacement, and voluntary mobility among firms. The proposed testable hypotheses relate to the role of workers’ ranks within their firms’ wage distributions in predicting mobility decisions and wage changes, which requires use of the dense data about each firm’s wage structure to construct measures of within-firm worker ranks. The measurement of job transitions will provide several important benefits to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) currently provide information on worker flows by worker characteristics and within fairly general (2-digit) industries, but the underlying data can support more disaggregated presentations. The project develops statistics that distinguish mass layoffs from other sources of worker flows and on the relation of the various types of flows to worker and plant characteristics. It explores the sensitivity of these measures to alternative methods for measuring displacement, and discusses options for incorporating statistics on mass layoffs into the QWI data. The first step in development of prototype QWI extensions will be the creation of consistent time series of employment at each firm, taking account of spurious changes arising from data shortcomings. This will be used to identify firm events such as establishment closings and mass layoffs under several definitions. The research will also extend existing measures of worker separations and accessions and the new displacement statistics to describe their distributions across firm size and worker seniority categories—each important components of any assessment of the economic impact of these events."
