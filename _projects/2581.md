abstract: "The central appeal of market-based environmental instruments is cost-effectiveness. Despite strong consensus amongst economists and environmental policy makers, there is limited to no causal evidence that environmental markets are less costly than traditional command-and-control strategies. We develop an empirical test of misallocation of emission abatement using observed data from all U.S. greenhouse gas and air pollution emission markets. Specifically, we compare the variance of average revenue per emission for industries covered by pollution markets to similar industries regulated under command-and-control strategies. Less dispersion of average revenue per emission for facilities in industries covered by air pollution markets serves as an indicator of market efficiency."
