abstract: "This research attempts to assess whether the business sector on American Indian reservations differs significantly from its off-reservation counterpart. Specifically, does the reservation business sector exhibit distinctly different spatial density, as well as entry, exit, and growth rate dynamics and technology, and if so, why? This project applies multivariate econometric models to relate the observed differences to spatial, demographic, and institutional factors. This research will also enhance existing Census Bureau business data by geocoding for reservation location. "
