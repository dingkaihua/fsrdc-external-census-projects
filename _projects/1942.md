abstract: "Growing evidence suggests that recessions catalyze lasting changes in the U.S. economy. For example, every recession since 1973 has led to a persistent decrease in earnings per capita in counties where the recession was more severe (Greenstone and Looney, 2010; Stuart, 2017). The overall consequence of this finding depends on why recessions lead to persistent declines in local economic activity. Local economic activity could decline because high-income individuals are more likely to migrate away from places experiencing negative economic shocks (Bound and Holzer, 2000; Notowidigdo, 2013), or because employers change their production process (Jaimovich and Siu, 2015; Hershbein and Kahn, 2017) or shut down (Foster, Grim, and Haltiwanger, 2016). Although a large literature documents the consequences of recessions, there is relatively little evidence that specifically examines why recessions lead to persistent declines in local economic activity.
This project will benefit the U.S. Census Bureau by enhancing the measurement of local economic activity and providing new evidence on the effects of recessions on workers, employers, and local labor markets. "
