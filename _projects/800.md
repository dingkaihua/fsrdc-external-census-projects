abstract: "This project describes and estimates models of student geographic mobility. Its objective is to support ongoing research on college-going behavior among high school graduates. This work focuses on the college-going behavior of youth residing near college taxing districts. It exploits the abrupt change in tuition costs at college taxing district boundaries to estimate price elasticities of demand for higher education. For this proposal, we use household data from the restricted-version of the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey to test a key identifying assumption: college-age youth on opposite, yet adjacent, sides of community college taxing district boundaries are similar along observable dimensions. This work will enhance the utility Census Bureau data in two ways. First, it contributes to developing means of increasing the utility of Census Bureau data for analyzing public programs and policies. Accordingly, the project will link census blocks for a large state with detailed information on college taxing district attributes such as tuition levels and property tax rates. Furthermore, the proposal contributes to preparing estimates of population and characteristics of populations by examining the extent to which college tuition subsidies affect geographic mobility and whether such subsidies are capitalized into housing values."
