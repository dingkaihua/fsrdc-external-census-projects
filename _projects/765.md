abstract: "Empirical evidence shows that family members bargain over nondurable household consumption decisions. It stands to reason that they also bargain over more longstanding decisions such as modes of transportation. In order to gain a better understanding of congestion, one must consider both the interplay between residential and commuting mode choices, and how those decisions are made within the family. Using data from the Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), this research develops a joint model of family residential choice and commuting method. It aims to make four key contributions to the literature. First, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, this work is the first to explicitly model both residential and commuting choices together using nationwide, individual level data.  Other research controls for distance to the head of household's job in a residential choice model but focuses on Tiebout sorting in housing markets, not commuting decisions. Second, the model does not treat households as unified decision making entities. This research uses the collective household model to improve upon the current residential choice literature, which treats multi-person households as single agents. Third, the framework here allows for an additional empirical test of the hypothesis that the collective model accurately approximates household behavior. Finally, the ultimate goal of this work is to conduct simulations that predict the land use impacts of congestion pricing and other transportation strategies. These simulations can be used to evaluate the costs and benefits of these strategies."
