abstract: "Understanding the determinants of firm investment is an important question at the heart of the economic discipline. The difficulty of empirically analyzing the factors that drive firm investment arises from the fact that investment is highly volatile throughout the business cycle and responds to a wide variety of global and local economic shocks. One of the main open questions regarding the determinants of firm investment is how equity income taxation affects a firm’s cost of capital and thus its incentives to invest. This research uses the tax cuts in dividends and capital gains included in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 in order to shed light on this question. This project uses data from the Census of Manufactures, the Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey, and the Survey of Industrial Research and Development to construct a panel of plants spanning from 1994 to 2007. Other U.S. Census Bureau data will be employed in order to match the census datasets with other American and international databases. The main assumption is that only firms incorporated in the United States, and thus with a majority of shareholders subject to U.S. tax law, will be potentially affected by a decrease in the cost of capital induced by the 2003 equity income tax cuts. The analysis will control for those plant and firm characteristics identified as determinants of investment and will be able to attribute any differences in investment between plants that only differ in the country of incorporation of their parent firms to the effects of changes in equity income taxation, effec­tively differencing away those determinants of investment related to the business cycle and other local and global economic shocks that impact profitability. Census microdata also allows for quantification of the effect of those other variables identified as potential determinants of investment. The focus on a time period around a sizeable tax reform represents a unique opportunity to obtain estimates less subject to severe measurement error, given that changes in taxation induce firms to reevaluate their investment levels in order to reflect the new economic environment. The analysis of investment can shed light on how constant capital expenditures are across time, and thus help design imputation strategies for nonresponse in capital expenditures survey questions. The link between census datasets and several international databases will provide financial information for those foreign-incorporated companies that own plants in the United States. This link will enable an assessment of the quality of the ownership data contained in the census files and can be useful to analyze the characteristics of multinational companies that own plants in the United States."
