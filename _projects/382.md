abstract: "The project I am proposing will contribute in four ways to the understanding and improvement of Census data: first, it will develop filtering and flagging programs, which will identify unusual and potentially spurious observations for plants in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM). Second, it will also estimate or impute data for missing observations or observations deemed likely to be spurious. Third, because the project estimates population moments from relatively long panels of plants, it will further the understanding of the representativeness and usefulness of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. Finally, the project will further the understanding of the dynamic behavior of plants, in particular their demand for labor. In this regard, the project proposes to answer two sets of questions related to the behavior of plant level employment: (1) do plants time their restructuring activities to correspond with fluctuations in the business cycle and if so, which types of plants are more likely to do so, and (2) are there asymmetric movements in job flows at the plant level and do these plant-level asymmetric movements, if they exist, translate into asymmetric job flow movements at the aggregate level. Answering these questions requires the construction of panels of plants from the ASM, with panels grouped by relevant plant characteristics, such as size and industry. To prevent spurious data from contaminating results, I will filter out or flag unusual patterns in plantsâ€™ time series of characteristics as well as impute data that is either missing or appears spurious. To appropriately interpret my results, I will compare characteristics of plants from my longitudinal samples to the overall ASM, evaluating the representativeness, and hence the usefulness, of estimates constructed from longitudinal data. The data sets I will need are the ASM from 1972 to the most recent available and the Census of Manufacturers (CM) from 1967 to the most recent available. Considerable processing of this data has already been performed in the construction of data files for the Gross Flows project. Thus, I would also like to have access to many of the files constructed from the ASM and the CM in the Gross Flows project."
