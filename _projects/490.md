abstract: "This study will produce estimates of manufacturing productivity of businesses in U.S. regions that differ according to their industrial structure and agglomeration characteristics. Specifically, it will compare the production efficiency and realized agglomeration economies of business establishments in regions dominated by a few large firms with establishments in regions with a broad mix of firms and sectors. The substantive results are expected to yield insights into the forces driving regional economic growth and adjustment. The project will aid the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s mission by producing new estimates of productivity that account for the role of regional corporate structure, by developing and documenting procedures for linking Census Bureau data to Dun and Bradstreet MarketPlace data, and by evaluating the consistency of Census Bureau data with Dun and Bradstreet data. The project will link the MarketPlace data to the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) and to the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). In the process of linking Census Bureau data to MarketPlace data, the project will create a documented crosswalk file that can be used in the future to link establishments in the MarketPlace data to those in Census data. The project will use the linked data to compare data items (i.e., establishment name, establishment address) in the MarketPlace data to those in the SSEL. The project will also compare employment, sales, and ownership structure in the LRD to those items in the MarketPlace data to check the quality of data collected in the Annual Surveys and Censuses of Manufactures.
