abstract: "There is widespread evidence that in the last few decades there has been a widening gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers. Numerous empirical studies suggest there is a link between this growing skill wage differential and the use of new technologies. However, most of these studies have one notable limitation – i.e., they are typically restricted to cross-sectional data, and thus, unable to control for unobservable worker and firm characteristics. This makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of selection bias from the true productivity effects of using these technologies. Distinguishing these two components ideally requires longitudinal information from both workers and firms. With this project we intend to investigate the impact technology use has on workers’ wages in U.S. manufacturing plants by constructing and exploiting a unique Linked Employee-Employer data set containing longitudinal worker and plant information. Among other things, the construction of this dataset will develop links across time and entities using census data and administrative data, will also explore the value of administrative data to provide economic information to enhance census surveys, and furthermore, will identify some shortcomings of census collection programs. We will examine the effect of technology use on wage determination and ask the following questions: Does the skill wage differential increase after the implementation of new technologies in the workplace as suggested by the skill biased technological change hypothesis? Or do high tech firms employ a selection of high ability workers? And if demand for low skilled workers indeed falls after the introduction of new technologies, do we observe the adjustment of prices or quantities? Does the hazard of exiting the firm increase for low skilled workers after the introduction of new technologies? Is skill upgrading a consequence of technology adoption? This project will address these questions using the Long Form of the 1990 Decennial Census, the Survey of Manufacturing Technologies (1988 and 1993), the Business Register (SSEL 1985-1997), and Unemployment Insurance data for the state of Maryland."
