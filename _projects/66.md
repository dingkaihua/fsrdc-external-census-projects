abstract: "The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) - Insurance Component (IC) conducted by the United States Census Bureau is a key economic survey that provides important information on employer sponsored health insurance for the nation. Published results from this survey are used by the Bureau of Economic Analyses as a key input to health care costs in Gross Domestic Product. Results are also used by numerous other government agencies, including, the General Accounting Office and Treasury to support Congressional requests and assess the status and costs of employer health insurance. States also use the data as key input into their economic analyses. As a key user and sponsor of this survey, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) wishes to increase the quality and utility of this Census data. Because of the principal investigators’ unique knowledge of employer-sponsored health insurance and their econometric and statistical expertise, they have already contributed extensively to the technical aspects of the survey and to improvements in the quality of the IC data and its uses. This project should contribute to this effort to improve the survey. Among the goals of this research are the following:
• Produce estimates related to the supply and demand of employer-sponsored health insurance.
• Develop new and improved methodologies for producing such population estimates.
• Develop an understanding of the quality of data collected, through analysis of response rates, item response rates and data collection results, in order to produce changes in questionnaire structure and collection methodology that will improve collected data.
• Identify shortcomings of the questionnaire to obtain the information necessary to produce reliable population estimates related to employer-sponsored health insurance."
