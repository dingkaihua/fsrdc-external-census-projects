abstract: "This project proposes to analyze interactions between household work and U.S. disability insurance (DI) programs. Within the context of a household model of life cycle consumption and labor supply, we will use those interactions to examine the welfare and behavioral effects of changing the environment in which work, DI application, and consumption decisions are made. We propose to do this using the linked SIPP-SSA data. This proposal is motivated primarily by three features of DI programs in the United States which could generate substantial variation in the costs of applying for DI, depending on the characteristics of one's household. The first of these features is that DI application process is both long and uncertain (in terms of duration of the decision period and application outcome).  The second feature is that no constraints are placed on the earnings of other members of an applicant's household. Therefore, there is room for households to maintain income during the application process through other household members. The third feature is that access to medical insurance coverage is very limited during the application process. This feature is unique to DI programs of the United States, among developed countries; private medical insurance in the United States is closely tied to employment. These three features suggest that the (exogenously determined) composition of household structures in the United States has implications for the work disincentive effects and welfare value of the country's DI programs. With the unique interactions between medical insurance coverage and employment in the United States, the household may have a more important role to play in driving who applies for DI benefits in the United States than in other countries."
