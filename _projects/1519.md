abstract: "This project investigates the impact of structural transformation on the process of regional economic convergence. An earlier literature documented strong evidence of regional convergence of incomes per capita throughout the United States up until the 1980s. That is, workers in poorer states were catching up to workers in the richer states, just as simple neoclassical growth models would predict. But, over the past 30 years, regional convergence amongst the U.S. states has dramatically diminished, presenting a puzzle for macroeconomists. Structural transformation, defined as both employment shifts between sectors and as the transformation of the production technology of any given sector may be a major cause of this convergence slow-down. This project estimates speeds of convergence for different sectors at new, more precise levels of geographic and industrial disaggregation as well as estimates the potential determinants of convergence speed, such as education, capital-intensity, technology, trade exposure, legal organization, R&D, and so on. These new empirical results will reveal whether and how different kinds of structural transformation might slow down the convergence process."
