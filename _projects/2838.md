abstract: "We aim to study the determinants and implications of firms' labor hiring strategies, i.e., whether to poach from other firms or to hire from nonemployment. We plan to use the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database to measure a firm's poaching rate, namely, the number of poached workers scaled by its total number of new hires, and merge the data with researcher-provided datasets such as Compustat and the Center of Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) database for the empirical tests. Specifically, we predict that firms with better corporate governance, lower cost of debt, more private equity or bank financing, and those in skill-intensive industries have higher poaching rates. Further, firms going public or getting acquired by more dispersedly owned firms will also become more likely to poach rather than hire from nonemployment. In terms of the implications of differential labor hiring strategies, we hypothesize that firms with higher poaching rates have less procyclical hiring costs, pay less procyclical wages, have more procyclical profits, and thus have higher expected stock returns. In addition, the technology investment of firms with higher poaching rates will be more sensitive to changes in technology price. Our study will contribute to the labor and finance literature by examining the interaction between labor hiring strategies and firms' financials, and by uncovering an important source of firms' equity risk through their hiring styles."
