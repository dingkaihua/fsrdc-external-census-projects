abstract: "Researchers tend to know much less about small, rural communities than their larger, urban counterparts. In part, this dearth of knowledge reflects a U.S. population that is overwhelmingly urban, where most large-scale demographic and economic phenomena of interest occur in micro and metropolitan areas. However, there remain 6 million residents of areas with populations less than 2,500 inhabitants, whose social contexts are much less well-known than those who live in larger places. Even less clear is how the demographic makeup of these small, rural places has changed over time, while an even greater share of the population has left these tiny towns and settled in cities. This project aims to better understand the demographic characteristics and migration patterns of these communities by creating and validating a harmonized, place-based dataset for the 1930-2020 period using a combination of Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and publicly available data."
