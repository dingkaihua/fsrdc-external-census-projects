abstract: "The purpose of this proposal is to examine the quality of U.S. Census Bureau data on auxiliary offices and their firms and to perform an analysis of the firm determinants of nonresponse in Auxiliary Establishment (AE) datasets. We will investigate the determinants of a firm’s decision to establish a separate headquarters facility, where to locate it, and the determinants of out-sourcing behavior by headquarters.   We will use AE data, which provide information about the administrative establishments of firms. Since few researchers have used these data, assessing the quality of the data is an important part of the project.  First, we will link the AE data to Compustat® and to the Business Register in order to recover the main headquarters of the firm. Second, the characteristics of firms, as well as of local input service suppliers, will be constructed.  Finally, the purchased service expenditures information in the AE and other datasets will be used to investigate outsourcing behavior.   The project will benefit Census Bureau programs by exploring identification of the function performed by central administrative office (CAO) auxiliary establishments in the AE survey, both from the perspective of differentiating headquarters offices from other administrative units, as well as through an exploration of nonresponse to the function related questions on the survey. The project will explain which firms tend to have central administrative offices, where they locate them, and how their outsourcing behavior can be characterized."
