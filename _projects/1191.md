abstract: "The research investigates the impact of pollution abatement spending on a variety of economic and environmental outcomes at manufacturing plants, including production costs and productivity, employment, investment, location, and emissions of various pollutants. Timing of the transition process is of particular interest as new regulations take effect, potentially influencing investment in pollution abatement capital equipment, changes in production processes, and shifts in activity across plants. This research considers both the initial expansion of federal regulation in the 1970s and later regulations, such as EPA’s multimedia cluster rule affecting the pulp and paper industry and California’s recent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The analyses take advantage of the plant- and firm-level detail in the Census Bureau data in testing whether different types of plants and firms show different responses to pollution abatement costs.
