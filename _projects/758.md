abstract: "Recent studies have found a significant relationship between environmental regulation and job loss. However, little is known about those affected by regulation induced job separation, including the significant costs incurred by those displaced. Several authors, including the EPA, have stressed the importance of accounting for adjustment costs of environmental mandates. However, little work has been done in this area, mostly as a result of limitations involving data. I plan to use the very rich administrative data of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics file to explore transitional impacts of the Clean Air Act Amendments of the 1990's. With the data, I will be able to provide robust estimates as to unemployment duration and long term earnings losses associated with increased air quality mandates. The richness of the data also allows me to examine whether regulation induces job transfer within or across industries. This project will provide the first estimates as to the adjustment costs associated with transitioning into a more stringent environmental regime. "
