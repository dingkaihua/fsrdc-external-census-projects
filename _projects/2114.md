abstract: "This project examines the link between Americans' context--defined as their physical, social, and informational environment--and their civic engagement (e.g. participating in community groups, engaging in boycotts, etc.) in order to improve understanding of the Volunteering & Civic Life Supplement (VCL) of the Current Population Survey and suggest possible changes to its sampling strategy for future iterations. Traditionally, studies of civic engagement in the United States either use relatively small national surveys to give a general overview of Americans' behavior or employ mixed methods to delve more deeply into behavior within a handful of specific communities. To extend beyond these two approaches, I will use large Census datasets to conduct multilevel analysis of civic engagement nationwide that considers the influence of both individual and local/contextual factors. In addition, I will compare models created using the Census Civic Engagement Supplement (2008-2011, 2013) and VCL Supplement (2017-2019) datasets with similar models that include many other related political attitudes and behaviors measured by the General Social Survey and American National Election Survey (but with fewer respondents). This research offers three key benefits for Census. First, preparations for the analysis require detailed investigation of the previous year-by-year and country-by-county samples for the CES/VCL. This examination will underpin an assessment of the sampling frame's strengths and weaknesses for measuring civic engagement over time in disparate types of communities. Second, comparative analysis with external surveys that include measurement of additional related variables will contextualize findings from the VCL and improve our understanding of its results. Third, the emphasis on community context and the use of multilevel models complements existing Federal/Census approaches to estimating civic health and may contribute to future strategies for understanding civic health in different types of communities across the rural-urban spectrum."
