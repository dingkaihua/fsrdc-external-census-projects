abstract: "Beginning with Oates (1969) There exists a voluminous literature in economics on the effects of property taxation on housing prices and, to a much less extent, on how property taxes affect locational decisions. That property taxes affect housing prices is, it has been argued by Oates and others, is an indication that households incorporate local public policies, taxes and public expenditures, into their decisions of where to reside as argued by Tiebout (1956). Further, the relationship between how property taxes and levels of public services each affect property values has been used in numerous studies to ascertain whether public services are efficiently provided or not (Oates (1969), Brueckner (1979, 1982), Barrow and Rouse (2004), and Bayer, Blair, and Whalley (2021) among others). What has been ignored in virtually all this literature, except for Banzhaf et al (2021), is the extensive number and variety of property tax exemptions provided by states. For households eligible for these exemptions, their tax payment, the product of the assessed value of their home and the local property tax (millage) rate, is not, in fact, the taxes they pay on their home but something less. That these exemptions vary among states and by taxpayer characteristics, most importantly age, suggest that households might change where they reside (which state or type of residence in which they reside (rental vs. owner-occupied) to take advantage of these exemptions. This project aims to address this deficiency in the literature by estimating various hedonic pricing models to produce real estate value estimates as well as various population estimates including elasticities of migration in response to changes in property tax exemption generosity"
