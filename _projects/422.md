abstract: "This project will examine supplier-customer relationships (also known as vertical linkages) and the impact of these relationships on investment decisions. The Census Bureau has explicitly stated a need for “specific recommendations regarding how to better capture and describe supply chain activities in the 2002 Economic Census and in our current economic statistics” (Mesenbourg 2001). This project will develop a methodology to capture and describe these supply chain activities using internal Census economic microdata (Census of Manufacturing, Annual Survey of Manufacturing, Census of Construction, Longitudinal Business Database, Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization) combined with Input-Output Tables of the American Economy compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and will provide this methodology to Census. In addition, knowledge gained from these analyses will be used to address several data quality issues in these data sets (i.e., studying patterns of non-response, developing new imputation methods, conducting consistency checks). The project will then use these relationship measures to examine firms’ decisions to adopt electronic commerce infrastructure based on their suppliers’ and customers’ actions as well as to examine capital investment decisions by ready-mix concrete plants based on downstream local construction activity. Hence, this project will not only benefit the Census Bureau by producing a methodology to capture and describe these supply chains but will also provide knowledge useful for addressing a multitude of data quality issues. Vertical linkages between firms play an enormous role in the functioning of the economy. A large fraction of output from plants across the country is not consumed by individuals but is utilized in other firms’ production processes. These linkages are key to explaining investment behavior -- if a firm’s customers are growing rapidly, it is apt to expand its operations to meet future demand. The two applications chosen for this project, enumerated above, have a guiding methodological principle: the use of information about the relationships between firms, either sectors that trade with each other in the case of e-commerce or concrete plants that sell neighboring construction projects, to understand why firms make capital investments. Since both applications of these projects study firm-level decisions, non-public Census data are required. This project will primarily use data from the Longitudinal Research Database (i.e., the longitudinally linked conjunction of the Census of Manufacturing and the ASM) but will also use data from the Census of Construction, the Longitudinal Business Database, and the Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization."
