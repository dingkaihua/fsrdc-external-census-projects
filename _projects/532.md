abstract: "This project will reclassify the estimates of research and development (R&D) performance in the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) from ﬁrm-based industries to establishment-based industries using a consistent industry classiﬁcation (NAICS) for the entire time series of the SIRD. The research will convey beneﬁts to the Census Bureau along three dimensions by producing estimates of R&D using establishment-based industry codes; by conducting data quality assessments of the SIRD data, which exploit the longitudinal nature of the data; and by analyzing ﬁrm-establishment relationships. The Census Bureau is currently in the process of a major redesign of the SIRD, so the insights gained from this project will be particularly timely in contributing to the improvement of the future versions of the SIRD. The project will make an important contribution to the Census Bureau’s eﬀorts to classify economic information on an establishment basis by identifying the establishments within each ﬁrm that are most likely to perform the ﬁrm’s R&D. Identifying these establishments within each ﬁrm will also substantially improve the Census Bureau’s eﬀ orts to accurately measure economic activity within states because many R&D-performing companies have establishments in more than one state."
