abstract: "This project examines the potential causal effects of in utero exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic on later life mortality and economic and social outcomes. The project first replicates previous findings indicating substantial evidence that exposure to the flu reduces years of schooling and income and increases several measures of poor health. The research will extend these findings to include measures of health insurance, occupation, mobility, marital status, and spousal characteristics. Although some of these intermediate and long-term effects have been documented in several papers, much less is known about the links with mortality. The research will help to fill in this gap by estimating overall and cause-specific mortality outcomes using the restricted National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) data. "
