abstract: "Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the disabled and blind are both federal programs designed to insure people against loss of income due to health conditions, and participation in these programs is an important issue for millions of American households. Together, DI and SSI make up one of the four major insurance programs of the country (Krueger and Meyer, 2002). This study will examine the employment effects of DI and SSI and will explore channels of disability insurance application as well as factors influencing disability insurance applications. This research will use the Census Bureauâ€™s primary survey of government transfer programs, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The researchers will link SIPP panels (core and selected modules) to the Master Beneficiary Records (MBR) of the SSA, to the so-called 831 files, and to earnings records. Usage of these SIPP surveys will be further enhanced by creating monthly and weekly person-level panels, and by assessing the quality of self-reported health status in the SIPP."
