abstract: "This project will investigate the immediate effects and enduring legacy of investments in public higher education in the United States for people and places, with a particular focus on investments made in the 1960's. Specifically, research questions include:

(1)	How consistent is reporting on educational attainment for individuals over time and across Census sources? 

(2)	How do historic public investments in higher education relate to educational, economic, social, and civic inequalities across and within states today?

(3)	How did historic public investments in higher education impact the long-term educational, economic, social, and civic outcomes of individuals--and their children and grandchildren (if available)? 

(4)	How did historic public investments in higher education affect the economic, demographic, and social characteristics of places? 

(5)	How does public investment in higher education interact with public investment in K-12 and/or early childhood education? 
	
To investigate these questions we will use restricted-use microdata versions of the Decennial Censuses, American Community Survey, and Current Population Survey for years spanning from 1940 to present day."
