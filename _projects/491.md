abstract: "This project will develop an improved method for using U.S. Census Bureau data to measure the economic impacts of the interregional flow of goods and services and by providing to the Census Bureau advice that will improve the methodologies used to collect information on the interregional flow of goods and services.  An additional purpose of this project is to analyze the shipment of manufactured goods among states and sub-state regions within the United States using Commodity Flows Survey (CFS) data. The analysis will model the patterns of trade in manufactured goods among states and BEA economic areas using widely accepted regional location theory.  Through this research, we plan to show how Census Bureau data could be better used to assess the economic impact of shocks by employing improved methods for using Census Bureau data and by suggesting changes to the collection methodologies used for the CFS. This will significantly benefit the Census Bureau through improved utility of its CFS.  The improved method employed for measuring the impact of economic shocks to localities relies on the estimation of regression-based Regional Purchase Coefficients (RPCs), based on Census Bureau microdata. We will calculate these RPCs using linked CFS, Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Census of Manufactures data. Ultimately, the RPCs will be used at BEA in two ways. First, an analysis of RPCs over time will shed light on how trade in intermediates has changed. Second, the RPCs will be used to estimate equations, which relate RPCs to characteristics of state economies."
