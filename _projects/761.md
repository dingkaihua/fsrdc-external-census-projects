abstract: "This project uses establishment-level data to estimate returns to scale in U.S. manufacturing and construction firms. Understanding how the degree of returns to scale shapes the production of investment goods will be instrumental for the U.S. Census Bureau to understand establishment-level data. Constructing a comprehensive panel of manufacturing firms and estimating production functions can identify the degree of returns to scale at the establishment level. Regressing output on factor inputs will deliver the degree of returns to scale. Prices for equipment and structure investment behave very differently which suggests differential technologies and returns to scale. To pay special attention to that difference, the Census of Construction Industries is used to contrast construction firms to manufacturing establishments. This project benefits the Census Bureau by correcting for measurement error, imputing capital stock for manufacturing establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures, seasonally adjusting older (annual) Plant Capacity Utilization data, and estimating capacity utilization for a large population of manufacturing plants that is not covered at present. This project will also deliver a precise estimate of the degree of returns to scale that is free from aggregation bias. This information is very relevant by helping to assess two competing theories of macroeconomic fluctuations. Understanding the source, nature, and transmission of fluctuations will not only advance the insight in the field of fluctuations but will also have neighboring fields in economics."
