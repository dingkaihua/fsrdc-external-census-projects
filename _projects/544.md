abstract: "Measuring foreign trade in the United States, who trades, how it is conducted, where it originates, where it goes, and its impact on the U.S. economy is an important mission of the U.S. Census Bureau. A principal objective of the project is to build on prior work by linking additional years of import and export transaction data to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and enhancing the existing match of 1993 and 2000 data. The additional years to link are 1992, and 1994–1999 (with the hope of obtaining (and linking) additional years of data from the Foreign Trade Division). The links are made via the EIN information on the import and export transaction files to the Standard Statistical Establishment List files (SSEL) and for exports to Canada, the link is made via business name. We propose to investigate improved matching methodologies using enhanced statistical matching algorithms. 
With the additional linked data, the project proposes to examine a number of issues to increase the Census Bureau’s understanding of the quality of data collected in Title 13, Chapter 5 programs. The topical areas to be investigated include multinational corporation import and export pricing and valuation behavior, geographic and product market entry, the impact of trade on the domestic economy, and treatment of inventory in transit. The project requests the use of all economic census and survey data for the years 1963 through the most recent available (and future years as they become available), the SSEL files (including name and address information) for 1975-most recent available (and future years as they become available), the LBD for 1975-most recent available (and future years as they become available), the Foreign Trade Division import and export transaction data for 1992–2000 (and future years should they become available). The project will also make use of a number of publicly available datasets that the research team will provide. "
