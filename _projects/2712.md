abstract: "We will develop an unbiased measure of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and investigate the sources of productivity growth by analyzing management and organizational practices, technological change, efficiency, and scale effects at the establishment-and firm-levels in the US food and beverage products industry.  To generate consistent estimates of firm productivity and efficiency measures, we will estimate a flexible production function of a firm using innovative estimation techniques (e.g., stochastic frontier approach, production function approach) and take the issues of endogeneity and omitted variable bias into consideration.  Unbiased measures of production parameters will then be used to decompose TFP into components (e.g., scale effect, technological change effect, efficiency effect, managerial and organizational practices effect).  In our estimation, we will take into consideration of firm's heterogenous characteristics such as firms' age, location, size, ownership change status (mergers and acquisitions), managerial and organizational practices, and firm's export and import status. We will contribute to the existing literature by investigating the market power issues in both input and output markets since prior studies analyzing US food industries mainly focused on market power in output markets.  Specifically, we will incorporate the role of market power in the U.S. food industries by estimating markups and markdowns in output and input markets."
