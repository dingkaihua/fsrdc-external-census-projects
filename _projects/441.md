abstract: "This project examines the value of supplementing official Census Bureau measures of poverty, income, and the income distribution with measures based on multiple years of income, potentially up to an individualâ€™s entire lifetime. The research studies how perspectives of income inequality and the career paths of low-wage workers differ, when viewed from an annual and a lifetime perspective. It also analyzes how the distributional impacts of the Social Security system and the tax system (including the Earned Income Tax Credit) differ when viewed from a lifetime perspective rather than from an annual perspective. This research aims to produce a comprehensive analysis of the impact of government tax and transfer programs on the lifetime income distribution, incorporating components such as TANF and SSI not yet modeled from a lifetime perspective. This research will also analyze how a multi-year approach alters measures of poverty among the elderly. Finally, this research extends a micro-simulation model of the Social Security system to incorporate some limited behavioral responses."
