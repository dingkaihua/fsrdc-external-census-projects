abstract: "This research project expands current statistics by developing series that describe inequality at the level of occupations and geographic areas. While the evolution of inequality is often measured and analyzed as a macroeconomic phenomenon, this project uses geographic and occupational variations to attempt to gain insight into its underlying causes. The theories examined emphasize economic channels through which inequality driven by “superstar” effects can spill over into occupations in which the superstar phenomenon is not directly applicable."
