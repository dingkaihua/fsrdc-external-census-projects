abstract: "A central tenet of U.S. corporate governance is that management should maximize shareholder value. However, as is now well-understood, shareholder maximization may impose costs on other stakeholders, including creditors and employees, that may not be internalized by shareholders. While there is recent evidence that the conflicts between shareholders and creditors—and even conflicts of interest among different classes of creditors—can have large impacts on corporate policies, there exists limited research analyzing precisely how these conflicts influence resource (mis)allocation in the economy. The purpose of this research is to conduct a micro-level analysis that documents how creditor control and borrower-lender relationships influence the investment, employment, and asset redeployment decisions, as well as employees of borrowing firms in (or in close proximity to) financial distress. The Census of Manufactures, Annual Survey of Manufactures, Longitudinal Business Database, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, Quarterly Financial Report, Auxiliary Establishment Survey, and Standard Statistical Establishment List will be used to quantify the effect of credit markets on individual firm behavior and performance, as well as worker earnings. We examine the influence of these conflicts on real activity and employees using two financial distress events that afford creditors greater control over corporate decision-making: bankruptcy and covenant violations (“technical default”). We complement these “ex post” analyses of creditor control with an “ex ante” analysis of The 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act—a major piece of legislation that strengthened shareholders’ rights relative to creditors.
