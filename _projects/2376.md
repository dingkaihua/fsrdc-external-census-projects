abstract: "Federal and state governments create place-based policies to reduce the concentration of poverty and to improve the status of high poverty neighborhoods. Some evidence suggests that these policies improve the economic status of the targeted neighborhoods relative to similar poor neighborhoods, whether these gains persist once the programs are removed remains an open question. This project examines the funding expiration of Renewal Communities in 2009 and the effect of this termination on residents and workers in Renewal Communities on outcomes such as wages, employment, hours worked, industry employed, family income, public assistance income, and housing values. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design where Renewal Communities are the treatment group and Empowerment Zones are the comparison group, we study this question using restricted 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census and the 2001-2017 American Community Survey (ACS). The restricted data allow us to identify census tracts where individuals live and/or work in, as the placed-based policies are determined at the census tract level. Understanding the lasting impact of place-based policies once they expire is important for policy makers to know whether these programs temporarily or permanently lift communities out of poverty."
