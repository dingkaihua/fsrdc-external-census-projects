abstract: "Using the LEHD and ACS data, this project explores firm-level wage compression, a practice in which lower productivity workers are paid more while higher productivity workers are paid less. This research will document how prevalent wage compression is in the U.S. economy, as well as the relationship between wage compression and the cyclical properties of nominal wages and the recent trends in earnings inequality. For example, wage compression within the firm may be related to the cyclical properties of the labor market if firms with more wage compression are more attune to fairness concerns and, therefore, are less likely to drop their wages in response to negative economic shocks. Furthermore, if there are differences in wage compression across firms, high ability workers will likely want to sort into the firms with less wage compression, and lower ability individuals will want to sort into higher wage compression firms where they are paid more. These incentives will lead to an increase in the sorting of workers across firms over time. Additionally, it may be that firms share their profits with workers, and that, because of fairness concerns, the firm shares the economic profits with all of its workers. Wage compression within the firm, therefore, affects how much differences in profits across firms can explain the rise in between-firm wage variability, even for people at the bottom of the skill distribution."
