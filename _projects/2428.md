abstract: "Preliminary work with data from American Housing Survey (AHS) PUF sample suggests that the difference between low- and high-quality housing units in some metropolitan areas is small.  With these results as our motivating base, we aim to use housing and occupant  data from American Housing  Survey  IUF  samples  to  conduct  a  more  rigorous  assessment  of  the  quality-to-rent relationship and test two hypotheses that may explain variations in the relationship. First, using the more precise geographical coding of IUF micro-data, we incorporate important spatial unit characteristics and Census demographic data into the hedonic equation that estimates the rent-to-quality schedules.  Using  these  estimates  of  the  relationship,  our  first  hypothesis  examines  the extent to which rental and ownership markets compete. We suspect competition may exist in cities with  more  accessible  ownership  markets  since  landlords  catering  to  renters on  the  margin  of buying a home may have smaller pricing power which results in lower relative rents. Conversely, metros in which the housing market is more expensive, even higher-income households may not have the capacity to enter the owning market so landlords catering to them have more pricing power; hence, higher relative rents. The second hypothesis we examine stems from evidence of potential landlord monopoly power in select neighborhoods. Chiefly, we estimate whether rents in neighborhoods with highly-concentrated unit portfolios are higher than they otherwise should be using  a  hedonic  between  IUF  rents  and  market  concentration  indexes.  To  estimate  market concentrations,  we  utilize  official  tax  and  property  assessor  databases  on  property  ownership. Because  we  presently have  access  to  assessor  databases  for Milwaukee  City and  Los  Angeles County, we perform market concentration analysis in these areas but will expand to other cities or metropolitan areas as more assessor data become available."
