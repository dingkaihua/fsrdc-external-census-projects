abstract: "This research will examine whether the likelihood of reporting material hardships is affected by the relative affluence of oneâ€™s neighbors. We analyze this issue using data from the 2008 panel of the restricted-use version of the Survey of Income and Program (SIPP), where we can identify the neighborhood (census tract) of residence. One of the central aims of the proposed research is to provide information about the prevalence of seven different hardships among the population, and, in addition, how these patterns vary by the characteristics of the neighborhood of residence. This kind of neighborhood-level analysis is novel, and thus represents a unique contribution to our understanding of patterns of material hardship among the U.S. population."
