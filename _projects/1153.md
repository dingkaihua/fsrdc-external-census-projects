abstract: "With the changes in the nature and concept of innovation that the present economic scenario entails, analysis and modeling of the economics of innovation done in the past need re-evaluating. Microdata analysis provides the opportunity to address the relevant issues surrounding innovation with a new metric for innovation, and to learn more about the issue about which we know less: organization of research collaboration strategies among companies and their ability to utilize results of externally performed research. This will shed new light on the variability in innovation across firms. This research will (1) characterize innovation modes of companies in the U.S. and their missing data patterns, (2) model econometrically the relative contribution of organization and collaboration to the industrial differences in innovation rates under alternative scenarios, and (3) study the sensitivity of population estimates to different missing data adjustments and weighting methods."
