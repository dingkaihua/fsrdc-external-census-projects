abstract: "This research examines the demographic, economic and social conditions of Micronesians from the Freely Associated States who live in Hawaii. The U.S. federal government signed a Compact of Free Association [COFA] with these Micronesian nations in the 1980s and 1990s which allowed COFA citizens to live and work in the U.S. without a visa. Media accounts discuss a growing stigma against COFA citizens in Hawaii and their unique immigration status reduces their access to important social services. I ask the following questions: 1) how does the immigration status of COFA migrants inform their housing, employment, poverty, and healthcare outcomes and do these outcomes change during times of significant legislative change that affects access to social services and 2) how does the intersection of structural inequalities based on race, class, gender and migration status shape COFA migrant resource access in Hawaii? Using 1990-2020 Decennial Census and American Community Surveys, I conduct logistic regression analyses to isolate the effect of COFA status on poverty, employment and healthcare access and use the multi-group entropy index and index of net difference to examine patterns of segregation in Honolulu County. Findings support that COFA status is associated with more poverty, lower employment, less healthcare, and that these outcomes worsen over time. Additionally, COFA citizens are increasingly segregated in lower-income areas of Honolulu County. This adds to existing literature by analyzing how immigration status beyond the undocumented/citizen binary influences degrees of exclusion which speaks to broader research on how immigration status affects immigrant incorporation."
