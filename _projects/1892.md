abstract: "In 2007, the Census Bureau began including a question about franchise ownership for a broad range of sectors in the Economic Census. Our research combines the Census of Services (CSR) and the Census of Retail Trade (CRT) with data on the locations of quick-service food establishments to provide a comparison of the Census Bureau franchise data with a reliable outside data source. We also combine the Census Bureau data with information on numerous state franchise regulations. Using an establishment-level, two-stage regression model, we study the relationships between local market characteristics, state franchise laws, establishment franchise status, and outcomes. There are 16 U.S. states that prohibit franchisors from terminating franchisee contracts without “good cause” and 11 states that prohibit cancelation of contract renewal without “good cause.” We test the hypothesis that these laws impose costs of franchising to franchisors and will affect the prevalence of franchised establishments. Next, using information on total sales and employment from the CSR and CRT, we relate franchise status to outcomes, using state franchise regulations as an instrument for franchise status."
