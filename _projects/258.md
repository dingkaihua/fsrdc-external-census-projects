abstract: "The 1998 Annual Capital Expenditure Survey (ACES) is the first micro-level data set to contain information of investment spending broken down into the actual types of capital goods in which firms invest. Part of this project, therefore, will simply be to document the investment behavior of firms in terms of their allocation of capital expenditures across types. In particular, how similar are firms’ investment distributions in total, within-industry, and between-industry. Such an analysis will help researchers determine how representative industry-level capital flows data are of firm-level behavior. I also propose to compare industry-level estimates of the investment distribution from the BEA to those implied by the ACES survey data. Both the documentation of investment patterns and the comparison of the implied industry-level investment distributions to those estimated by the BEA will help determine the value of collecting this detailed investment by type data in ACES and therefore will benefit the Census Bureau. The main purpose of this project, however, will be to measure the individual productivity contributions of various types of capital goods. A large body of empirical research has recently emerged that has found that IT investment, in particular, has a positive contribution to TFP above and beyond the contribution of total capital. The natural question, then, is: are there other capital types that also have “excess” productivity contributions? Matching ACES data to public financial data from Compustat, we can measure output, labor, materials, and total capital and thus construct a conventional measure of total factor productivity (TFP). We can then test for significant relationships between investment shares (i.e. investment in a particular capital types as a share of total investment) and TFP via regression analysis. The coefficients on the investment shares will identify the sign and the magnitude of the excess contributions of each capital type to productivity. This will be of great interest to researchers and decision-makers and therefore will help demonstrate the value of the ACES program."
