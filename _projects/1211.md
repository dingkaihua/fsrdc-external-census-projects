abstract: "As arctic residents confront accelerating global forces of change, researchers and decision makers face a huge loss of information on adaptation and social outcomes. For instance, have social and economic conditions for Alaska Natives living in a given community changed since 2000? Do current conditions differ from one community or small region to another? During the past several decades, such questions could be answered by using the published Census Bureau statistics derived from the decennial Census long form survey. Unfortunately, the first American Community Survey (ACS) results published in late 2010 for rural Alaska communities exhibit a large downgrade in reliability compared to decennial Census data. Margins of error for many indicators are so high that conditions in one rural Alaska Census Area, let alone community, often cannot be distinguished statistically from those in another. This project meets this critical emerging information need by developing a set of statistically more robust social indicators for rural Alaska communities from the ACS and other sources. It takes advantage of the increased statistical power of the new indicators to test hypotheses about spatial differences and recent change in arctic social conditions that cannot be tested reliably with the published figures. The project will provide estimates and analysis to improve ACS estimates, reproducible methods for updating the indicator set periodically as new data became available over time, and recommendations for highest priority collection of new observations."
