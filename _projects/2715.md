abstract: "We aim to investigate the role of labor market power in determining firms' cost of capital and response to interest rate shocks. We hypothesize that firms with higher labor market power (1) have lower cost of capital, and (2) respond more aggressively to negative interest rate shocks. We plan to merge Census Bureau data with Compustat/CRSP to investigate these hypotheses. Confirmation of these hypotheses will deepen our understanding of the determinants of firms' cost of capital and the economic effects of interest rate shocks."
