abstract: "We are interested in studying the labor market outcomes of college graduates. Specifically, we want to focus on how labor market outcomes vary by the selectivity of the college attended and college major (i.e type of college graduate). We will document differences across type of college graduate in the mean, growth and volatility of earnings in early- mid- and late-career. We will also analyze the extent to which outcomes vary geographically or have changed across college graduate cohorts. We will next analyze the sources of heterogenous labor market outcomes including the a worker's employer, the tasks performed on the job and
occupation. We will study the effect of local labor market conditions at time of graduation on a variety of short- and long-term labor market outcomes including earnings, employment, occupation, migration decisions and employer characteristics.

To accomplish this, restricted Census data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, Decennial Census, American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) and the UMETRICS University Research Data (UMT) will be linked together. The specific LEHD data sets being requested in this proposal include: Employer Characteristics Files (ECF), Employment History Files (EHF), Geocoded Address List (GAL), Individual Characteristics Files (ICF), Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and Unit-to-Worker (U2W). Additionally, PI-supplied data will include area-level measures of labor markets, institution-level information on for U.S. post-secondary institutions, occupation-level descriptors and publicly available measures of average earnings by college attended and
college major."
