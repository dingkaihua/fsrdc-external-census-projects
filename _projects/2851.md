abstract: "Natural disasters are often said to create winners and losers due to their redistributive effect. Part of this redistribution may occur in the context of firm dynamics--an inherent feature of Schumpeterian creative destruction and of reallocation and growth. Yet, little is known about how (much) exactly natural disasters--exogenous yet powerful forces of destruction--affect firm dynamics, and how federal assistance factors into this process. Our research project aims to address this gap. Our preliminary work using publicly accessible data finds that US counties which experience at least one natural disaster see a pronounced increase in the number of new startups and a very small drop in the total number of businesses within the same year. Moreover, our analyses using the Small Business Administration's disaster assistance data show that disaster loans to businesses are associated with a substantial increase in new business formation, primarily by non-employer businesses. These preliminary results warrant further, detailed inquiry into the impact of disasters on broader business dynamics. Thus, we seek to combine restricted economic data from the US Census Bureau with disaster records from various sources to produce novel estimates of the impact of natural disasters on the number, survival, and productivity of startups and businesses in the US, to describe the heterogeneity and mechanisms of these impacts, as well as to examine the role of federal assistance in recovery. Examining a unique phenomenon at the nexus of disasters and business and labor dynamics, this research agenda stands to contribute meaningfully to the literature on firm dynamics as well as that on the economics of disasters, reallocation, and inequality. Since the frequency and/or intensity of various disasters is expected to increase with climate change, it can also provide policy-relevant insight on disaster management and community resilience."
