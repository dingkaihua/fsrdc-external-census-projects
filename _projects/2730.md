abstract: "With increasing technological advancements, firms are now more capable of reducing labor share through automation, especially among low-skill labor. Minimum wages and unions increase bottom bounds on wage distributions. Using the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), Annual Business Survey (ABS), Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Data (LFTTD), Survey of Manufacturing Technology (SMT), and Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) from the U.S. Census Bureau in conjunction with data on minimum wage laws and union coverage (UC Berkeley Labor Center Minimum Wage Inventory, US Department of Labor State Minimum Wage Laws, Union Membership and Coverage Database, and CPS MORG), I explore the impact of wage floors on technological adoption, capital expenditures, and employment among different firm sizes and industries. I first provide summary statistics and graphical output, which will provide insights into decisions made by firms of different sizes and industries. I then estimate wage floor impact on technological adoption by regression, using imports, capital expenditures, and employment to construct measures of adoption. The estimates and summary measures are important for understanding wage floor policies' impacts on the already increasing trend in automation, and they will also be utilized in a theoretical model in later work to connect the impact on technological adoption with other connected decisions, such as entry and exit, labor decisions, and wages. My hypothesis is that an increase in the wage floor will increase automation of labor overall, but the increase will be higher for larger firms that face less strict constraints."
