abstract: "This study addresses the role that public housing developments play in labor market processes. This association will be particularly examined in the New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner, Louisiana metropolitan area before and after Hurricane Katrina for three separate outcomes: employment status, occupational concentration, and job earnings. Restricted-use Census microdata from 2000 and 2006-2009 will be utilized, together with public housing data and a raster dataset measuring the extent of Katrina flooding, to partially control for physical damage from the storm. Both individual- and neighborhood-level variables will be incorporated into a series of hierarchical linear models, allowing for these variables of different scales to be incorporated into the same model."
