abstract: "We propose a study of the impact of highways on productivity and investment based on Census micro data. The study will produce state-level policy-relevant estimates of economic development benefits of highways, will help to resolve and reconcile some of the conflicting results in the literature, and will provide impact estimates with more geographic detail than currently available. In particular:
* We will use Census micro data on manufacturing establishments to estimate productivity effects in cross section or cross-section-time series framework. Previous studies have pointed out the extreme sensitivity of productivity estimates to the choice of time-series assumptions; the micro data approach may allow us to improve upon their estimates. 
* We will also use the micro data to estimate the determinants of investment location. We will develop a nested multinomial logit model within which cost-minimizing firms choose a location for investment based on input prices at the location, transportation costs, and other location-specific factors."
