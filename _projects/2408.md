abstract: "Suicide is a major public health problem especially in rural areas, where suicide rates are over fives time higher than urban areas and increasing more rapidly. This project will examine suicide rates and risk factors for individuals and communities in rural parts of the United States. We will use individual data from the American Community Survey and suicide data from the National Center of Health Statistics to produce and analyze a single dataset in a case-control  design. Additional variables related to the county of residence will also be included to examine contextual factors related to risk of suicide. Statistical analyses will include overall rates of suicide and random effects regression models to identify individual and contextual factors associated with suicide, overall and by demographic groups, in rural counties. We expect our results to show that rural areas with higher levels of socioeconomic distress and fewer community engagement opportunities will have higher suicide risks. We also expect to identify adult, white males to have higher risk of suicide, especially via firearms. This project is the first to focus on rural areas and combine living controls with suicide decedents to identify risk factors for demographic groups within these areas. It will highlight important groups of people to target for suicide prevention along with community factors that can be addressed to help reduce suicide risk in rural areas."
