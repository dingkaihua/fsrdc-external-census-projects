abstract: "Global trading activity has shifted modalities steadily from the exchange of goods used for final consumption towards globally integrated production networks that exchange goods used as intermediate inputs. Currently, evidence and analysis regarding the end-use of traded goods relies on characterizations that are available only for broad product categories, ad hoc in their characterization of goods, out of date, and not specific to U.S. economic activities. This research implements a new classification of end-use categories for traded goods that (i) characterizes end-use according to observed economic activity among U.S. firms, and (ii) measures the shares of import activity across sub-populations of different end-users for a wide variety of products. This project will identify firms in retail versus production sectors of the economy from the Longitudinal Business Database, and then classify imports by firms in retail sectors (production sectors) as having an end-use as consumption goods (intermediate goods). This strategy accounts for the fact that two different types of firms may import the same product for different end-uses. Measuring differences in end-uses of traded goods is key to identifying the determinants of import demand, and subsequently to understanding how exchange rate shocks pass-through to consumer prices, how aggregate import demand characteristics have changed over time, and how U.S. consumers and firms engage with the global economy."
