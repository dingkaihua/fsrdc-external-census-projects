abstract: "This project will examine a range of probabilistic multiple file matching procedures using the data sources provided by Census. These methods consider sets of records from different files simultaneously, utilizing all available information in order to estimate the probability that the various subsets of these records correspond to the same person. The results from these file matching techniques will be compared to results from current Census Bureau file matching practices."
