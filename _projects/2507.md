abstract: "The objective of  this project is to facilitate the study of assisted housing effects on healthy child development by statistically cross-walking the nationally representative Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)-Assisted Housing Database (AHD) with the American Housing Survey using model-based imputation methods.  Doing so will substantially enrich the PSID with measures of housing and neighborhood conditions, thereby allowing achievement of the broader goal of the more robust examination of the role of assisted housing in children's developmental outcomes than has been possible to date. Outcomes of interest are three aspects of healthy development--cognitive development, social-emotional development and several dimensions of health such as psychological distress. There are three main hypotheses to explain assisted housing effects: improved housing affordability, improved housing conditions, and improved neighborhood conditions. The PSID-AHD allows us (and other analysts) to follow a nationally representative sample of children younger than 18 who lived in assisted housing into adulthood and compare their outcomes to similar children who were eligible for but did not live in assisted housing."
