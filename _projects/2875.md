abstract: "This project will use the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) system to link restricted-use SNAP and WIC micro-level administrative datasets to the 2000 Decennial Census, 2010 Decennial Census, 2005-present American Community Survey (ACS), and the Social Security Administration Numident file. Summarizing this project's activities, after initial data linkages, we will develop descriptive analysis on the relationship between SNAP distribution dates and labor market and health outcomes. Then, this project will leverage program eligibility cutoffs for SNAP, and program policy variation in SNAP-Ed to causally identify the effect of SNAP/WIC on labor market (e.g., employment and income) and health outcomes (e.g., hospitalization and mortality). Despite the restricted-use micro-level SNAP/WIC datasets being non-comprehensive in terms of state-year coverage, we have identified several examples of program administration variation (with the state-years available) that we can leverage to estimate causal effects. For the sake of this proposal, we highlight a limited number of examples of SNAP and WIC administration variation that we will exploit for both descriptive and causal analyses. Specifically, we are interested in (1) variation in SNAP distribution dates and in certification period length, (2) variation in employment and age eligibility requirements, and (3) variation in SNAP-Ed program implementation. With (2), for example, some states reduce work requirements for individuals over 50, so we will compare otherwise-similar SNAP-participating households across the 50-year-old threshold to examine the effects of dropping the work requirement on employment (and other labor market and health outcomes). For WIC, we will conduct an analogous comparison based on the 5-year-old cutoff for children granting eligibility. Additionally, variation in certification periods will allow us to exploit the differential timing of reductions in SNAP benefits occurring from shorter recertification periods, rather than other unobserved factors. This will facilitate a powerful descriptive analysis, and we will explore the potential for estimating the causal effect of changes in SNAP benefit amounts resulting from the differential timing of recertification. Furthermore, the extensive longitudinal micro-level linkages will facilitate the examination of specific mechanisms for observed effects, such as educational attainment, family formation, migration, and hospitalization, all of which are testable."
