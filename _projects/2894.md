abstract: "Hiring strategies in the U.S. food processing industry have played an important role in attracting new international and domestic migration to rural counties, creating new immigrant and Latino communities in many rural places. The food processing industry has been affected by multiple crises in the past two decades: food processing facilities saw some of the first major disease outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have also been the site of numerous large-scale immigration enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This proposal details a national-level study of demographic patterns in U.S. counties where food processing is a major employer, in order to identify possible effects of these crisis events. Specifically, I will use multilevel and difference-in-difference models to examine the effects of COVID-19 outbreaks and worksite immigration enforcement actions on employment and wages in the food processing industry, on county-level migration patterns, on women's fertility choices, and on ACS participation and nonresponse. In order to complete the project, I request access to restricted use ACS and Longitudinal Business Database files, which I will merge with publicly available data and a research-created county-level database of COVID-19 outbreaks and DHS immigration enforcement actions."
