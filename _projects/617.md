abstract: "Economists have noted that the quality of imputed data is a problem for researchers using plant-level Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) and Census of Manufactures data. Using the detailed item impute ﬂags in the later years of the ASM, this project proposes to develop a model of missing data by applying methods of multiple imputation to improve imputations for nonresponse in these data. The research will measure improvement in data quality by analyzing how both aggregate and plant-level productivity, as well as other measures, are diﬀerent with multiply imputed data versus the methods currently in use by the Census Bureau."
