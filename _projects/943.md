abstract: "This project proposes three interconnected research tasks that taken together will contribute to an integrated approach for identifying individual owner, establishment, industrial, and regional determinants that affect performance of small businesses in the United States. Specifically, the project will examine the impact that business assistance programs have on employment and revenue growth for small employers across all sectors of the economy. Two types of business assistance programs available during the 1992-1997 time period will be assessed:

o 	privately-run, business incubation programs designed to aid entrepreneurs by providing various business support services and resources, and
o 	the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program run by the Small Business Administration to provide research and development funds to small, high-tech, innovative businesses.

In conducting this research, this project will not only inform the Census Bureau about factors that affect small business performance but will also improve the understanding of the Census Bureau's data on these small businesses by conducting comparisons of the external data elements to the internal data to find discrepancies between the data sources and to determine if there are patterns in missing elements of the internal data.  Data elements within the Census in-house data sources and among the Census in-house and external sources will be cross-checked and cross-validated. Consequently, missing and inconsistent data elements in Title 13, Chapter 5 data will be identified to increase the understanding of the quality of data. Additionally, a methodology will be developed to estimate non-response for a Title 13, Chapter 5 program. The proposed research will focus on answering these key questions related to small business performance:
o 	Which key characteristics of individual owners, establishments, firms, industries, and the local region significantly affect small businesses' performance? 
o 	Do small business assistance programs - specifically, business incubation programs and the SBIR program - affect small businesses' performance, and do they enhance the effects of those key characteristics found to significantly affect small businesses' performance?
o 	Do the effects of these small business assistance programs vary across industries and locations?"
