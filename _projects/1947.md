abstract: "Economists are increasingly applying spatial analyses to economic questions, with most researchers applying these methods to publicly-available, aggregate data. However, there is strong evidence to believe that these analyses produce biased results when the unit of aggregation does not match the spatial scale of the phenomenon under study. We seek to document how the use of spatially aggregated data can bias conclusions in economic impact studies of energy development by combining disaggregated Census data containing detailed location and production information with external wind, oil, and gas industry data. From these linked data, we hope to produce new, unbiased estimates of the economic impact of new energy development investments on local economies, for different types of industries."
