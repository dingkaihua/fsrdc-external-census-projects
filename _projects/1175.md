abstract: "Substantial debate surrounds the effects of government-determined factors such as minimum wages, unemployment insurance (UI), trade protections, and place-based economic development programs. Moreover, what researchers observe in observational data frequently runs counter to theoretical predictions from standard economic models. Recent work suggests that publicly available data from surveys may mask important micro-heterogeneity and obscure differential impacts across local labor markets. We match employee-employer data from the Census Bureauâ€™s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program to uncover such micro-heterogeneity as we examine how minimum wages, UI, trade protections, and place-based economic development programs affect the functioning of the labor market."
