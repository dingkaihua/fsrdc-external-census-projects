abstract: "This project will examine service sector data, focusing on new firm entries. Evaluate the completeness and apparent accuracy (partially judged by consistency over time) of initial industry and geographic coding from the SSEL.  It will analyze survival patterns of single-employee new firms versus multi-employee new firms.  It will also analyze probable predecessors of apparent large new firms, especially those in the rapidly growing employee-leasing business. Extract data on credible new service firms and their older competitors, for each year from 1990 to 1997, for each of 394 Labor Market Areas, and aggregate into 6-8 subsectors, based on their primary market.  Distinguishing seasoned startups (surviving at least 3 years) from failed startups, estimate models (using publicly available socioeconomic data) to help explain regional differences in startup rates, survival rates, and employment growth rates."
