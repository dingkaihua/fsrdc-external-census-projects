abstract: "Disability programs in the United States are large and expanding rapidly. While there has been substantial research on how these programs affect the labor supply of individual recipients, there is less evidence on how they affect outcomes beyond labor supply, or how they affect communities as a whole, in addition to individual recipients. This project uses all years of the American Community Survey (starting from 1996), as well as the 1990, 2000, and 2010 decennial Censuses, along with quasi-experimental variation from the closings of Social Security field offices, to estimate the effect of disability receipt on the economic and social outcomes of communities, including demographics, employment, housing stability, program participation, health, and crime, at the census tract level. The effect of disability receipt on individuals may differ from the effect on communities because of peer effects or spillovers. "
