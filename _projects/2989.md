abstract: "The gap in labor market outcomes between college and non-college graduates has been widening since the 1970s. Employer-provided health insurance may uniquely contribute to increasing labor market inequality in the U.S. Employer contributions to health insurance act as a "head tax", a uniform fixed cost for every worker hired, and increase the price of non-college graduates relative to college graduates. Using matched employer-employee Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data linked to employer contributions data in the Form 5500s and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) data, we study the effect of employer-provided health insurance on the employment and wages of college and non-college graduates within firms. We use an instrumental variables (IV) approach, using the responsiveness of firms to tax incentives for premium contributions, hospital mergers, and health insurer mergers as instruments for employer contributions to health insurance. We test our hypotheses that rising employer premiums have lowered the employment and relative wages of non-college graduates, relative to college graduates."
