abstract: "This project will examine the housing, neighborhood, and housing market conditions of families with children living in federally assisted housing compared with similar families with children who do not receive housing assistance. Analysis will include difference in means across major subgroups (e.g., family size, income), and multivariate analysis predicting housing, neighborhood, and market characteristics of the assisted and unassisted samples separately to test whether there are differences in predictors of these outcomes. We will also test models that pool the assisted and unassisted groups to observe whether living in assisted housing has a large and significant effect on housing, neighborhood, and housing market outcomes."
