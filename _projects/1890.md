abstract: "Over the course of the 20th century and continuing today, U.S. regions have experienced massive shifts to the geographic distribution of economic activity. In this research, we will seek to answer the following three questions: (1) How can we better catalogue these changes in the location of economic activity and industrial networks over the past half-century? (2) To what extent have changes in transportation costs, productivity spillovers, production networks, or exposure to international trade contributed to this reallocation and to regional divergence? (3) How have forces specifically internal to the firm contributed to regional reallocation? We will obtain establishment-level employment data and geographic information from the Longitudinal Business Database. Sales data from the Census of Manufactures, in conjunction with Commodity Flows Survey, will be used to produce causally identified industry-year estimates of agglomeration forces. "
