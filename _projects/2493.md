abstract: "This project will estimate the later-life impacts of public investments in early education and private high school dropout decisions during the teenage years. We will exploit variation across cohorts and counties in policy and economic shocks to explore two respective questions: (1) What are the later-life impacts of public investments in universal early education, and how do they vary by local characteristics at likely time of exposure? (2) How do educational choices respond to local labor market conditions during one's teenage years, both in the short- and long-term? 

To address these questions, we will link internal demographic Census data to cohort-by-place-of-birth varying measures of exposure to universal early education (spanning the 1960s to the 1990s) and local economic circumstances stemming from the highly localized spread of fracking in the 2000s. We will also merge in data at the state, county, state-by-cohort, or county-by-cohort level as necessary to implement and test the robustness of our proposed research designs.

The project will estimate average and heterogenous long-term effects of universal preschool in the U.S. by way of variation over space and time in early education funding, from two distinct periods of state and local investment - the 1960s-1970s and 1990s. The project will further explore whether the fracking's recent negative impact on high school completion of teenage boys has been sustained as the relevant cohorts have aged into adulthood, and the extent to which, on net, their employment, earnings, and participation in public assistance in adulthood have been affected."
