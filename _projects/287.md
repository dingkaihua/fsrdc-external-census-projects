abstract: "Mounting evidence that similar individuals residing in different places have varying life chances has given rise to the possibility that racially-segregated urban environments have a particularly insidious impact on the health of African American residents of high poverty urban areas. However, observed geographic patterning of health outcomes might also reflect systematic health-related migration across local residential areas -- for example, the in- or out- migration of the most or least healthy residents into high poverty urban areas. Research on this issue is scant because few data sets link health and migration. 
Our primary goal is to test the hypothesis that selective health-related migration affects geographic variations in local population health. To do so, we will need to analyze confidential data from responses to the Census question that asks respondents to the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses where they resided 5 years earlier. Thus, for our work at the Research Data Center, we propose to use the Sample Edited Detail File (SEDF) of the 1990 Decennial Census, and the similar data from the 2000 census when it becomes available. The SEDF represents roughly 16% of the population and includes all the long-form records including the critical question on prior residence that is not available on the public use files released by the Census Bureau. Of benefit to the Bureau, this project will improve understanding of the quality of Census data and improve Census-based estimates of local population health. Should we find that health related migration biases estimates of population health, this will identify shortcomings of current data collection and document new data collection needs. By estimating disability rates for select high poverty and minority populations, taking selective health-related migration into account, we will provide more accurate estimates of the health status of these local populations than currently exist. In addition, our study will shed light on the feasibility of using the Census to study short distance moves and will enable us to determine the extent and nature of missing data on relevant items. If our results support the value of using detailed geography when studying migration patterns, it would suggest that, subject to other considerations, the Census might consider including more detailed geographic information, such as census tract of prior residence, in the data released for use at Research Data Centers, so that investigators do not have to rely on “county” or census “place” of prior residence."
