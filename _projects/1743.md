abstract: "This project examines the effects of public health programs, particularly those that improved access to prenatal care and early life health care. Outcome variables are from the 2000-2018 American Community Survey, linked with state and county of birth by year of birth measures of exposure to public health programs. This study will shed new light on the population who experienced these programs, the effectiveness of these programs, and the suitability of public-use data for measuring exposure to public health programs relative to the restricted-use data."
