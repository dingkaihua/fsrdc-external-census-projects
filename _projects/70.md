abstract: "This proposal describes a project that will examine the accuracy of measurement of dynamic labor market behavior in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The key feature of the project is the use of longitudinal records from the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system and the MEDS (Medicaid Eligibility Database System) of the State of California to provide accurate information on welfare, employment, unemployment, and earnings outcomes of individuals in the Census surveys. The project will link individual records from California residents in the SIPP with UI base wage records and records from the stateâ€™s MEDS file, and use the combined data set to address a series of questions related to the welfare-to-work transition of former welfare recipients. The combined data set will also be used to examine the divergence in measures of employment and earnings derived from household surveys compared to the known events contained in administrative files. Recent initiatives at the federal level, and subsequent state welfare legislation, have focused renewed attention on the ability of existing Census survey data to track trends in program participation and measure changes in welfare-to-work. Further, at a time when the State of California has grown faster, but started at a later date than other states, there are questions over the stability of jobs that individuals leaving welfare might receive. The proposed research seeks to address a number of issues in examining economic problems relating to welfare-to-work and the construction of matched employer employee data. As well as providing evidence on important questions, there will be substantial scientific contributions from the work (that enhance and identify shortcomings in Census Chapter13, Title 5 data programs). The scientific questions to be addressed concern the representative quality of the matched data once it has been formed and a means to address issues in the Census data such as measurement error and attrition bias. This work builds the research in earlier work conducted at the CCRDC. The main purpose of this work is to use data that has already been linked by the Linked Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) project to combine this SIPP-UI linked data with another administrative data source to examine how various models perform using matched data. As part of our method, we are performing quality checks on Census data that are outside the LEHD task list and complement their data program, and the mission of the Census as a whole."
