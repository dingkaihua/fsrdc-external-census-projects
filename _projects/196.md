abstract: "This study will evaluate the impact of the Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) on the labor force behavior of men. I will use two main approaches. First, I will follow Bound (1989) using a more current dataset, with more complete information on rejected SSDI applicants. This technique will produce a more precise upper bound on the elasticity of SSDI participation. Second, in addition to providing an upper bound, I will adopt a quasi-experimental approach to provide a point estimate of the impact for an important sub-sample of applicants: those whose eligibility is based in part on vocational factors. More specifically, with data on rejected as well as accepted SSDI applicants, I will be able to exploit the idiosyncrasies of the Social Security Administrationâ€™s Disability Determination Process. I will be able to show that the SSDI participation rule fits within a quasi-experimental design framework that has recently gained significant attention in the economics literature: the Regression Discontinuity Design. The data that will be used are the 1990-1996 panels of SIPP exact matched to the Social Security Disability Determination 831 file. Creation of this new dataset will enhance the reach of the SIPP data in three ways. First, by matching the SIPP to Social Security data, I will obtain a more accurate measure of SSDI participation than available in the SIPP. Second, I will be to study the accuracy of and relationships between self-reported SSDI benefit receipt, health measures and disability status in the SIPP. And third, I will be able to compare the level of mis-reporting across all five panels of the SIPP."
