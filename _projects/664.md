abstract: "This project employs data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) to examine the current location and well-being of residents of New Orleans in the year after Hurricane Katrina struck the city. The aims of this project are to describe the return or resettlement in the year following Hurricane Katrina of people who resided in New Orleans before the storm and to examine the well-being of the pre-Katrina New Orleans population in the year after the hurricane, compared to a matched population from the prior year. The ACS data provide a unique opportunity to examine the geographic dispersion of New Orleans residents throughout the United States in the after-math of Hurricane Katrina and to assess several important dimensions of well-being. This project addresses a number of unanswered research questions about the eﬀects of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans’ population. It also explores the strengths and weaknesses of the ACS data for examining the eﬀects of Hurricane Katrina and for future studies of the effects of large-scale natural and man-made disasters. The researchers will evaluate the suitability of propensity-score reweighting techniques for studying these topics using the ACS by, for example, examining which population groups are underrepresented and overrepresented between the two ACS cross-sections."
