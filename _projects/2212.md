abstract: "This paper studies gentrification at the block or block group level, using restricted American Community Survey (block group) and Decennial Census (block for 1970-2000, block group for2010) data linked to other block or block group level datasets available publicly. The block-level data will be used to estimate a quantitative general equilibrium new geography model, which will pin down what kind of shocks or "changes" are most important in explaining the gentrification patterns we see in cities today, and how large a role heterogeneous agents and/or agglomeration effects play in these patterns. In order to capture the empirically-observed rich spatial variation between small geographic units, using block or block group level data is critical. Moreover, the block-level data can be used to disentangle the competing results of micro- and macro-level studies of gentrification. Micro-level studies typically feature a narrative of displacement whereas macro-level studies find no significant displacement effect. Reconciling these findings by using micro-level data in a macro-level model which can aggregate results will also be an important contribution to the literature."
