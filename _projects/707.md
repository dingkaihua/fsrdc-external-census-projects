abstract: "Reallocation can take several forms, such as greater investment in more productive plants, entry of plants using a newer technology such as mini-mills, or exit of plants exposed to international trade. Economists care about reallocation at the plant level because of its role in generating improvement in aggregate productivity. In contrast to previous work on reallocation, this project will explicitly model the forward-looking choices of firms. When a firm decides to open a new ready-mix concrete plant, or shut down a steel mill because of foreign competition, it does so because itâ€™s expectation of the net present value of profits are greater than the cost of either shutting down the plant or opening a new one. This project is composed of several separate subprojects designed to look at the forward-looking choices made by firms in different industries and how these generate reallocation. Changes in the ownership of establishments and establishing longitudinal links for firms over time will be used to evaluate the quality of the Master Business Register. The proposed analysis of changes in productivity will inform the quality of measurement of inputs and outputs in the economic census. In addition, several new estimates will be produced that relate to measurement error in productivity and the economic mechanisms driving reallocation of production towards more efficient units. This study will document the role of reallocation and entry and exit in shaping the productivity dispersion in the ready-mix concrete sector, as well as the role of measurement error of output and inputs in economic census questionnaires. Changes in the ownership of plants will be examined to identify the quality of Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) in census data. Since multi-plant ownership is associated with lower exit rates, the ownership of plants matters. This project will provide insight into the decision of firms to sell off assets, as well as the entry and exit decisions of firms rather than plants. It will analyze the effect of trade on plants in the textile and steel sectors. These sectors have been exposed to substantial changes in the strength of international competition over the last 30 years, due principally to the elimination of tariffs and quotas. This analysis will shed light on how the trade environment affected the speed of reallocation of resources such as employment and physical capital across plants in these sectors of the economy and whether this resulted in aggregate productivity gains. Prices of imported steel and textiles will permit the researchers to decompose changes in sales to changes in both the price and quantity produced."
