abstract: "Despite significant advances in the literature on immigration and crime, as well as several noteworthy findings, critical areas of inquiry remain. Extending prior research that often lumps all immigrants together and neglects important differences across groups, this project will distinguish between immigrant composition based on race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and country of origin. We will create novel conceptualizations of immigrant neighborhoods. Furthermore, the project will take into account the macro context in which this immigration occurs--that is, characteristics of the broader city and county context, as well as immigration-related policies and practices--and assess whether this moderates these relationships. Combining public use crime data aggregated to census tracts with restricted access data housed at the RDC will allow us to construct measures of immigrant concentration based on household-level data that is localized at the neighborhood (census tract) level on ancestry, income, and citizenship status (i.e., the American Community Survey). To account for the fact that only a subset of criminal actions are reported to police, we will also use geocoded information available on the restricted National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to identify factors associated with individual-level reporting of crime to local law enforcement. We will also use the RDC data to construct measures of neighborhood inequality based on household-level survey data (e.g., American Community Survey, Decennial Census). The analyses will use data from a variety of sources over many years (2000-2016), allowing us to refine and advance our understanding of the immigration-crime relationship. One set of analyses will examine the immigration-crime relationship focusing on differences among immigrants based on citizenship status, reason or motive for migration, and level of assimilation. Another set of analyses will provide an alternative conceptualization and operationalization of immigrant neighborhoods. A third set of analyses will consider the extent to which the broader city-context of reception as well as immigration-related policies and practices condition the immigration-crime relationship."
