abstract: "We examine the effect of firm financing on firm development, performance, and entry and exit. This central question to corporate finance has been largely examined for public firms, but less studied for private firms due to data constraints. Using confidential Census microdata and various shocks to firm financing from lenders (in the form of traditional lending like the SBA 504 or 7(a) program), venture capital funds, and private equity funds, we provide a coherent picture of firms' financing and how this affects their life cycle. Additionally, we measure how firm financing affects market power. While market power may be driven by multiple sources, we hypothesize that financing scarcity may boost established firms' market power by preventing entry. Lastly, we examine the rise in earning inequality through the lens of market power. Specifically, we look at firm wages and the impact regulatory costs have on firms. We hypothesize that regulatory costs disproportionately hurt small firms driving a rise in market power and greater income inequality."
