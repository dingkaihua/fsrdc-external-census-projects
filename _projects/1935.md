abstract: "This research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the change in U.S. income inequality and labor market dynamics by characterizing the nation’s income distribution using an innovative set of distributional forms, namely a mixture model with a finite number of components. We use data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to construct fine-grained, highly populated frequency histograms that allow us to estimate a multicomponent statistical model of the income distribution, which better capture the three generative processes that prior researchers have speculated shape the income distribution. Findings will identify the crucial characteristics of each of these processes and inform empirically-based theorizations of different modalities of income appropriation. This will ultimately cast light on the occurrence and consequences of unemployment or partial engagement with labor markets, segmentation and stratification in labor markets, and the relationship between functional and individual income.
