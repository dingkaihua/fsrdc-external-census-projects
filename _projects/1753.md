abstract: "The primary goal of this project is to examine the interplay between the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and demand for services (such as local food pantries or soup kitchens) provided by the nonprofit sector. I am interested in examining two questions. The first will study the extent to which changes in the work requirement for SNAP eligibility affects the demand for services provided by non-government providers. In other words, does access to SNAP crowd-out the private provision of public goods? The work requirement affects the population of able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD), who must work at least 20 hours a week or participate in state-sponsored job training in order to receive benefits. If these requirements are not met, they are only eligible to receive benefits for 3 months in a 36-month period. Additionally, I am interested in exploring how this relation varies across an individualâ€™s access to supermarkets and local food pantries. 
Second, I will explore is whether a negative shock to charitable giving affected the local use of public assistance (i.e.. SNAP) and food insecurity. This second question builds on results found in Bottan and Perez-Truglia (2015) who find that a negative shock to religious participation decreased charitable giving and in turn reduced their provision of public goods (measured by employment in service providers). Using data from the CPS, I will be able to go a step further in this analysis and quantify whether the negative shock affected demand for SNAP and food insecurity."
