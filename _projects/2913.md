abstract: "Food insecurity is surprisingly common in the US; 10-15% of households experience food insecurity in any given year. But little is known about household food insecurity dynamics, i.e., whether food insecurity is an outcome that households experience only transitorily, for short periods of time, or a more chronic state and for which households food insecurity is chronic versus transitory. We use a new synthetic panel estimation method (Dang et al. 2014), a data-driven approach to estimate dynamics when we cannot directly observe the same households over many time periods (as in panel data).  We adapt the existing method to the rotating panel sampling design in the Current Population Survey, in particular its Food Security Supplements (CPS-FSS). We generate a new food insecurity dynamics measure we developed, the probability of food security (PFS, Lee et al. 2022), by comparing observed household food expenditures to the food expenditures needed to avoid food insecurity, as reflected in the USDA's Cost of the Thrifty Food Plan estimates. Combining the new method and measure permits us to estimate indicators of food insecurity dynamics among US households from 2000-2021. Specifically, we will estimate the prevalence of short-run, transitory food insecurity and of long-run, chronic food insecurity. We will estimate spell lengths for periods of food insecurity and the share of the food insecure who are chronically versus transitorily, food insecure, in both national and state-specific samples. We will establish which household attributes are most strongly associated with persistent versus transitory food insecurity, versus consistent food security."
