abstract: "For a large, nationally representative cross-section of individuals, the 1990 Census Content Reinterview Survey (1990 CRS) collects unique and valuable information on the national origins of the respondents’ ancestors. With this information, immigrant generation and national origins can be directly and precisely assigned for each respondent, based on the countries of birth of the respondent’s ancestors, even for those respondents whose families have lived in the United States for two or more generations. This project uses the 1990 CRS data to determine the accuracy of standard methods for identifying the later-generation descendants of immigrants and to investigate whether the more precise information available in the CRS changes inferences about the long-term socioeconomic integration of important national origin groups. The 1990 CRS data are ideal for evaluating the potential deficiencies of current methods and improving our understanding of the long-term integration of immigrant groups. "
