abstract: "The U.S. unemployment insurance (UI) program provides temporary monetary benefits to laid off workers, a program that millions of Americans utilize annually. Each state independently administers and finances their own UI program, determining funding schemes, rates, and program generosity within general federal guidelines. This project uses state-level variation in the financing of UI and other social insurance programs, such as workersâ€™ compensation, to analyze the effect of social insurance financing on firm behavior and outcomes. How do firms respond to the funding mechanisms in their state and how does that feeds back into the economy as a whole?"
