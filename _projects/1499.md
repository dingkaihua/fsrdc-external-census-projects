abstract: "This project examines the resilience of regions and firms in the context of the recent Great Recession and prior economic recessions. When faced with a negative economic shock, the presence of clusters – geographic concentrations of related industries, firms, and supporting institutions – in a region could mitigate the effects of the negative shock. Agglomeration economies arise in regional clusters of related economic activity, and the interconnection of industries (and associated firms) could facilitate a faster recovery from a recession. Using data from the U.S. Cluster Mapping Project (USCMP) and the Longitudinal Business Database, this projects examines whether industries in strong clusters experience faster growth (as measured by employment, wage, entrepreneurship, innovation or productivity) before, during, and/or after the recession period than industries located in weak clusters. A related aspect of regional (and firm) resilience is the ability of a region or firm to diversify and re-invent itself. This project examines the role of related economic diversifications on the recovery of regions and firms. Further, the distribution of economic success within regions is often uneven, and pockets of concentrated poverty and high unemployment rates persist in American cities. Using data from the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, the USCMP, and the Census Bureau, this projects explores whether clusters matter for the performance of inner cities, investigating if integrating inner cities into the cluster composition of their regions would lead to more effective employment outcomes."
