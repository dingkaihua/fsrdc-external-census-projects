abstract: " 
Although entrepreneurship is a vital source of economic growth, information on rural entrepreneurship is sparse. The lack of rural entrepreneurship information leaves rural stakeholders dependent on statistics that may not reflect rural entrepreneurial activity. For example, do published Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey statistics accurately reflect rural entrepreneurship activity? Does rural entrepreneurship differ from nonrural entrepreneurship? If so, does U.S. Census Bureau data accurately reflect the rural component of entrepreneurship, or does rural response idiosyncrasies lead to systematic bias in published data? 
This proposal will first analyze such potential bias in Census Bureau statistics, then explore the development of new methodologies that the Census Bureau could use to publish new statistics on rural entrepreneurship. Rural will be defined in two ways: places with less than 2,500 people and as nonmetropolitan areas. 
The projectâ€™s first stage will analyze the factors contributing to the success and growth of new firms in rural and nonrural locations. The result will be a better understanding of how firm success is affected by the characteristics of individual entrepreneurs, by the characteristics of the firms they form, and by the communities in which businesses are located. If the factors contributing to firm success differ by rural/nonrural location, rural entrepreneurship is indeed different than metro entrepreneurship, and Census Bureau statistics could be biased if rural firms are under- or overrepresented in summary statistics. By using both urban/rural and metro/nonmetro definitions, the use of the metro/nonmetro definition as a proxy for the urban/rural definition can be explored. 
The second stage of the analysis will develop a methodology that could be used to publish new statistics on entrepreneurship from the Census Bureau. At the national level, entrepreneurship has been clearly demonstrated to be a vital source of economic growth. The lack of entrepreneurship data at sub-national level limits the ability to study the relationship between entrepreneurship and regional economic growth. An entrepreneurship index that satisfies Census Bureau disclosure requirements will be developed for various geographic regions. Entrepreneurship is a multifaceted concept that cannot be characterized by business starts alone, further justifying the development of a broader index measure. All project results will be made publicly available, subject to Census Bureau disclosure rules. 
This proposal will use the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from 1976 to current, the 1992 CBO Survey, and the 1992 Survey of Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises (SMWOBE) as the basis for the analysis. The proposal requests the use of the Standard Statistical Establishment Listing (SEEL) to explore rural/nonrural responses/nonresponse bias. 2002 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) data are also requested if they become available prior to proposal termination. The CBO, SMWOBE, and LBD will be used to identify new firm start-ups, measure their growth, identify the individual and firm characteristics of rural entrepreneurs, and analyze the difference between rural and nonrural entrepreneurs. Moreover, the project will characterize nonresponse (item and respondent from the CBO and SMWOBE) specifically using information on rural/nonrural status. The methodologies and recommendations produced are expected to apply to the upcoming publications of the 2002 SBO."
