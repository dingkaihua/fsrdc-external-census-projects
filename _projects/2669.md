abstract: "This project exploits a recent court decision that limited the patent eligibility of software and business method patents to measure what happens to market entry for firms in software-oriented markets. This sheds light on the role of intellectual property rights for economic decision making, so far underexplored in existing data and surveys provided by the Census. To this end, this project will generate reduced form estimates on the impact of patent protection on firm entry and exit, as well as detailed insight into how business models, investments, and financial and innovation decisions are impacted by the ability to patent certain types of business methods and software applications."
