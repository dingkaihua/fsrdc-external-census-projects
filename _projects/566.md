abstract: "This project explores the firm level drivers of innovation outsourcing, such as exploratory research performed, inventory turnover, and consequences such as innovation costs and other financial outcomes. Industry level moderators of these relationships are also proposed.  This research project investigates the extent to which increased outsourcing of research and development (R&D) recategorizes innovation activities, which, if carried out internally, would be classified as manufacturing but when contracted to a specialist firm is categorized as a service.  Time series analysis of shifts from manufacturing to nonmanufacturing will illustrate the extent to which the growth of contract R&D creates (or does not create) a measurement problem and give insight into the comparability of historical data with more recent years’ data.  The project will compute Herfindahl indexes for nonmanufacturing industries. The Census Bureau currently publishes Herfindahl indexes for the manufacturing sector but not for nonmanufacturing. This project will provide estimates of how firm and industry characteristics differentially influence the propensity to outsource innovation activities, as well as the consequences of this outsourcing.  This study links the Survey of Industrial Research and Development, the Longitudinal Business Database and Compustat for the years 1972–2001. Two external, publicly available databases are also required: The National Bureau of Economic Research’s “U.S. Patent Citations Data File” as well as the Census Bureau’s “Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing” dataset.  Once assembled, these datasets will be used to test a multilevel model that examines firm and industry level factors influencing the propensity to outsource R&D as well as the outcomes of this outsourcing."
