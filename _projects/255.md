abstract: "Our study will investigate the role the individual health insurance market in California plays in covering the population. It will examine the objective factors, motivations, and attitudes that influence consumers’ decisions to participate in the individual market; how changes in price, benefits design, and public policies would affect that role and the number of uninsured; how purchasers of coverage decide among the plans available to them; and patterns of entry and exit from the individual market for health insurance. We propose to use pooled cross-section and time-series data from two Census surveys—the March Current Population Survey (years 1996 through 2001) and the 1996 SIPP panel—to study decisions to purchase insurance by the potential market in California.
The specific questions we will answer using the CPS and SIPP include:
• What share of the potential market purchases individual coverage in California? How does this vary among important population subgroups?
• What factors influence the decision to purchase individual insurance? Specifically, what is the role of variables that might be affected by factors such as price, nature and number of products available?
• Does the availability of safety net providers affect decisions, especially of the near poor? Is there health selection in participation?
• Does greater diversity in the nature of products available increase market segmentation and alter the health risks participating in the market?
• What affects intra-family decisions about coverage for individual family members?
The study would benefit the Census Bureau in several ways. First, we will increase the utility of the Census data by using it to address important health care issues that we expect will help inform the decision making progress. In addition, to providing estimates of important behavioral relationships in the population, the analysis will yield important descriptive information about those who purchase in the individual insurance market. Second, we will be estimating models using multiple household surveys. Similarities or differences in modeling results will yield information about the reliability and validity of measures from the various surveys. In addition, we have administrative data from insurers in California that we can use to help assess the validity of survey measures. (For example, we can compare average duration of coverage measured in the SIPP panel with duration from administrative records. Any restricted administrative data from participating insurers will be analyzed outside of the Census data center.) Finally, our project statistician is developing ways of combining nonlinear regressions analyses from multiple household surveys that could be used by other researchers."
