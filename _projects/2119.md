abstract: "This project studies the impact of high-skilled immigration on the labor market outcomes of similarly-skilled native workers and of those from different skill groups by creating a linked USCIS-LEHD dataset capable of measuring the level of high-skilled immigration for the U.S. labor force. Specially, to further investigate the impact on the native STEM workers, we will link USCIS-LEHD to the annual American Community Survey to obtain degree information. This project also tests how the changes in high-skilled immigration affect the productivity and innovation of the firms hiring H-1B workers by linking USICS-LEHD to SIRD, BRDIS and USPTO patenting data. Additionally, through the combination of LCA data, Harte-Hanks data, and ACS data, we are able to identify the client firms of the IT consulting companies. Thus, we are able to further study how H-1B workers introduced through outsourcing services impact the client firms and their workers. Finally, this project also examines the effect of changes in the H-1B visa cap on the educational decisions and labor market outcomes of foreign-born workers, as well as on firm outcomes."
