abstract: "Residential segregation by race and income is an enduring feature of the landscape of American metropolitan areas. Despite some declines over the last forty years, in 2010, almost two-thirds of black households and half of Hispanic households would have had to move to achieve complete integration with the white population. Income segregation, on the other hand, has increased over time and has accelerated over the last decade. The endurance of residential segregation is particularly interesting given the high rates of residential mobility among American households. In fact, half of all households in the U.S. change residences over a five-year period. The scope, scale, and predictors of the geographic mobility of households have evolved over time and have varied across metropolitan areas. Much less is known, however, about how households choose where to move. This project will use discrete choice models that frame geographic mobility as a multidimensional process where the decision to move is modelled using an extensive set of neighborhood characteristics. The estimates will show the probability of moving to a neighborhood given the socioeconomic characteristics of a household and given the socioeconomic characteristics of potential neighborhood destinations within a metropolitan area. The discrete choice models will be used to simulate the conditions of residential mobility that can achieve lower levels of residential segregation. This research may generate important insights into how changing geographic mobility across racial and income groups can also change aggregate segregation levels by race and income."
