abstract: "This project will examine and compare the establishment-level responses of labor demand to productivity and business cycle fluctuations using the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), Census of Manufactures (CM), and the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (QPC). The growth rates of production hours per worker, revenue, and employment by establishment size and age classification will be calculated for both the QPC and ASM/CM. The research will document the correlation of these establishment-class growth rates in hours, productivity, and employment with aggregate and regional business conditions. Using multiple econometric techniques, the project will document the differences in volatility, correlation, and magnitudes of the hours and employment adjustments of establishments by age and size categories. The study will also provide estimates for the revenue productivity of establishments in the ASM/CM data, controlling for the endogeneity of productivity and intermediate input demand. In addition, this project will examine the quality of voluntary responses in the QPC relative to the mandatory ASM/CM in several ways. "
