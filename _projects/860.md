abstract: "This project investigates the relationship between product quality and shipping costs. Using the Commodity Flow Surveys and the Census of Manufactures of 1997, 2002, and 2007, establishment-level regressions of output unit values on shipment distance, and input unit values on average shipment distance, will test whether establishments sell higher-quality goods to more distant destinations. Using these domestic data is a significant improvement relative to existing studies (which use national export data) due to the precision of the distance measures and the data on shipments originating from many locations."
