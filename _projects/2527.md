abstract: "To what extent are workers' careers tied to the fate of their employers? How does worker composition change over a firm's life cycle? And how are firms' incentives to invest and expand tied to worker dynamics? These questions are fundamental for understanding the interaction between workers and firms in the U.S. labor market. Existing studies of worker and firm heterogeneity usually take a static view of the labor market, in which the dynamics of firms (e.g., firm entry, exit, and growth) do not affect worker outcomes. Conversely, the dynamics of workers (e.g., worker transitions and life-cycle mobility patterns) do not affect firm outcomes. This project will explore the empirical relationship between worker and firm dynamics over time and space using the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and the Economic Census datasets of the U.S. Census Bureau. The project investigates three sets of empirical hypotheses. First, it examines how workers' attachment to their birth county and state affects their mobility and wages, and analyzes whether firms' location decisions are influenced by workers' regional attachment. Second, the project studies whether certain groups of workers benefit more from working at "high-productivity" firms than others, and whether differences in geographical or industrial mobility explain these results. Finally, the project tests whether younger employers are equally attractive to work for, conditional on pay, as old employers and analyzes to what extent employer pay and nonpay amenities determine worker attraction and retention."
