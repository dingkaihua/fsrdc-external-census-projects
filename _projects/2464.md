abstract: "Rates of national product market concentration in the US have increased markedly since the 1980s. The primary goal of this project is to assess whether changes in firm-level innovation behavior can explain this trend. To do so, we will connect data on innovation from the Survey of Industrial Research and Development, the Business R&D and Innovation Survey, and the Business R&D Survey, together with detailed production data from other Census databases, particularly the Census of Manufactures (CMF) and Longitudinal Business Database. Using this data, we will measure innovation concentration: the distribution of innovation activity across differently sized firms. Accordingly, we will estimate empirical models that project R&D characteristics on measures of firm size. Using unique innovation information from the BRDIS and product-level sales from the CMF, we will extend our empirical analysis to innovation by type: internal (towards market areas the firm is already active in) and external (towards market areas new to the firm). Finally, motivated by our empirical findings, we will build and estimate a quantitative model of endogenous firm dynamics and employ it to analyze the contribution of different kinds of innovation to changes in market concentration."
