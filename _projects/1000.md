abstract: "This project primarily uses Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data to analyze the transitional dynamics of workers and adjustment of firms to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. FMLA mandated large employers to provide job-protected unpaid leave for specified family and medical reasons. Little is known about how firms and workers have responded to this mandate. This project investigates whether the firms that qualify for FMLA have changed the employment composition of their workforce, if earnings and promotions of workers in those firms have adjusted to reflect the cost of the FMLA mandate, the impacts of the law on leave taking, hours of work, fertility, and employer based health insurance of the workforce, and if firms themselves have changed their size in response to FMLA, since only firms with 50 or more employees are subject to the law. This project also employs data from the Longitudinal Business Database, American Community Survey (for information on fertility and health insurance), and Current Population Surveys (for information on leave taking and hours of work)."
