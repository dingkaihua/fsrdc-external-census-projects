abstract: "We propose to study the role played by large firms in the Pennsylvania economy by analyzing census data on manufacturing firms to determine these firms' economic importance in terms of wages, productivity, and employment. This analysis will include an examination of wages, productivity, capital Investment, exposure to international trade, occupational specialization (production and non-production workers), and job growth among manufacturing firms in the state from 1963 to 1992. We will examine trends through time and compare state and U.S. experiences. We also will look at the existence of spillover effects and determine how they vary by sector and space and through time. The project will generate several new insights important to the scholarly and policy communities. First, it will demonstrate the existence of spillovers and their variations by sector, providing a test of the oft-cited lead firm concept. Second, the study will contribute to the growing body of research chronicling the evolution of mature industrial economies. Third, it will be disseminated to policy makers and form the basis for an evolving dialogue on the role of large firms in regional economies."
