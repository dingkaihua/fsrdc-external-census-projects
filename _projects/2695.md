abstract: "The United States incarceration rate is more than six times the incarceration rate of a typical OECD country. Additionally, the United States spends around $250 on total correctional expenditures per capita. This number has tripled since 1980. In addition to this fiscal cost, incarceration has lasting negative effects on an individual's future. Given the large fiscal and social cost of incarceration, understanding cost-effective interventions that reduce criminality is important.

I plan to identify the effect of access to Medicaid on subsequent criminal behavior using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) exploiting a policy discontinuity where several Medicaid expansions in the 1980s and early 1990s only applied to those born after September 30, 1983. This variation is almost certainly exogenous since these expansions occurred well after 1983, making it impossible to sort around the cutoff. This policy discontinuity was first used by Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) to identify changes in insurance coverage and healthcare utilization. This discontinuity has been used to show that Medicaid eligibility reduces future teen mortality and adulthood hospitalizations. I would implement this RDD using day-of-birth cohort incarceration rates as the unit of observation.
An alternative identification strategy is to leverage differences across states and time in Medicaid expansion through the 1980s and 1990s using a two-way fixed effects model with simulated Medicaid eligibility. This approach has been widely used to study the effects of childhood Medicaid expansion. To use this strategy the unit of observation would be state month-of-birth cohorts.

The primary data set needed for this project is the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). Using CJARS, I can construct day-of-birth cohort totals for variables such as ever incarcerated, number of years incarcerated, ever charged with a crime, ever found guilty of crime, and ever arrested. Additionally, I would like to disaggregate these totals by race and sex. For the arrest and adjudication tables, I would like to disaggregate by offense type to explore what types of crime are averted. In addition to CJARS, I plan to use the public-use National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Birth Data Files. Using this data, I can calculate the number of people in each day-of-birth cohort for the states with the relevant CJARS coverage. With the criminal involvement totals from CJARS and total population from NVSS Birth Data, I can create rates for each cohort such as percent ever incarcerated. I can use the cohort rates to estimate an RDD.

To estimate a two-way fixed effects model, I can construct similar totals but for day-of-birth state cohorts. No variation in Medicaid eligibility changes within month, so month-of-birth state cohorts is also workable. I will then merge these rates simulated Medicaid eligibility from Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie (2020). This simulated Medicaid eligibility data contains the number of years eligible for Medicaid holding population characteristics fixed. Simulated Medicaid eligibility does not vary within state-month cohorts. It captures changes in Medicaid eligibility due to state law changes. Neither the RD nor two-way fixed-effects approaches need the CJARS data to be linked at the individual level."
