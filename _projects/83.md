abstract: "In this project, we propose to estimate an empirical model that describes the equilibrium location and employment decisions made by households and firms within a single metropolitan area. In our model, each household makes its residential location decision based on a wide variety of factors including characteristics of housing and schools, neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics, housing prices, other neighborhood amenities, and employment access. The employment of each household member is in turn influenced by his/her access to suitable jobs, neighborhood characteristics, and individual/household characteristics. Firms make decisions based on access to different types of workers, other firms, and customers, and in our most general specification a firmâ€™s location directly influences the characteristics of its workforce. These decisions combine to create a complex spatial equilibrium, which determines land use, prices, and wages throughout the metropolitan area. We use the estimates of this model to explore complex interactions in urban labor and housing markets, focusing on two well-known questions in which the simultaneity of the household residential location and employment decisions as well as the simultaneity of household and firm location decisions have been quite evident. These questions relate to whether access to employment influences labor market outcomes, and whether the quality of a neighborhood affects labor market outcomes. We begin this proposal by describing these important research questions and the difficulties researchers have had controlling for the endogeneity problems introduced by the simultaneity of these decisions. We then describe our methodology and explain how the estimates of our model can be used to shed new light on these questions."
