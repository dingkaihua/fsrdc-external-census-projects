abstract: "The main contribution of this paper is providing new facts on the growth of Professional Business Services (PBS) sectors and how they contribute to productivity in the economy. Specifically, we aim to (1) determine the role of improvements in IP law on growth of PBS sector, (2) analyze its implications on macroeconomic variables such as productivity, wage dispersion, job-to-job transitions and entrepreneurship and (3) measure how much flexibility is provided by outsourcing different inputs instead of hiring/purchasing them. Firstly, this project will use Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from 1976-2018 to determine whether the growth in PBS sector came from new firms, new locations and new establishments. Secondly, utilizing the Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and Service Annual Survey (SAS) for 2017, the relation between importance of secrets for different firms and their use of PBS will be analyzed. Thirdly, using the ASM, SAS, and related Economic Census (EC) surveys for manufacturers and service firms for 2012-2017, paper will try to estimate how purchase of PBS services complement/substitute low and high skill workers present at the firm as well as how it provides firms flexibility through idiosyncratic shocks."
