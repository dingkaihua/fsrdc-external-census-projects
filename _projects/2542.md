abstract: "In the past few decades, U.S. industries have experienced an increase in market concentration and productivity dispersion. The divergence in firm performance raises concerns regarding potential abuse of market and political power by large ``superstar'' firms, emphasizing the importance of understanding its underlying reasons. Recent literature has focused on the potential roles of the changes in the U.S. anti-trust regime and the rise of information technology (IT). This project studies the role of globalization, i.e. whether increased access to foreign output and input markets, concentrated within large firms, has amplified their ex-ante advantages in the U.S. market. We will use Census Bureau restricted data on foreign activity and firm performance to document how dispersion in access to foreign markets has evolved over time; how did increased market access affect domestic market shares and price-cost markups; and whether the differences in market access can explain observed changes in the distribution of productivity, sales and employment, and specifically the reallocation of production to large firms. We will study the mechanisms through which market access translates into domestic market power, such as process innovation, investment in intangible capital and access to cheap or high-quality inputs."
