abstract: "This study analyzes the link between the characteristics of firmsâ€™ labor forces (the human factor) and corporate restructuring decisions, such as plant closure and acquisitions. Specifically, it will analyze whether the labor composition and the wage structure of a plant or firm affects its probability of being shut down or of becoming a takeover target, and how factors such as experience, human capital, and wages explain the cross-sectional differences in worker retention decisions and firm performance following an acquisition or plant closure. The project uses employee information from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program, firm-level information from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), financial data from Compustat and information on corporate restructuring from the SDC Platinum Mergers and Acquisitions database. Additional data on manufacturing industries includes plant-level information from the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures to construct sharper estimates of changes in plant-level productivity around restructuring events. The project will evaluate the consistency of various databases maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and analyze the implications of any inconsistencies on census published statistics. Accurate information on corporate restructuring is especially important for time series and worker statistics, such as those produced by the LEHD program. Moreover, since the SDC data documents the time when restructuring becomes effective in the legal sense and census databases record the time when real changes are made (in terms of labor and capital), comparing these two sources will provide valuable information on the length of the integration process. Statistics on the changes in workforce composition and the change in the wage distribution after restructuring will be produced. Econometric models will estimate the effects of employee characteristics and the wage distribution on the likelihood of plant closure or takeover."
