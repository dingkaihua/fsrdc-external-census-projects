abstract: "This research uses 1960 Census and the March CPS supplement to create state and county level fertility rates across a number of decades and compares these with administrative records data from the National Center for Health Statistics. This will provide a better understanding of population trends and promote more accurate CPS-based population projections. This project will examine the economic, social, and demographic impacts of various policy and natural experiments."
