abstract: "How is urban space used to reproduce inequality? It has been documented that when urban areas are carved up into small, independent governmental jurisdictions, those areas tend to have greater racial, ethnic and economic segregation, more urban sprawl, and lower job growth. Some evidence indicates that the fragmentation of urban space in other ways, such as through the creation of gated communities, may also generate inequality. For example, gated communities may encourage resource hoarding and undermine political will to engage in regional problem-solving efforts, both of which impose disproportionate burdens on residents of nearby low-income neighborhoods. This project will empirically investigate the effects of gated communities on socioeconomic inequality. Our primary goal is to contribute to knowledge about whether and how residential gating affects the life chances of low-income individuals living in the surrounding area. We propose to assess the relationship between gated communities and socioeconomic inequality at the level of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA), using internal-use AHS data linked to MSA level characteristics available in the public ACS and Decennial Census, as well as data on economic mobility published by Harvard's Opportunity Insights. We will use a fixed-effects approach to investigate relationships between changes in the prevalence of gated communities and changes in inequality."
