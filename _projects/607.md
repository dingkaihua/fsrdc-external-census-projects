abstract: "This research aims to improve understanding of the quality of data on advertising agencies collected by the Census Bureau; assess the importance of scale and scope economies in the supply of advertising and marketing service industries; explore the relation of such economies to the overall organization of this industry in terms of the distribution of revenue and employment among single and multiestablishment firms and holding companies; examine employment turnover and advertising firm entry, survival, and exit patterns over time; and document the geographical distribution of advertising agencies and their economic activities. Census data are linked to external data on advertising agencies, specifically the Advertising Red Book.  The project compares census data coverage with publicly available data on advertising agencies.  The project will produce estimates of the population of advertising establishments, which will inform the Census Bureau’s knowledge base on the extent of scale and scope economies in the supply of advertising and marketing service industries and the relation of such economies to the overall organizational structure of firms in this industry. It will examine entry, exit, and acquisitions at various levels of aggregation—individual establishment, the multi-establishment advertising agency, and the global holding companies. And it will investigate the role of mergers and acquisitions on the extent of outsourcing and measurement of output, price, average labor productivity, and labor turnover."
