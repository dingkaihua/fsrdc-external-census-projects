abstract: "The increase in income inequality in the 1990s, among other reasons, has led to a new focus on measuring the impact of social effects on economic behavior. One important component of social effects is the impact of one's place of residence, or neighborhood effects. We propose to extend earlier work (Ioannides and Zabel 1999) to include neighborhood choice in our model of housing demand with neighborhood effects. We will model the choice of community via the choice of census tract and neighborhood (cluster) of residence. This requires that we have knowledge of the census tract in which each household in the AHS resides. This is an important component of our analysis of neighborhood effects since the choice of neighborhood is not random and hence estimation of these effects should take this nonrandom choice into consideration."
