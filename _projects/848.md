abstract: "This project tests for key relationships between entrepreneurship, personal credit and income history, and firm success. In particular, this research will shed light on the role of credit constraints on individual decisions regarding personal and business finance. These relationships are essential for understanding (a) consumption patterns including delinquency, default, and bankruptcy; (b) formation, success, and failure of small business funded by personal finance; (c) the link between human capital accumulation and the availability of credit; and (d) firm credit history and the mergers and acquisitions of firms."
