abstract: "We propose to study the implications of the changing firm distribution for macroeconomic dynamics and inequality in the United States since 1977. To precisely measure how rising industrial concentration has shifted the ownership of establishments toward multi-market firms, we plan to link multiple Census Bureau microdata sources, including the Annual Surveys, Economic Censuses, Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). We develop a flexible method for high-dimensional data to construct new annual estimates of establishment-level sales and productivity. This method deploys a Bayesian interpolation procedure on the sparse time series of establishment-level data from the five-year Economic Census to interpolate measures in missing years, incorporating a rich set of establishment-, firm-, and region-level characteristics. We will use these interpolated variables to examine the economic consequences of increasing concentration in two areas. First, our work studies the potential for large firms to amplify short-run economic fluctuations. We will examine how shocks to a large firm's financial health or technological capabilities can have persistent effects on regions due to spillovers onto workers and other businesses. We will also estimate the extent to which large, multi-unit firms make joint employment and investment decisions in a way that causes business cycle shocks to propagate across the regions or workers in the firm's network. Second, we will study how the expansion of large firms has contributed to longer-run trends in business dynamics, worker earnings, and regional inequality."
