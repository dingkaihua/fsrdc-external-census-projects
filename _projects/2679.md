abstract: "Pareto established a century ago that large incomes follow a power law, but the body of the income distribution is still largely uncharacterized. Rather, authors have modeled incomes using a variety of different distributions including generalized beta, a combination of log-normal and Pareto, and a combination of Boltzman-Gibbs and Pareto. Historically, modeling choices have been even more varied. For this project, I will fill this gap in the literature by establishing which distribution or select multiple distributions fit the data most closely. I will estimate the model parameters and show the fit visually, and I will analyze the error under the best-fitting parametric model. I will use Current Population Survey data from 1970 to 2020 as available, and I will base my analysis on the variables that measure total income and income of different types at the individual, family, and household level. Plotting both the model and the sample density on top of one another allows for a clear and easy judgement on the various fits. I will use both a linear plot to evaluate the fit in the body of the distribution and a log-log plot to evaluate the fit in the tail. My project requires access to restricted data because using publicly available, top-coded data will introduce an unknown amount of error into my estimates. If the error is extreme, it may become less clear which distribution matches most closely."
