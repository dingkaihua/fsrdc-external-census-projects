abstract: "An economic evaluation of how plants respond to particular instances of administered protection would improve Census Bureau data, general decision-making capabilities, and the understanding of the plant-level impacts of protection. Administered trade is extended through various segments of the federal government to industries under duress from unfair trade practices. The actual impacts of such trade policy actions are unclear, both practically and academically. This project intends to prepare estimates of productivity for certain industries, thereby adding to available estimates that describe the characteristics of the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Possible shortcomings and the documentation of new data collection needs will derive from our comparisons of estimated industry productivity for actual Annual Survey of Manufactures respondents and estimates based of LRD imputations for non-respondents. Differences may be significant between the two, due to the disparities in the possible conditions of plants used for imputation relative to the state of plants for which data was imputed. Lastly, this project intends to help understand LRD based estimates of productivity in relation to alternative productivity measures."
