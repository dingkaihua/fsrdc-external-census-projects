abstract: "This project studies innovation and research and development in the spirit of Schumpeter where innovation and research and development (R&D) are part of the process of creative destruction in the economy. Using data on both public and private firms, it examines how firm organization changes following innovation that is initiated by itself, or by firms in its own upstream and downstream industries. It also studies the impact of firm organization on the exploitation of R&D expenditures and patents. The central premise of this study is that organizations adjust to industry technological change as both additional research and the development of ideas after patents require extensive organizational and financial resources. It focuses on two types of organizational adaptations: the decision to be private or publicly listed and changes in firm boundaries through mergers and acquisitions. Firms differ in the extent of their operations across multiple industries. Some firms choose to be focused and produce in single industries. Other firms produce in multiple industries. The central question is the extent that these two dimensions are significant in explaining which firms conduct and then commercialize research and patent activity. This project will provide evidence on the importance of research and the development of that research in determining the boundaries of the firm by examining three different aspects of innovative activity. These include patent activity, patent citations, and R&D expenditures."
