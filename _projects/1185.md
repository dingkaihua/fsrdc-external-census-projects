abstract: "This project compares innovative activities of public firms with observably similar private firms to investigate whether public and private firms innovate differently. The research estimates the causal impact of ownership structures on firms' R&D behaviors, the novelty of innovation, the sources of R&D funding, and whether firms conduct in-house R&D or acquire external technologies. The project also evaluates the quality of Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) data for responses to new measures for worldwide operations such as worldwide net sales and revenues, total worldwide costs, worldwide R&D expenses and compensations, worldwide R&D agreements, worldwide R&D employees, scientists and engineers, as well as worldwide R&D performed by others. The analysis compares the measures and reports of firms' worldwide operations to their counterparts in Compustat, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."
