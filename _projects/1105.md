abstract: "The ways in which external economic forces influence firm-level input and output decisions have important implications for economic welfare and social well-being. Firms and plant-owners often make decisions to maximize profits or shareholder value, and they may not fully internalize the effects of their production decisions on the local economy in which they are located. Similarly, firm owners or managers do not necessarily internalize the potential long run costs to workers when making plant layoff decisions. In some cases, these externalities create market failures. Addressing these externalities requires a proper understanding both of how external economic forces influence firm and worker decisions as well as how these decisions influence long run costs and economic incidence. This project will characterize how external market and non-market forces influence firm and worker behavior, while also evaluating the costs and incidence of sectoral reallocation of the labor market more generally. The researchers will evaluate the costs and incidence of sectoral reallocation in the labor market using the longitudinal earnings and employment records from the LEHD infrastructure file. This research will produce estimates quantifying how changes in demand drive employment responses and worker outcomes in the automobile industry and how demand shocks in a particular industry may propagate to nearby industries. The researchers will also evaluate how environmental regulation influences the type of worker hired at newly regulated firms. In addition, this research will evaluate how environmental regulation influences technology choice within a firm, and how these technology choices influence the skill mix and wage structure within that particular firm."
