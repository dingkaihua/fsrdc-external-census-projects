abstract: "This research examines the effect of concentrated ownership on employment, wages, productivity, and firm dynamics. The project will create a new bridge linking Compustat, the Thomson Reuters Mutual Fund and Institutional Owners database, and the Levenstein and Suslow (2016) data on interfirm cooperation to the Census Bureauâ€™s Business Register. These databases provide detailed information on the shareholders of firms and the controlling financial interest that links firms. Combining these data with market share information from Census Bureau data allows the construction of generalized HHI market concentration measures. The researchers will analyze employment and productivity-related outcomes by comparing highly concentrated markets to less concentrated markets and will estimate the effects of their market concentration measure on the outcomes noted above.
