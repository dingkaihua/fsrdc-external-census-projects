abstract: "In this study, we examine the effect of individuals' prior work experience on future labor market outcomes. Our first objective is to understand how the labor force differs along dimensions of firm characteristics like size and reputation by using descriptive statistics to generate stylized facts. Our second objective is to estimate the effect of individual employees' experience in larger / more reputable firms on those individuals' future labor market outcomes like earnings and unemployment. Combining individual-level data from the LEHD, CPS, and ACS with firm-level LBD and SAS data, we merge the combined Census dataset with external data with additional firm level characteristics like market value and ownership structure. From this data, we expect to find that prior experience in larger more reputable firms affects individual's future labor outcomes in the form or higher earnings and lower probability of unemployment. While prior research documents that the characteristics of an employee's current employer firm, like size and reputation, on individual's current wages and salaries, this study is important because it examines the role of prior experience, which has received less attention due to the inability to track the career paths of individuals employees using other data sources."
