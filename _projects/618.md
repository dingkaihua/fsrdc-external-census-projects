abstract: "This research project employs data that will enable a better understanding of the impact a region’s economic composition has on its economic performance, the impact of diﬀerences in the geographic proﬁle of regions on this relationship, and the impact of the cluster composition and performance of neighboring regions on a region’s economic performance. Previous work on the relationship between cluster composition and the economic performance of regions and their clusters has revealed data limitations, in particular the signiﬁcant level of data suppression of industry-level data in smaller, largely rural regions. Using the economic census and the Longitudinal Business Database, this project will investigate the ability of a cluster concept of collocated industries (those linked through their supply chain and other agglomeration forces) to pro-vide an opportunity to publish regional aggregations with less need for disclosure suppressions. The project will further investigate the deﬁnitions of clusters and their development over time. The research will generate estimates of the economic performance of a region and its clusters. It aims at a more sophisticated understanding of linkages across clusters within a region and of linkages between regions, and to develop typologies of regional economies by cluster proﬁles and other dimensions."
