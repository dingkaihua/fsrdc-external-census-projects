abstract: "American public opinion reﬂects a growing concern about employment stability and a weakening of the bond between employer and employee. Less stability means more frequent interﬁrm job changes that can result in interruptions in company beneﬁts (especially health insurance), decreases or stagnation in wages, and involuntary entry into contingent or temporary employment relations. This project examines interﬁrm mobility by introducing locality into an analysis of the retail industry. Job mobility is best gauged with measures of the dynamic characteristics of firms as they function in their local context. At the organizational level, workers in locally oriented retail business establishments exhibit different mobility pat-terns than their counterparts employed in non-locally oriented ﬁ rms. This research seeks to analyze the inﬂuence of local organizational and labor market dynamics on interﬁrm mobility of workers, examine the mobility of workers in locally oriented and non-locally oriented ﬁrms with special attention to times of economic expansion and recession, and explore the direction of interﬁrm mobility in terms of earnings stability, appreciation, or depreciation over time."
