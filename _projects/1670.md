abstract: "This project examines the role of increased trade exposure in the decline of entrepreneurship and the consequences for aggregate employment and productivity growth. This research is motivated by the burgeoning recent literature documenting that the rise in import competition from China and other low wage countries in the early 2000s has exerted important negative effects on employment, while simultaneously leading to increased technical change within firms and reallocation of employment towards more productive firms. This project addresses a set of important questions that have so far been left unexplored: What are the effects of increased trade exposure on startup rates and the post-entry dynamics of firms in terms of survival and employment growth? What is the role of offshoring in explaining these employment effects? How do firms react to increased trade exposure in terms of capital intensity, technical change, organization, and management practices? To what extent can increased trade exposure, through its impact on firm dynamics, account for the slowdown in aggregate employment and productivity growth observed in U.S. data? "
