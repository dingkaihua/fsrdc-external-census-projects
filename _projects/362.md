abstract: "This project aims to provide the Census Bureau with a new set of stylized facts and statistics pertaining to the life-cycle behavior of the size distribution of firms in U.S. manufacturing industries. This goal will be achieved by analyzing the evolution of the size distribution of firms in an industry as the industry goes through its life cycle, i.e. different stages of growth. The size distribution of firms is intimately related to important industry aggregates, including inter-firm distribution of productivity, as well as to differences among firms in terms of production technology and product mix. Despite the importance of a comprehensive understanding of changes in the size distribution of firms in an industry over time, little has been done so far to uncover the nature of such changes. When all manufacturing firms are considered together, it is well known that the size distribution of firms, measured either by employment or value of output, is quite stable over time (see, e.g., Ijiri and Simon (1977), Sutton (1997), Axtell (2001)). However, theories of industry dynamics and finer industry level data (e.g., Gort and Klepper (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990)) suggest that this aggregate stability masks significant underlying inter-industry heterogeneity. As industries experience growth, shakeout, stability and decline phases, the size distribution of firms is predicted to exhibit significant changes. Models of industry life-cycle (e.g., Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994)) and empirical findings regarding firm and plant dynamics (e.g. Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1988, 1990)) collectively suggest that the size distribution is likely to be right skewed during the early phases of an industry, because initially most firms are small. As the industry grows and more entry occurs, the size distribution is expected to shift to the left and become even more right skewed, since most entering firms are small. Correspondingly, when an industry experiences its shakeout phase, small firms are more likely to exit the industry and the importance of larger firms in the size distribution increases. Thus, we expect to observe a decline in the skewness of firm size and rightward shift in firm size distribution. These general predictions, not to mention other, more detailed, hypotheses based on specifics of particular models of industry evolution, have not been tested before. The prevalence of these patterns across different industries, and even whether any generalizations are possible, is ultimately an empirical question. Our goals are to provide a comprehensive documentation of the evolution of the size distribution, and to establish a link between the patterns observed and theories of industry dynamics and evolution. The empirical analysis in this project requires observations on alternative measures of firm size for all firms over several time periods and across narrowly defined industries. Unfortunately, no public dataset meets these criteria simultaneously: measures of firm size at the individual firm level are not publicly available for a comprehensive set of industries and time periods. Publicly available datasets only provide information about plant size, as opposed to firm size. Furthermore, plant size information is in the form of discrete size ranges, as opposed to individual observations. Finally, the only measure of plant size in public data is employment, which is not the ideal measure from a theoretical point of view. We therefore propose to use the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) and the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) for the analysis of firm size distribution. Since the nature of the analysis is dynamic, the data for all available years (1963, 1967, and for each year between 1972 and 2002) will be utilized, subject to availability. The size distribution of firms will be constructed for each 4-digit industry. The LRD and the ASM provide several measures of firm size, such as employment, output and sales, which will be obtained by aggregating the corresponding size measures provided for all the plants of a firm. This firm level information will be aggregated to a size distribution, and to statistics that describe the distribution of firm size, e.g., skewness, variance, and kurtosis. The evolution of these statistics will be investigated using a variety of statistical and econometric procedures. The life-cycle analysis benefits the Census Bureau programs by providing a new set of statistics and stylized facts on the evolution of the size distribution. Several new population estimates will be obtained for firms and industries in the LRD database as a result of the statistical analysis we plan to carry out. The project will help understand and evaluate the quality and relevance of the different measures of firm size, a subject on which theory, thus far, has not been informative. This will in turn assist the Census Bureau in development of more useful questions pertaining to size of an establishment in future surveys. Simultaneously utilizing the confidential data in the LRD and the publicly available NBER/CES Manufacturing Productivity Database and the County Business Patterns (CBP) Database will provide an independent way of validating the quality of data in the NBER Productivity Database and CBP Database at the industry level."
