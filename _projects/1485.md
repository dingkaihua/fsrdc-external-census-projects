abstract: "This research seeks a deeper understanding of (1) how political institutions in partner countries (for example, democracy, autocracy, anocracy) affect the international competitiveness of U.S. firms, (2) which products that U.S. firms export and import are especially sensitive to political institutions in partner countries, and (3) whether institutions in partner countries influence the decision by U.S. firms to expand on the extensive margin (i.e., to enter new markets). These questions underlie the nature of trade between countries and how that has evolved in the past and how it may be expected to evolve in the future. The first research question seeks an explanation of how the exports and imports of U.S. firms adapt to real-world institutions in their partner countries. The second research question takes this inquiry to the product level and asks whether partner-country institutions enhance or obstruct the competitiveness of specific products that U.S. firms export. The third research question remains unexplored at present, but the growing importance of global supply chains makes this imperative. The decision by firms to enter new markets, or expand trade on the extensive margin, is decisive in the formation of supply chains, and this project attempts to fill an important gap in the literature by quantifying how this decision is influenced by institutions in partner countries."
