abstract: "This research addresses the following questions related to the impact of the current recession on rental affordability in the United States.  Are there statistically significant changes in average rental costs, the rental cost-to-income ratio, the physical attributes of rental housing units, and renter socio-economic characteristics from 2007 to 2009?  If so, are there any geographic disparities?  How do household characteristics, physical rental housing attributes, neighborhood characteristics, housing foreclosure rates, and fair market rents relate to rental housing affordability measured as rental housing cost burden?"
