abstract: "The vast majority of the accounting and finance literature studies corporate policies such as financing and investment decisions to understand differences in firm performance. However, it is extremely difficult to empirically determine firm-specific, "optimal" capital structure or the "optimal" investment level or compensation policy, making the measurement of over or under-investment hard. We aim to match companies' restricted economic data with researcher-collected data about firms' stated corporate practices and philosophies to address this issue. Results will reveal how corporate practice and philosophy impact establishment and firm economic outcomes and worker turnover."
