abstract: "In the past three decades, the number of robots has increased by more than 400 percent in both Europe and the US (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017) . Automation has rapidly become one of the most debated political and economic issues in many countries. But why do firms decide to automate and what are the consequences of these decisions for workers and local communities?

This project will add to our understanding of the causes and consequences of automation by constructing firm-level measures of automation, which we will use to isolate the effects of automation on workers' employment trajectories and on their political behavior. We will leverage the fact that, because most industrial robots are imported from abroad, we can observe firms' purchases of robots in product-level trade data. 

The first part of our analysis will look at why firms decided to automate, focusing on two potential channels: (1) changes in the cost of labor, and (2) changes in the composition of the labor force. We will then analyze its impact on workers' employment and earnings trajectories, by comparing workers in firms that choose to automate with a matched sample of control workers. The final part of the project will link these effects to political outcomes. Are communities (or groups of individuals) that are more affected by automation more likely to start supporting policies that would shield them against labor market competition (including from robots)?  Are they more politically engaged?  We will answer these questions by comparing the evolution of vote shares and turnout in Congressional and Presidential elections in areas that were more or less exposed to automation."
