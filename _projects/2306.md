abstract: "This projects investigates how the transmission of monetary policy to wages and employment depends on the size distribution of firms in the economy. We first study the firm-level wage and employment response to identified high-frequency monetary policy shocks. This allows us to examine whether these responses vary systematically along three dimensions: (i) the size of firms, (ii) the national market share of firms, and (iii) the market structure of the location in which the firm operates. To rationalize the findings, we construct a New-Keynesian model with heterogeneous firms. The model is estimated via indirect inference, targeting the estimates of the reduced form regressions. Finally, we use the model to assess how the observed shift in the US firm size distribution during the past three decades impacted the transmission of monetary policy."
