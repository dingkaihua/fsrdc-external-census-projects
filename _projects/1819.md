abstract: "In this research, we study how firm-level worker flows affect the earnings growth that workers experience when they switch from one firm to another. While it is well-documented that earnings grow disproportionately during employer transitions, worker-side survey data are silent on the effect on this growth from shocks on the origin and the destination employers. Using matched employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, we estimate how the employers' net size changes and turn-over rate affect workersâ€™ earnings in transition. Particularly, we estimate the contribution of job destruction at the origin to lower earnings growth and of job creation at the destination to higher growth. Turn-over also notably affects earnings growth as climbing the job wage-ladder is closely associated with job switches to employers with declining gross hires. We quantify how worker transitions with the flow of employment towards faster-growing employers, contribute more substantially to total earnings growth than simple reallocation."
