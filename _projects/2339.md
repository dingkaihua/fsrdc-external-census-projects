abstract: "We investigate whether historical information about a firm's performance along financial, accounting, and social and environmental dimensions impacts the starting wages demanded by its new workers. Specifically, we examine whether publicly available performance information affects a firm's "attractiveness" to workers, and whether a firm's financial performance at the time of hiring affects employees' accumulative future incomes. The accounting and finance literature finds evidence that firms exercise financing and reporting discretions to maintain the perceptions of employment security, and that a significant portion of wage differences is attributable to firm specific factors. However, there is limited evidence on the impact of firm performance, both financial and social performance, on the demanding wage at the time of hiring and its actual relation with workers' future income. Using the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and other firm-level datasets on firm performance, our research aims to better understand the role of public performance information in workers' employment decisions and the overall human capital allocation."
