abstract: "The aim of the proposed research project is to study the workings of internal capital markets. These are of primary importance in the capital allocation process in most developed economies, where a large fraction of investment decisions are made within big corporations. On average 60-80% of any new investment in the U.S. was financed through internal capital markets. Evidently, huge amounts of funds are not allocated via market prices in external capital markets, but through allocation mechanisms within the corporate hierarchy play a major role. However, we have only very limited understanding about what determines capital allocations within companies. One area where this problem manifests itself most prominently is corporate diversification. The two most prominent ideas are that internal capital markets either lead to 'winner-picking' of segments with good investment opportunities or inefficient cross-subsidization of under-performing segments. Using plant level data on investment, we plan to analyze the workings of internal capital markets in diversified firms. The structure of the LRD data provides a unique possibility to identify investment opportunities at the individual plant level. It allows us to form several different measures of investment opportunities to study how plant and segment level capital expenditures respond to changes in these measures. Because of the unique structure of the LRD, we will be able to differentiate between investments that are made at the individual plant level and investments that involve the decision to acquire or divest a whole plant or segment. The latter are normally decided at higher levels in the firm's hierarchy. The possibility to break down investment projects this way will allow us back out whether there exists a difference in the efficiency of projects that are decided at different levels in the organizational structure. Since the LRD itself does not provide information about which plants belong to a segment, we want to match COMPUSTAT Segment data to the LRD using a crosswalk developed by a researcher. Using plant level information from the LRD will be crucial to the proposed tests in this project. First, information form the LRD will allow us to analyze more precisely the extent and direction of capital flows across segments or plants. Since publicly available information from COMPUSTAT segment information files are prone to distortions due to managerial discretion and accounting requirements, the LRD gives a much more accurate picture of the different industries and lines of business a firm operates in. This will enable us to construct much more adequate measures of the investment opportunity set at the industry level than it is possible with publicly available data. Second, a main advantage lies with the fact that the LRD allows us to distinguish investments that are made at the individual plant level from those that are decisions to buy new plants or segments. This differentiation is possible due to the unique structure of the LRD, which surveys firms at the plant level."
